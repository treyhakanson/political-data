Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser, who chairs Donald Trump's Pro-Life Coalition, gave her assessment of Trump's outreach to evangelical and pro-life voters on Monday's Breitbart News Daily with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""I went from being critical to being very pleasantly surprised and encouraged,"" she said. ""He's doing a really good job of that. I think, first of all, and the only thing that really matters, is his policy commitments compared with hers, and they are great. They're huge.""She spoke highly of Trump's September letter to pro-life leaders, calling it ""better than any candidate letter I think I've ever seen.""""It's not just because of Kellyanne,"" Dannenfelser added, referring to Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway. ""He really cared a lot about how he worded this, compared with hers especially, meaning Hillary Clinton.

""They know what these commitments are. They know what the choice is. And they can't be fooled by listening to the mainstream media all day long. They're smart enough to tune that out, and look at what his commitments really are.""Dannenfelser acknowledged that Trump ""has changed his mind"" on the abortion issue. ""So did I,"" she noted. ""There are a lot of people who have flipped from pro-choice to pro-life.""She explained how Trump's pro-life position as a candidate is more important than past comments he made on the abortion issue as a private citizen:When you run for office, or you lead an organization, you have a much higher standard. You have to make solid commitments. Yes, he said he'll appoint pro-life judges, but also that he will, in the Oval Office, in his words, pass and sign that late-term bill - which ought to be an easy lift for any human being, a five-month pain-capable bill - but also defund Planned Parenthood, and make sure that the Hyde Amendment is made permanent law. So there are some things, there are many things, that a president can do, but not if the courts overturn every single action that he takes.Do I worry? Well, I've worried about every single candidate in whose election we've ever gotten involved. And so we don't just sit around and worry. We reach every single voter. We make sure that candidate knows every single voter is hearing those commitments, over and over and over again in the battleground states. That's what's happening today and tomorrow, and about a million people, or over a million people, in battleground states will hear that from our canvassers. And then, all along the way, reminding him of his commitments within the staff around him - I think that his commitments are reflected in the people that he has brought onto the campaign, as well. I don't know what else he could possibly do. There really isn't anything else that he can do, at this point.Marlow brought up a recent Washington Post column on Dannenfelser that said it was Trump's selection of Mike Pence as a running mate that brought her aboard the ""Trump Train.""""I just have to say, the Post got it mostly right,"" she replied:It is certainly Pence, but it's all those other things, too. In the end, this is a prudential judgment, and you have to look at the whole picture. Mike Pence was working to defund Planned Parenthood before it was cool. Okay, I can't say it's really all that cool now, but it is definitely something that is heard of, and it has definitely taken on great momentum. He's a true believer. He's a great articulator of the issue. It's in his DNA. It's not just something he took on under duress. Donald Trump chose him, and they had discussions about this. I just don't think you do that to yourself, if you're a guy running for president and you really just honestly wish this issue would go away. Why would you recruit Mike Pence to run alongside you? It could not be a stronger team. I kind of get tired of people saying, ""Trust me: look at all these people around me."" But all you can really do, in the end, is get solid, definite, specific commitments, compare them with hers, look at the people around, see how he handles it when he's on the stump. So far, so good, and this decision to really dig in, in the pro-life community in the battleground states, which we were doing already, but his ability to amplify -  that is enormous. It makes an enormous difference in our ability to reach the people we need to reach.Marlow said conservatives concerned with social issues have been surprisingly effective at reaching young people, even as the younger generation seems to be moving away from religious faith.""I think that's right,"" Dannenfelser agreed: Young people, and many other demographics, there is something going on. Young people, Hispanics, Democrats, and independents, who have only been communicated to by the Left on this issue, poll very, very high. Not only do they poll very high, but they indicate in the battleground states where we are, especially Hispanics and independents, that they don't like Hillary Clinton's position on abortion. Their first reaction is they can't even believe it. They can't even believe it's true that she would accept any abortion up until the hour before birth. And it really is true.Often we find that the young people marching, and the young people we hear from, they might be liberal on everything else. And they might be conservative on everything else. There is a strong libertarian streak that still leads to pro-life. So it kind of cuts across a lot of things, and that is a really healthy sign for a human rights movement because it can never feed from one pool. A successful one can't just feed from one party or one demographic. There has to come a point where it becomes universally reviled, or at least mostly reviled, by a large demographic swath of the population.Think of the child labor laws changing, or becoming into being. Abolition, civil rights - there came a point where you couldn't predict - you see a smart woman walking down the road, and ten years ago, I think most people in D.C. would say, ""Oh, yeah, she's definitely going to be pro-choice.""

ICE then ""compared that information to cars that crossed the border, hoping to find gun smugglers, according to the documents and interviews with law-enforcement officials with knowledge of the operation.""ICE faced push-back over the scans from privacy advocates.ACLU attorney Jay Stanley pointed to license plate readers as an example that ""highlights the problem with mass collection of data."" Stanley suggested ICE has taken two legal behaviors--buying a gun, crossing a border--combined them and used that combination to make people look ""inherently suspicious.""Gun Owners of America's Erich Pratt went further, saying, ""Information on law-abiding gun owners ends up getting recorded, stored, and registered, which is a violation of the 1986 Firearm Owners Protection Act and of the Second Amendment.""ICE defended their actions as ""an important and legal tool for pursuing dangerous, hard-to-track illegal activity."" At the same time, no arrests have been cited as resulting from the use of license plate readers on gun show attendees.However, John Chicgos--CEO of the company that makes the license plate readers--believes using them to target gun show attendees is ""an abuse of the technology.""AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

It went on to report, ""The same day, he headlined a fundraiser at the conference for his wife's [failed 2008 presidential] campaign.""As he hailed the virtues of ""open borders,"" Clinton told the crowd that there is no stopping this mobility and globalization:The modern world is obviously full of opportunity. ... With open borders, easy travel, easy immigration, you see these things happening all over the world. We are increasingly bound together. And with more than a trillion dollars crossing national borders every year, even if we repealed all the trade agreements in the world, you couldn't stop a lot of this globalization and mobility.Clinton's 2007 speech seemed to build upon to earlier arguments he has made, in which he's argued that ""the great mission of the 21st century is ... to move from mere interdependence [of individual nations] to integration"" and ""to create a genuine global community ... that has shared responsibilities, shared benefits and shared values.""Clinton previously explained that under this worldview, ""America has greater obligations to open our borders and to invest more in the development of poor countries.""Clinton's previous forthright declarations of support for ""open borders"" seem to undercut claims made by many in corporate media today, who insist that the Clintons do not support open borders.In his 2007 speech, Clinton elaborated on his vision for developing a ""global community""--suggesting that the creation of these transnational ""integrated communities"" would be paid for by wealthy nations, like the United States. For instance, Clinton even seemed to go as far as to suggest that wealthy nations should cover the cost of educating every child in the world:This is an unsustainable world. So in our relations with each other and within our own communities and nations, we have to go beyond an interdependence that is unequal, unstable and unsustainable. We have to build integrated communities of shared opportunities, a shared sense of responsibility for success, a genuine sense of belonging. ... The good news is, we actually know how to do a lot of this. We know what it would cost to put every child in school who's not in school, and we know what -- if the wealthy countries of the world chose to pay for it, we know that it wouldn't be aid; it would be an investment in the world's future. We also know what it would cost to build effective health systems to deal with AIDS, TB, malaria, other tropical diseases, maternal and child health. And it should be seen not as aid but as an investment in a common future.Perhaps most radically, Clinton seemed to suggest that the world ought to view its obligations to one another in the same way as would ""one nation""-- and that America ought to care for the global impoverished population in the same way that America would take care of its own impoverished U.S. citizens:When I was a young boy, barely old enough to be aware, in the late 1940s, there were still places in my home state, in Arkansas, which had a per-capita income of only half the national average. There were places in my home state that had no electricity; that had only well water, no running water; that had no sanitation; even that had no telephones. There were a few rural places that had no telephones, in my lifetime. Soon enough, all of those places were reached, those remote rural villages that were quite poor. No one thought of it as aid, because we were all in one nation. It was viewed as an investment. That's the way the world has to look at every place that needs income, education and health care. (Applause.) It's an investment, because we're all tied together. We know how to do that.Indeed, Clinton seemed to call for the development of a global identity which brings with it a ""genuine sense of belonging"" to the entire world. Clinton even seemed to suggest that if people do not come to identify themselves as citizens of the world, then all of his life's work of launching global initiatives will be nothing more than ""a pathetic failure.""""Identity. I want you to think about it,"" Clinton said. He added:Gandhi understood this. ... Ghandi knew from the depths of his soul about our common humanity. So none of us are that great, but we don't have to be that great anywhere. We are on this little bitty planet. There are -- we now know there are hundreds of billions of planets in the universe.....But the whole world's future comes down to this: How do we identify ourselves?Our whole mind, our whole being is wired toward making distinctions ... knowing the difference between men and women and tall and short, old and young. That's how brains work. But if we lose the sense that our common humanity matters more in a world where everything is related, then all the things I have said today about climate change, health care, education, everything else is totally irrelevant, and every little feeble effort I have made in my life to bring together while others are trying to tear them apart will be a pathetic failure. That is what I ask you to think about. ... What is keeping us from it is an inadequate sense of identity, a sense of belonging, that we belong together.""We certainly don't want to homogenize the world,"" Clinton added. ""But when we believe that our distinctions are so important that they obliterate the significance of our common humanity, in an interdependent world we are bound for constant trouble because we cannot escape each other.""""I think the most important challenge of the world is how we think and feel and teach our children to think and feel,"" Clinton said. ""America has been following a foreign policy in the last few years that basically says we will act alone when we can and cooperate when we have to. In an interdependent world, you have to cooperate whenever you can and act alone only when you're forced to.""The Los Angeles Times noted that during his speech, Clinton also said that he was bothered by the criticisms of outsourcing ""because it failed to acknowledge the contributions of Indians who settled in the U.S.""Clinton said:When I see all of you here -- and I read in the press all the time about -- stories about outsourcing, which bothers me, but what about all the insourcing? (Chuckles.) Look at what you did for America. Look at how many of you are here -- (applause) -- how many jobs you've created, how many people work for you. ... The prosperity enjoyed by the Indian community in the United States is evidence of what is good about the global economy.Clinton also praised the immigration policies resulting from the 1965 Ted Kennedy immigration rewrite, which lifted the immigration curbs enacted by President Calvin Coolidge and opened up American visas to the entire world.""America is so much more interesting a place today than it was 30 years ago because we have people from everywhere here,"" Clinton said. ""And we know that all these distinctions and these differences add to the search for truth and help us to push back the barriers of all the problems we have.Clinton's suggestion that the large-scale insourcing of foreign nationals represents what is good about the global economy is perhaps interesting.As Breitbart News has reported, the Clintons have extensive ties to India-based corporations, such as Tata and HCL, that import foreign workers from India into the United States on H-1B and L-1 visas to help corporations lay off and replace American workers with foreign laborers who will work for a fraction of the wage.During the heated 2008 Democratic presidential primary, Hillary Clinton came under fire for her helping India-based firms that insource low-wage foreign nationals to displace American workers.In fact, Bill Clinton's 2007 remarks to the Indian American conference came just one month after the campaign of then-Senator Barack Obama had challenged the Clintons' questionable ""personal, financial, and political ties to India""-- going so far as to identify his Democratic primary opponent as ""Hillary Clinton (D-Punjab),"" suggesting that she represents foreign nations and foreign citizens rather than her own American constituents.The line was a reference to a joke Clinton had made in which she told a group of Indian Americans that she saw herself as the elected representative of foreign citizens in the Indian region of Punjab. ""I am delighted to be the Senator from Punjab as well as from New York,"" Clinton reportedly told attendees of the 2005 Sikh American Heritage dinner event held in the U.S. Senate.A 2007 report from the Los Angeles Times highlighted Clinton's ""bind"" as she sought to ""woo"" wealthy Indian donors-- to whom she'd ""telegraph"" her longstanding support for outsourcing American jobs and insourcing foreign workers-- while at the same time launching her eventually failed effort to win over Democratic primary voters, who were skeptical of such practices.""Clinton is successfully wooing wealthy Indian Americans, many of them business leaders with close ties to their native country and an interest in protecting outsourcing laws and expanding access to worker visas,"" the Los Angeles Times wrote, noting that ""her campaign continues to telegraph -- sometimes in front of Indian American audiences -- that she sees benefits to a globalized world.""The Los Angeles Times wrote that such efforts ""signaled that Clinton, who portrays herself as a fighter for American workers, had aligned herself with Indian American business leaders and Indian companies feared by the labor movement.""""Some U.S. worker organizations say Clinton cannot claim to support American workers if she is also helping Indian outsourcing companies and proposing more worker visas,"" the Times reported.The modern world is obviously full of opportunity. ... With open borders, easy travel, easy immigration, you see these things happening all over the world. We are increasingly bound together. And with more than a trillion dollars crossing national borders every year, even if we repealed all the trade agreements in the world, you couldn't stop a lot of this globalization and mobility.This is an unsustainable world. So in our relations with each other and within our own communities and nations, we have to go beyond an interdependence that is unequal, unstable and unsustainable. We have to build integrated communities of shared opportunities, a shared sense of responsibility for success, a genuine sense of belonging. ... The good news is, we actually know how to do a lot of this. We know what it would cost to put every child in school who's not in school, and we know what -- if the wealthy countries of the world chose to pay for it, we know that it wouldn't be aid; it would be an investment in the world's future. We also know what it would cost to build effective health systems to deal with AIDS, TB, malaria, other tropical diseases, maternal and child health. And it should be seen not as aid but as an investment in a common future.When I was a young boy, barely old enough to be aware, in the late 1940s, there were still places in my home state, in Arkansas, which had a per-capita income of only half the national average. There were places in my home state that had no electricity; that had only well water, no running water; that had no sanitation; even that had no telephones. There were a few rural places that had no telephones, in my lifetime. Soon enough, all of those places were reached, those remote rural villages that were quite poor. No one thought of it as aid, because we were all in one nation. It was viewed as an investment. That's the way the world has to look at every place that needs income, education and health care. (Applause.) It's an investment, because we're all tied together. We know how to do that.Gandhi understood this. ... Ghandi knew from the depths of his soul about our common humanity. So none of us are that great, but we don't have to be that great anywhere. We are on this little bitty planet. There are -- we now know there are hundreds of billions of planets in the universe.
....
But the whole world's future comes down to this: How do we identify ourselves?
....
Our whole mind, our whole being is wired toward making distinctions ... knowing the difference between men and women and tall and short, old and young. That's how brains work. But if we lose the sense that our common humanity matters more in a world where everything is related, then all the things I have said today about climate change, health care, education, everything else is totally irrelevant, and every little feeble effort I have made in my life to bring together while others are trying to tear them apart will be a pathetic failure. That is what I ask you to think about. ... What is keeping us from it is an inadequate sense of identity, a sense of belonging, that we belong together.When I see all of you here -- and I read in the press all the time about -- stories about outsourcing, which bothers me, but what about all the insourcing? (Chuckles.) Look at what you did for America. Look at how many of you are here -- (applause) -- how many jobs you've created, how many people work for you. ...

Burke writes at the Daily Signal:King--although he conceded that there are homeschooling families who are doing well--told the audience he worries that homeschooled students aren't ""getting the range of options that are good for all kids."" According to Politico:King said he worries that 'students who are homeschooled are not getting kind of the rapid instructional experience they would get in school'--unless parents are ""very intentional about it"".King said the school experience includes building relationships with peers, teachers and mentors--elements which are difficult to achieve in homeschooling, he said, unless parents focus on it.Burke herself observes that King's statement ""assumes homeschooled students are not in school.""""As Milton Friedman famously quipped in Free to Choose, 'not all schooling is education and not all education is schooling,'"" she notes, pointing out that about 3.4 percent of children in the United States are now homeschooled, up from 1.7 percent in 1999.Reacting to King's remarks, Naomi Riall, who homeschools in North Carolina, tells Breitbart News she wonders if the education secretary has ""some master list containing this mysterious range of options.""""Perhaps I fall into the 'very intentional' category, but there are so many opportunities,"" she says, explaining:In the next two months, we're planning to visit the capitol building, attend a Native American festival, explore a rock quarry, see a theatre production, and visit the museum or park anytime we want. Oh--and there's our weekly co-op park day, where we have organized sports, friends, and free play awaiting us.If ""the school experience includes building relationships with peers, teachers and mentors,"" then the home education experience includes building relationships with family, friends, and the surrounding community. My children are not limited to engaging only children their own age. How silly would it be if after being hired at a new job, the employer separated us into work areas by age? The public education system has fabricated this fantasy that a classroom is equivalent to the real world, which only serves a student as far as graduation. Homeschoolers learn and live life in the real world. We provide an individual instruction experience, instead of ""rapid instructional experience.""Homeschooling parent Amber Shellenberger also reacted to King's comment that homeschoolers don't have a ""rapid instructional experience.""""I'm sure Mr. King meant this statement to be a negative aspect of homeschooling, but I believe this can actually be an incredible benefit,"" she tells Breitbart News, explaining:My kids and I are under very few time restraints when it comes to their schooling, so we can take our time to talk things over and actually learn rather than just memorize and move on to get a good grade on a test. I see this as building a very strong foundation for them when they are young. When they get older, they'll have a complete understanding of the educational basics so that they can build on that. Once my children have a good grasp on a subject, we move on. This can be five minutes or three days, but I don't see a point of rapid instruction if there isn't complete understanding by all students.Shellenberger says she doubts King has done much research on homeschooling:Just in our small community, we have a wonderful homeschool group that offers support, field trips, spelling bees, science fairs, dances, holiday festivities, and various tutorials. There are opportunities for music lessons, sports, theater acting, choir, art, career research and mentoring, 4H, and many, many more. Honestly, there is an equal number of opportunities for homeschoolers as there are for public schoolers, but the difference is that homeschoolers tend to have more time to get involved and take part in the extracurricular activities offered to them.Like Riall, Shellenberger also asserts that it's time to put ""the socialization myth"" to rest. She points out that homeschooled children can interact with others of a variety of ages - not simply those born in the same year. However, she also values that her children's social skills aren't ""learned by a group of kids who have no social skills of their own, but by my husband and I - two adults who can guide them and teach them social norms, good habits, manners, and conflict resolution.""""In this kind of safe environment, I've also noticed that my kids can each be themselves and aren't swayed by the influence of their peers,"" she adds. ""They can build relationships with others by being themselves and sharing their interests rather than being afraid that someone will criticize them for being different. This is probably my favorite thing about homeschooling my kids!""Wisconsin homeschooling parent Sara Lehman says King's remarks suggest he presumes he knows what's best ""for all kids.""""That's exactly the problem with the state of government schools,"" she tells Breitbart News. ""What's also ironic is that his statement is in direct contradiction to why we choose to homeschool. We didn't want 'rapid (one size fits all) instruction' meant to push kids along regardless if they were actually gaining knowledge.""""The quality of public education is a joke and I have to believe that these politicians know this,"" Lehman continues further:Why else would their main argument against homeschooling be, continuously, about the ""social"" aspect? My children are interacting with a broader range of people - a broader age range of children. They are actually getting a broader range of education than in public school as well. King's argument about that is debunked easily. Does not each school have a list of classes that students get to choose from? Based on funding, schools could have few options or many. Homeschoolers, however, are not restricted at all! Our options are limitless. Our children are getting a well- rounded education that focuses on learning - not grading, testing, and ""socializing."" For many parents, the social aspect of government schooling is exactly what they don't want! In short, they have seen ""the village,"" and don't want it raising their children.However, Karen Braun - a Michigan homeschooling mom of six - says that while homeschoolers may be tempted to reflexively react to King's comments with the response that they actually have the ""most options,"" she sees a looming threat in the education secretary's remarks.""He is actually saying something I have been talking about for quite a while,"" she tells Breitbart News, explaining:Understanding his statement as it pertains to the transformation in education currently taking place is essential. This isn't as much about the parent being ""intentional"" as we might think of it, but more as the student being a part of the system with the intent of ""career readiness"". Those that are part of the system have the range of options; those that aren't, do not. The reference for King's remarks is the competency-based system of education.Braun warns homeschoolers ""will have limited options in a competency-based education system - and that is by design.""She continues:This is a system based on what is ""earned,"" not what is learned. It's Pokemon Go! for all learners. Students learn to earn ""digital badges"" that allow them to advance higher in the system. Those that play their game advance, and those that don't, won't.Homeschoolers don't play the feds' game, align to their standards, or compete for badges. Homeschoolers are driven by a desire to develop the mind and hearts of their children, not develop skilled workers.Braun cites the example of a Michigan homeschooling student who was invited to attend the upcoming homecoming dance in the Wayne-Westland Community school district. A report last week at Michigan Capitol Confidential, however, says the school district responded with its policy that only homeschooled students coming from an ""accredited"" homeschool may attend dances within the district.""That would effectively ban homeschoolers from attending dances held by the district since homeschoolers have no reason to be accredited and the state doesn't require it,"" says the report.""This is a concrete example of 'limited' options based on accreditation,"" says Braun - who was quoted in the news report. ""If the state can restrict homeschoolers from a dance based on accreditation, they can restrict or limit them elsewhere.""Like Braun, Wisconsin homeschooling parent Tina Hollenbeck also responds to the fact that the U.S. education chief is making a judgment about homeschooling - a clear violation, she says, of the Constitution.""What is really irksome is that he feels he has a right to an opinion at all,"" she tells Breitbart News. ""The bottom-line fact is that his job, and the very existence of the Department of Education, violates the 10th Amendment, which means that anything he says about any form of schooling is actually illegitimate.""Hollenbeck asserts King was ""grossly out of line to express any public opinion about homeschooling - which falls far out of the realm of anything for which he is ostensibly responsible.""""The focus shouldn't be on arguing against his ignorance,"" she asserts. ""Instead, it should be on pointing out that he has irresponsibly spoken in an official capacity about something over which he has absolutely no authority.""King--although he conceded that there are homeschooling families who are doing well--told the audience he worries that homeschooled students aren't ""getting the range of options that are good for all kids."" According to Politico:
King said he worries that 'students who are homeschooled are not getting kind of the rapid instructional experience they would get in school'--unless parents are ""very intentional about it"".
King said the school experience includes building relationships with peers, teachers and mentors--elements which are difficult to achieve in homeschooling, he said, unless parents focus on it.In the next two months, we're planning to visit the capitol building, attend a Native American festival, explore a rock quarry, see a theatre production, and visit the museum or park anytime we want.

It's called fraud. It's also called bait and switch. They are trying to distract you from the real crimes committed by Hillary Clinton.They know Clinton is a criminal. They know she and her scheming husband Bill have committed terrible crimes against the American people. They know the Clinton Foundation is a charity scam. They know almost none of the money collected ever goes to charity. Any one of us running a charity scam like this would be in prison.They know that the Clinton Foundation is basically a mafia extortion scheme set up to extort bribes from foreign leaders, foreign companies and foreign countries. They know Hillary put the Secretary of State's office up for sale to the highest bidders. They know she took those bribes disguised as ""donations"" and repaid the ""donors"" with access to government awards, contracts and sweetheart deals. She took in billions of dollars, in a foundation in her name, then used our taxpayer dollars to reward the criminals buying access.Hillary was running the CCC- the Clinton Crime Cartel.Give Hillary credit. This scheme was more audacious than any mafia family has ever dreamed of. And more lucrative than even the mafia's favorite products- drugs, booze, prostitution or pornography. Hillary is the new role model for the Gambinos.Hillary's scam was like printing money. No risk. Pay no taxes on the billions she collected- because it's a ""charity."" Use the money for fancy dinners, 5-star hotels, private jets, big salaries and even penthouses for Chelsea Clinton. And pay no expenses either- because the payoff for the bribe is paid by taxpayers.The New York Times doesn't care. They don't have any interest in investigating or reporting on the CCC- The Clinton Crime Cartel.They are owned lock, stock and barrel by the CCC. They need Hillary in the White House. Who knows what favors they've been promised to keep the spotlight off Hillary's serious crimes. Her crimes certainly include fraud, extortion, theft of taxpayer money, running a charity scam and income tax evasion.And don't forget purposely erasing 32,000 emails after hearing the FBI demanded to see them. You can bet those emails were about The Clinton Foundation and The Clinton Crime Cartel.So the New York Times needed a cover-up to fool and distract the voters. They chose Donald Trump's taxes. Their goal was to drown out Hillary's real crimes by accusing Trump of LEGALLY reducing his taxes according to the letter of the law. The New York Times wants you to believe following tax law and LEGALLY reducing your taxes is a crime.But what Hillary did...extorting bribes...selling out the country...selling the Secretary of State's office...stealing our taxpayer money...and running ac charity scam...none of that should be an issue. ""Move along sir...nothing to see here.""Back to Trump's taxes. The only possible tax issue is, of course, if a candidate cheats on his taxes. Donald Trump has been audited by the IRS for 20 years in a row. Not once has he ever been accused of cheating on his taxes. If he'd EVER had one irregularity, it would have been leaked by Obama and Hillary's many friends in high places at the IRS.You know, the same IRS agents who tried to destroy the Tea Party movement and conservative critics of Obama (like me). By the way, the New York Times never investigated the massive IRS scandal involving political targeting, intimidation and persecution. I have direct evidence obtained by Judicial Watch that the IRS targeted me for my political beliefs. But The New York Times had no interest. ""Move along sir...nothing to see here.""Since there has NEVER been even a hint of Trump cheating on his taxes, the desperate New York Times is trying to make LEGAL tax reduction strategies, advised by the smartest tax lawyers in America, into a crime. Donald Trump LEGALLY took advantage of every tax deduction offered by the tax system...and LEGALLY applied tax losses to future gains.Every American...Republican or Democrat...has a right to take legal deductions and to apply and carry forward tax losses against tax gains. The New York Times knows this.Last I checked if you lose a billion dollars in real estate (or stocks, or business investment)...then you make a billion...you owe zero. That's a wash for tax purposes. Every businessman friend I've got has used the same math...and same LEGAL tax reduction strategy.What's the crime? There is none.But extorting $2 billion at the Clinton Foundation from foreign countries and foreign companies through ""donations"" and $250,000 speaker fees...putting the State Department up for sale...and giving out billions in contracts and awards to the very people that donated to you...is a true crime. What the Clintons did is pure fraud upon America and the taxpayers.LEGALLY taking tax deductions based on business or real estate losses to LEGALLY reduce your taxes is not only kosher...and legal...but it's as American as apple pie.Interesting that The New York Times ignores the real crime...and tries to make LEGAL tax reduction strategies a crime.This is called fraud. This is also called ""bait and switch.""No worries. Soon Julian Assange of Wikileaks may show the world evidence of Hillary Clinton's crimes against America and the American people. That may be coming. Clinton's campaign will be blown to smithereens. She'll have a better chance of spending time in the Big House than the White House.Oh, one more thing. It turns out Hillary Clinton (in 2015) and the New York Times (in 2014) both used the same legal tax reduction strategy as Donald Trump to avoid paying any taxes.It turns out these two gray old ladies are birds of a feather- frauds, liars, scam artists and hypocrites too.SIGN UP"	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) told CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday that his supporters were, in fact, ""living in their parents' basements,"" as his former rival, Hillary Clinton, had said at a secretly-recorded fundraiser in February.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIt was the latest betrayal in Sanders' continuing capitulation to the Clinton machine, which began with the first Democratic primary debate in Las Vegas last October, and became impossible to ignore at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July.The first days of the convention were marked by spirited protests by Sanders supporters from the floor of the Wells Fargo Arena. Supporters were particularly outraged at Clinton, given the revelations by Wikileaks that the Democratic National Committee had colluded with the Clinton campaign to deny Sanders a fair chance at winning the nomination.But even as party officials literally turned out the lights on Sanders delegates to drown them out, Sanders did nothing in their defense.Instead, Sanders did Clinton the honor of personally handing her Vermont's delegates, even as hundreds of his delegates walked out of the hall in protest. Still, Sanders supporters were not ready to blame him for what had happened. At private meetings between the delegates and their candidate, there were hugs and tears, but few questions about why Sanders could have allowed millions of voters to believe in his promised ""political revolution"" when he had no intention of leading one.Though he is technically ""independent,"" Sanders has proved he is a Party man. There is apparently no amount of corruption by Hillary Clinton that would arouse his condemnation, and no insult to his supporters that would provoke him to rise to their defense. His ""political revolution"" was little more than a vanity project, and possibly an AstroTurf operation designed to lure otherwise discouraged Democrats back into the voting booth.Sanders' new vacation home does not appear to have a basement.SIGN UP"	['Sanders', 'Clinton']	[]

Christian Adams, the former Department of Justice lawyer, and now the president of the Public Interest Legal Foundation. ""Even worse than doing nothing about it, they are trying to cover it up,"" he told Breitbart News.Even small amounts of illegal voting can make a decisive difference -- Democratic Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring defeated Republican Mark Obenshain in 2013 by a mere 165 votes out of 2.2 million votes cast.But ""in the eight [out of 130-plus] jurisdictions that provided us with lists of aliens recently removed from their voter rolls, we discovered that 31 non-citizens had cast a total of 186 votes between 2005 and 2015,"" said the report, given first to Breitbart News. ""This is just a fraction of the aliens caught in just eight counties in a state with over 130 counties,"" Adams said. ""Even with such a small sample, the number of aliens who got on the voter rolls is staggering. The aliens are casting ballots in a state where elections have been decided by a few hundred votes.""The new report is a partnership of the Virginia Voters Alliance and the Public Interest Legal Foundation, and it details how at least 1,046 non-citizens were allowed to vote based on official voting records, he said.State-wide, ""the problem is most certainly exponentially worse [than seen in the eight localities] because we have no data regarding aliens on the registration rolls for the other 125 Virginia localities,"" the report said. ""When the voting history of this small sample of alien registrants is examined, nearly 200 verified ballots were cast before they were removed from the rolls. Each one of them is likely a felony.""The authors highlighted the role played by Edgardo Cortes, the commissioner of the commonwealth's department of elections.Before his appointment by Democratic Gov. Terence McAuliffe, Cortes was a left-wing operative of Virginia Voting Rights Restoration Campaign, within the left-wing Advancement Project. The project was funded and supported by George Soros, through his Tides Foundation and Open Society Foundations.The report makes the direct charge: ""At the instruction of Commissioner Cortes, local election officials refused to provide us with records showing the voting history of non-citizens removed from registration lists.Previous to McAuliffe taking office in 2014, state officials had used the federal Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements database, it is also known as the SAVE database, to detect and remove aliens from the voting rolls, the report said.One of the top priorities of the Soros' Advancement Project is to stop the use of SAVE to purge voter lists.Adams, who is the author of the book Injustice: Exposing the racial agenda of the Obama Justice Department, told Breitbart News Virginia state officials have willfully ignored the evidence of large-scale voter fraud.""The state Board of Elections, which has a 2-to-1 Democrat majority told local election officials to ignore our investigation, even though federal law gives PILF the right to inspect documents listing the aliens who were quietly removed from the rolls,"" he said.The report points to the federal 1993 National Voter Registration Act, known by its ""Motor Voter"" moniker, which compelled states to register as a voter anyone who presents a driver's license and checks a box attesting that they are an American citizen. The law does not require any other evidence, and in several states, such as Alabama, Georgia and Kansas, the Department of Justice and or left-wing operatives have sought to block efforts to tighten citizenship verification.But the Motor Voter law also requires officials to maintain records and to strip ineligible voters from the rolls. So the voters' alliance asked officials for copies of voters' records to gauge their eligibility.In January, the Virginia Voters Alliance requested City of Alexandria registrar Anna Leider to produce voter records, but Leider refused.In April, the Public Interest Legal Foundation, on behalf of VVA and Alexandria citizen David Norcross, filed suit in federal court. When the case came to the courtroom, Leider promised the court she would allow VVA and Norcross to inspect her records-an inspection, which revealed hundreds of non-citizens on the voter rolls. But, Leider's cooperation ended there, as she stopped the VVA representatives from making a photocopy of the list, according to the report's authors.Eight months later, Leider's lawyer produced a list of just 70 aliens her office had removed from the rolls, according to the report.Following this confirmation, VVA and PILF made similiar requests to 19 of the commonwealth's cities and counties: Arlington, Albemarle, Bedford, Chesterfield, Fairfax City, Fauquier, Frederick, Falls Church,  Loudon, Hampton, Hanover, James City, Lancaster, Manassas, Prince William, Roanoke, Stafford, Rappahannock and York.Election officials at Prince William County provided VVA with the names of 433 non-citizens, who had been registered to vote in the county, but had been later removed, the report said.Barbara Gunter, the general registrar of Bedford County, which has roughly 60,000 voting age citizens, produced at list of 35 names of illegal voters on the rolls. She also gave up the names of additional 54 voters who were sent notices that they need to validate their eligibility. But soon after her response to VVA and PILF, Gunter called PILF requesting that they destroy the list. She asked for the list to be destroyed because Cortes, the state elections commissioner, claimed she violated the federal Drivers Privacy Protection Act.This process was repeated in Roanoke County, which produced a list 22 illegal voters. Then the county's General Registrar Judith Stokes emailed PILF to request the destruction of the list upon the guidance of Cortes, according to the report.Following Roanoke's email, all of the other 17 jurisdictions with pending requests for voter records contacted VVA and PILF to say that Cortes told them not to honor the requests, each citing concerns for driver privacy, according to the report.The report says the coverup was exposed when Cortes took his next step, which insist that all requests of voter records would be processed through his state office. Tn his own correspondence with VVA and PILF, the commissioner said his consolidation was meant to relieve local offices of the administrative burden and to ensure that individual's privacy concerns were addressed.Cortes final offer to VVA and PILF is that he will promise to provide some information, but nothing relating to illegal voters and the purging of illegal voters.Adams told Breitbart News, the abuses and cover up in Virginia is just the tip of the iceberg, not only in Virginia, but across the country.The voting rights attorney said the VVA and PILF groups did their job by naming names, by citing the actions and inaction, of state and local election officials.It is important to remember that the report describes violations of state and federal laws that have yet to be addressed by state and federal law enforcement, he said.""Soros fueled groups like the NAACP, Democrats and Advancement Project are in court now opposing citizenship verification measures,"" he said.For years the Left has dismissed suspicions that non-citizens are voting, he said. ""Now, we know why,"" the lawyer said.""When an alien registers to vote, it is a felony,"" Adams said. ""When an alien votes, it is multiple felonies. DOJ under Obama has stopped enforcing this law. We name the names of the registered voters removed from the rolls for citizenship problems.  Will DOJ prosecute any of them?""SIGN UP"	['McAuliffe', 'Obama', 'Adams', 'Norcross']	[]

Trump, the Republican nominee for president, over the course of two events just added to his campaign schedule on Monday in the all-important battleground state of Colorado. SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERCompared with Hillary Clinton, his rival and the Democratic nominee for president who has all but abandoned the state as Trump takes the lead in polling, that's a significant amount. Clinton had trouble filling a small venue the last time she was in Colorado in early August.""The last time Hillary Clinton was in Colorado was in early August,"" Trump's Colorado state director Patrick Davis told Breitbart News on Sunday night. ""She had trouble filling a high school auditorium in Commerce City. We expect thousands of people in Pueblo and tens of thousands in Loveland tomorrow.""Colorado's nine electoral votes make it one of the most critical battleground states, and the last time a Republican won the state in the presidential election was George W. Bush in both 2000 and 2004. Barack Obama, the outgoing current Democratic president, won in both 2008 and 2012, defeating John McCain and Mitt Romney in those respective contests.Trump will appear at 3 p.m. Mountain Time in Pueblo, about two hours south of Denver, and then at 6 p.m. Mountain Time in Loveland, about an hour north of Denver. While most in the legacy establishment media refuse to cover the people who come out to Trump rallies, Breitbart News will be on the ground to provide live coverage with photographs and videos with the crowd.""If you go to a Trump rally, you see it,"" Davis told Breitbart News about the clear enthusiasm gap that exists between Trump's energetic campaign rallies and Clinton's boring speech events. ""You feel it. It's more rock concert than it is political rally.""Trump, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average, has taken a slight lead in Colorado over Clinton of a half a percent with momentum at his back. The latest Breitbart News Network/Gravis Marketing survey from Colorado has Trump up four points over Clinton, just outside the survey's margin of error. Davis said it's a combination of developments that have led to Clinton's drop off in support in Colorado, and Trump's surge: She's not in the state, her campaign and the Democrats aren't airing television ads, and staff for Clinton and the Democrats are rushing out of Colorado as fast as they can. Mix that together with Trump's appeal on economic issues, immigration, the Iran deal, and healthcare policy, and you've got a winning campaign in Colorado.""I think it's two things: One is the strength of his message about the economy and jobs -- Colorado's economy is actually humming along pretty well,"" Davis said:I think his message to the voters of Colorado is ""you like what you got now? Just wait until I become president. It will be rocking."" The other thing that's helping is he's been here quite a bit. He's spending money here. We're on television here. We have a very good sized field staff and ground game going on here. You go to even a small Trump rally in a local field office, 200 or 300 people will show up -- these are people you don't know. But there's a lot of energy in Colorado. On the other side of the fence, Hillary's campaign is all but dead here. She's not on television. You don't see phone banks filled. Actually, you see some staff leaving the state on the Democratic side. It does feel like they've abandoned Colorado.When told of how the campaign of GOP senatorial nominee Darryl Glenn informed Breitbart News of the fact that the Iran deal, Obamacare, and immigration are frustrations voters here have with the status quo in Washington, D.C., Davis said: ""They're right on.""Glenn, a fellow outsider like Trump who's also seeing a surge in polling in the state as he runs against incumbent Democrat Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO), told Breitbart News in his own exclusive interview that he thinks this is an outsider's year. ""The bottom line is whether it's the establishment or whatever, people are really tired of politicians saying one thing to get elected and then selling out to special interest groups and really not representing people,"" Glenn said in the interview, the full version of which is forthcoming.With regard to Obamacare specifically, Davis said, Coloradans are seeing their premiums go up and their plans go away. ""On Obamacare, the problem in Colorado is that people are seeing their policies go away -- be taken away -- they're losing their coverage. And their premiums are skyrocketing in Colorado,"" Davis said. ""So, people are being forced into Obamacare and they don't have any choices. So the quality of care, the quality of insurance, is going down.""Davis added that the Department of Veterans Affairs, ""and how we treat our veterans,"" is certainly ""resonating here.""""We have a couple big high profile VA clinics here, one being in Aurora in Congressman Coffman's district that is a complete unmitigated disaster,"" Davis said:The VA has completely screwed that up--it's way over budget and it's still not finished. That is the poster child of the dysfunction at the VA, and it's right here in Colorado. If you're a veteran in Colorado and looking for healthcare, in some cases you wait for months. We don't have enough good doctors in the VA system to put our veterans in front of. Mr. Trump was here at the beginning of September and he proposed rolling out a program in Colorado Springs -- or in Colorado in general -- where we would give veterans a card and say ""go find a doctor that will see you and can help you and we will pay for it,"" not keeping them tied into the VA system. Mr. Trump said he wanted to roll out that plan here in Colorado first, and that was widely well and positively received.Trump's surge in the polls in Colorado is coinciding with some of the most vicious attacks that the Hillary Clinton campaign -- and their allies in the legacy and establishment media in Washington, D.C., and in New York City -- have levied against the businessman. Given the nature of Colorado voters -- free-thinking and independent-minded with a disdain for elitists telling them how to think -- that doesn't surprise Davis one bit. ""The people of Colorado, all across the board -- all types of voters, Republicans, Democrats, independents, libertarians, socialists, even Green Party -- they are not cheap,"" Davis said:We like to think for ourselves. We have a healthy suspicion of the mainstream media in Colorado and I think that's why you see people like Donald Trump doing very well here, because he treats individuals -- voters of all types -- like individuals. He doesn't treat people like ""African Americans"" and ""Hispanic Americans"" -- he treats them like Americans. And he wants them to prosper individually and that message comes through loud and clear. I think people are open to listening to what Mr. Trump has to say here, not what is being said in the mainstream media.Davis also predicted that Trump will intensify his efforts to reach out to Hispanic voters in the coming days.""We're going to hear a lot in the next couple of days about Mr. Trump's appeal to Hispanic Americans, and Hispanics in Colorado,"" Davis said: In my experience, in the past couple of months -- particularly after Trump's speech in Phoenix about immigration -- the Hispanics in Colorado were telling me and were telling the campaign that he had given them some hope that the doorway wasn't closed for them to have a say in the immigration policy in a Trump administration. They took his speech as the beginning of conversation, not the closing of a door, and I think you're going to hear more of that in the coming days.I think his message to the voters of Colorado is ""you like what you got now? Just wait until I become president. It will be rocking."" The other thing that's helping is he's been here quite a bit. He's spending money here. We're on television here.

Davis said it's a combination of developments that have led to Clinton's drop off in support in Colorado, and Trump's surge: She's not in the state, her campaign and the Democrats aren't airing television ads, and staff for Clinton and the Democrats are rushing out of Colorado as fast as they can. Mix that together with Trump's appeal on economic issues, immigration, the Iran deal, and healthcare policy, and you've got a winning campaign in Colorado.""I think it's two things: One is the strength of his message about the economy and jobs -- Colorado's economy is actually humming along pretty well,"" Davis said:When told of how the campaign of GOP senatorial nominee Darryl Glenn informed Breitbart News of the fact that the Iran deal, Obamacare, and immigration are frustrations voters here have with the status quo in Washington, D.C., Davis said: ""They're right on.""Glenn, a fellow outsider like Trump who's also seeing a surge in polling in the state as he runs against incumbent Democrat Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO), told Breitbart News in his own exclusive interview that he thinks this is an outsider's year. ""The bottom line is whether it's the establishment or whatever, people are really tired of politicians saying one thing to get elected and then selling out to special interest groups and really not representing people,"" Glenn said in the interview, the full version of which is forthcoming.With regard to Obamacare specifically, Davis said, Coloradans are seeing their premiums go up and their plans go away. ""On Obamacare, the problem in Colorado is that people are seeing their policies go away -- be taken away -- they're losing their coverage. And their premiums are skyrocketing in Colorado,"" Davis said. ""So, people are being forced into Obamacare and they don't have any choices. So the quality of care, the quality of insurance, is going down.""Davis added that the Department of Veterans Affairs, ""and how we treat our veterans,"" is certainly ""resonating here.""""We have a couple big high profile VA clinics here, one being in Aurora in Congressman Coffman's district that is a complete unmitigated disaster,"" Davis said:Trump's surge in the polls in Colorado is coinciding with some of the most vicious attacks that the Hillary Clinton campaign -- and their allies in the legacy and establishment media in Washington, D.C., and in New York City -- have levied against the businessman. Given the nature of Colorado voters -- free-thinking and independent-minded with a disdain for elitists telling them how to think -- that doesn't surprise Davis one bit. ""The people of Colorado, all across the board -- all types of voters, Republicans, Democrats, independents, libertarians, socialists, even Green Party -- they are not cheap,"" Davis said:Davis also predicted that Trump will intensify his efforts to reach out to Hispanic voters in the coming days.""We're going to hear a lot in the next couple of days about Mr. Trump's appeal to Hispanic Americans, and Hispanics in Colorado,"" Davis said: "	['Romney', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Bennet', 'McCain']	['healthcare']

The government doesn't pay net refunds when business owners lose money, but it lets taxpayers use those losses to smooth their tax payments as they make money. That reflects the fact that ""the natural business cycle of a taxpayer may exceed 12 months,"" according to a congressional report.Typically, for federal returns, such net operating losses can be carried backward for two years to offset past income and then kept on a taxpayer's books for 20 years, though Mr. Trump's losses could only qualify for a 15-year carryforward under the law at the time.The Clinton campaign has hammered Trump on his unreleased tax returns. When pundits on cable news now refer to the ""Taxes"" issue, they're usually talking about Trump's personal ""taxes"" issue, not the taxes paid by American voters.But the Zerohedge blog first noticed something that could undercut Clinton's ability to hit Trump on his ""net operating losses.""Clinton's 2015 tax returns reveal that Hillary Clinton also reported capital gains losses in order to lessen her tax burden through a ""carryover.""Page 17 of the tax returns show ""Capital Gains and Losses"" for ""WILLIAM J CLINTON & HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON.""The Clintons reported a ""Long-term capital loss carryover"" of $699,540.Thus, the Clintons reported a ""Net long-term capital gain or (loss)"" of ""-699,540.""Clinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill did not immediately return Breitbart News's request for comment.The tax treatment of losses, bound to become a subject of national debate, is a typically noncontroversial feature of the income-tax system.

There was the Democratic National Committee's attempt to attack Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who is Jewish, over his religion. There is Hillary Clinton's embrace of the Black Lives Matter movement, whose platform accuses Israel of ""genocide"" -- an antisemitic claim that turns the victims of the Holocaust into its perpetrators. And there is Clinton's efforts to promote the writings of Max Blumenthal, an antisemite who is the son of her close associate, Sydney Blumenthal.On a policy level, Clinton backs the disastrous Iran deal, which has sent billions of dollars -- including ransom money -- to a regime that not only promotes Holocaust denial and the hatred of Jews, but which continues to target Jews around the world in terror attacks. And as First Lady, she embraced Yasser Arafat's wife as the latter accused Israel of using poison gas to kill Palestinian women and children. As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton faithfully carried out President Barack Obama's policy of ""distance"" from Israel, whose latest snub involved ""correcting"" a White House press release about Shimon Peres's funeral to deny that Jerusalem is, in fact, the capital of Israel.That is not a record of standing up to antisemitism. On the contrary, Clinton has encouraged it.Wofford's case rests entirely on the claim that there are antisemites who support Trump. He ignores the antisemitism among Clinton's supporters.Lena Dunham, for one, published an article last year titled: ""Dog or Jewish Boyfriend? A Quiz."" The father of the Orlando terrorist turned up behind Clinton at a recent rally in Florida. And it is no accident that pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel activists were in full force at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. They know their party.""I support Palestinian human rights"" - protest signs inside the arena at #DNCinPHL pic.twitter.com/h9D40XoXzo-- Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) July 25, 2016The Politico article treats antisemitism as if it were a new phenomenon, emerging in the 2016 campaign. Has Wofford been on a college campus recently? Antisemitism has been exploding, primarily as a by-product of vicious anti-Israel campaigns.At the University of California Davis last year, Muslim students taunted Jewish students with shouts of ""Allahu akbar"" at a student government meeting. Later, swastikas were found spray-painted on a Jewish fraternity. That was long before Trump.StandWithUs via FacebookThere is certainly antisemitism on the right -- largely online, tweeted by anonymous trolls. The antisemitism on the left is real and concrete.But Democrats show little interest in stopping it; indeed, their primary concern is how best to turn the vehement activists of the anti-Israel, antisemitic far-left into volunteers and voters.Not a word of that made its way into Politico's story, which is best described as a partisan smear -- and an attempt to cover up the real nature of antisemitism in America today.Joel B.

For my 2005 book The Truth About Hillary, I interviewed Hillary's grammar school classmate, Jim Yrigoyen, who told me the story of being ordered by Hillary to guard a warren of baby rabbits, and not give any of them away to neighborhood boys. When he did, recalled Yrigoyen, ""Hillary hauled off and punched me in the nose.""She's been using people as punching bags ever since. Back in 1974, when 26-year-old Hillary worked for Bernard Nussbaum, a senior member of the House of Representatives Watergate Committee, she blew up after Nussbaum expressed doubts that Hillary's 28-year-old boyfriend, Bill Clinton, would one day become president.""She looks at me and says, 'You don't know a goddam thing you're talking about',"" Nussbaum recalled. ""'You're a blank. You're a blank.' She used strong curse words that she uses. She started bawling me out.... She walks out and slams the door on me.""For as long as her friends have known her--going back to her days at Wellesley College in the 1960s-- Hillary has sworn like a drunken sailor. Here are some choice examples from well-researched books on Hillary's vulgar mouth:According to an oral history of the Clinton presidency conducted by the University of Virginia's Miller Center, Hillary was impossible to work for when she was first lady.""She just let everybody have it,"" said Leon Panetta, who served as Bill Clinton's chief of staff. Panetta recalled an aide telling him, ""The first lady just tore everybody a new ass--e.""Joan Baggett, who served as assistant to President Clinton for political affairs, said aides were afraid to take on Hillary even when she was wrong.""She would blow up over something that she misinterpreted,"" Baggett said. ""I remember one time in one of these meetings where she was blowing up about [Bill Clinton's] staff and how we were all incompetent and he was having to be the mechanic and drive the car and do everything that we weren't capable of.""Fast forward to the 2016 presidential campaign, and Hillary is still at it--still blowing up at the least provocation.""She has had screaming, child-like tantrums that have left staff members in tears and unable to work,"" one of her campaign workers told me. ""People have walked out from her Brooklyn campaign office and while they were on the campaign trail with her. At one point recently, she was berating a low-level campaign worker for making a scheduling mistake. The girl had the nerve to walk away from her, so Hillary grabbed her arm and twisted it.""Sometimes, when she gets worked up, Hillary grabs a handful of her hair and in an odd mannerism that her friends describe, she yanks at the hair so hard that it looks as though she is trying to pull it out.Did you ever hear of Donald Trump trying to pull out his hair?Did you ever hear of Donald Trump screaming at campaign workers?Did you ever hear of Donald Trump physically attacking someone?Did you ever hear of Donald Trump using curse words in practically every sentence?Hillary does all those things.Does that sound like a woman who has the temperament to be president of the United States?SIGN UP"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

The illegal alien had been previously deported on October 1, 2010 and has now been charged with illegal re-entry.Juan Navarro Rios, 43, a three-time previously deported illegal alien was arrested for what was described as a crime ""rampage."" CBS described Rios as ""a murderer, carjacker and kidnapper whose reign of terror spanned at least from the city of Dallas to just north of Austin.""During his ""reign of terror,"" Rios allegedly shot to death a 23-year-old man in his vehicle on the shoulder of Texas State Highway Spur 408, he then ""opened fire on at least two other vehicles."" Later that evening, Rios allegedly drove up next to Welton Betts, 44, as he was pumping gas at a Texaco gas station. He allegedly shot and killed Betts, forced Betts' wife out of the car and stole the vehicle. Betts, a black American who had fallen in love and married his high school sweetheart and raised a family with her, has been described as ""a typical Texan: he loved God, his family, hard work, the Cowboys, and his pickup truck.""Reports note that Rios also allegedly ""broke into a home, took the keys to a Lexus, and drove it to Georgetown, Texas, where it was found abandoned. He is also believed to have kidnapped a man at gunpoint Monday morning and then trying to force him to withdraw money from an ATM. Rios set fire to his sister's apartment in Georgetown, broke through a wall into a neighbor's apartment, and tried to flee before being captured. He had a gun nearby.""According to reports, Rios had multiple criminal charges in Williamson County, including felony possession of a controlled substance and burglary of a vehicle.ABC's WFAA reports that Rios ""had so many aliases--at least eight by last count--that police aren't even sure of his real name... Records also revealed that he had crossed the U.S.-Mexico border at least 35 times, using a passport with a fake name.""Reports note that the illegal criminal alien was well-known in his Hispanic community. ""In a largely Spanish-speaking neighborhood in southern Dallas, everybody knew Juan Navarro Rios as 'flaco' [Spanish for 'skinny'].""Two Mexican nationals, 23-year-old Fernando Limon and 28-year-old Ramiro Limon, were arrested and are facing four counts of rape of a child.

It was originally reported Cetin was in the country as a lawful permanent resident, but not a U.S. citizen. However, after documentation surfaced showing he had registered to vote in 2014 and had in fact voted in three elections, new reports now indicate Cetin is a naturalized U.S. citizen.

Burrows decided to record the gang rape on video.Burrows came to the U.S. when he was 12 years old and promptly joined a gang. Even still, the government rewarded him with lawful permanent resident status.The 2012 gang rape was not Burrows' first run-in with the law. In 2011, he was charged with theft, but a judge was apparently lenient with him and reportedly spared him jail time, allowing him to go back on the streets and eventually take part in a gang rape the following year.Reports note that the gang rape might never have come to light if one of Burrows' fellow gang members hadn't bragged about the rape to his co-worker and showed him the ""funny"" video recording of the rape, which he had saved on his cellphone. The Washington Post reports that on the 35-minute audio recording of the rape, Burrows can be heard ""like a coach"" giving instructions to the men on how to rape the girl. ""The victim could be heard screaming and saying in slurred speech to stop,"" the Post writes. ""As the recording continues, Burrows could be heard giving instructions, at one point asking, 'Who's next?'""During a six-day operation, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested 47 illegal aliens from the Washington D.C. and Virginia area who had previously been convicted of crimes.

The company reported a federal income tax expense of $1 billion, but the tax bill became a credit due to a tax break the company got in connection with General Motors Europe.The U.S. Treasury recently released a set of guidelines that were intended to crack down on companies that try to reduce their tax bills by merging with foreign companies, CNN Money reported.SIGN UP	[]	[]
