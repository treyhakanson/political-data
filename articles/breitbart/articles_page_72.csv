But now the reality has changed; Assad again announced that he would liberate all of Syria, the Russian missiles and Navy continued to swarm toward Syria and Moscow has warned Washington against any attempt to harm the Syrian regime, saying that any American military action will lead to a crisis in the entire region.""The website added that, ""What's funny is that Putin knows that the Obama administration won't do anything militarily, but he insisted on increasing his threats against Washington in order to show that Russia is returning to its role as the polar opposite in the Middle East, and as many are saying in the U.S., Putin is taking advantage of the days left to the lame duck in the White House to help Assad rehabilitate his regime and to return more territories under his control to reduce the opposition that will still stand for the next President.""The site noted that Putin's window of opportunity will remain open until next March, when the next administration will begin to take action:""And within these five months, Putin will try to create a reality that matches his calculations in Syria and it is clear to him that the next administration will take a much tougher stance against the Kremlin and against the Syrian regime and that the policy of inaction that Obama adopted, claiming that Russia and Iran would be left to sink in the bloody mire of Syria.""

They argue the Core's insistence that K-12 English and math standards focus on skills that can transfer easily to current-day work situations abandons a primary goal of Catholic education: to help students develop their spirituality and ethical principles.""[T]he Common Core is undoubtedly and unacceptably workforce-oriented, thereby misinforming student character and impoverishing academic content,"" the authors write. ""Catholic schools typically embrace character education and rely heavily on language arts, history, and religion curricula as crucial means to educate and inspire students toward a virtuous life. Adopting the new standards may seriously compromise this essential effort.""The authors also document how the Common Core's developers view ""workforce development"" as ""the proper goal of education,"" one that is considered primary by the political supporters of the standards.They continue:The workforce educational model currently being promoted by the government relies heavily on the concept of training. It aims to train students in certain skills of information-processing and mathematical abilities that transfer rather directly to today's world of work. Training consists of learning how to accomplish a task and ""getting the job done."" At the heart of the Common Core agenda is a century-old dream of Progressive educators to redirect education's mission away from engaging the young in the best of human thought and focusing instead on preparation for ""real life."" While a reasonable but quite secondary goal, workforce-development is dwarfed by Catholic schools' transcendent goals of human excellence, spiritual transformation, and preparation for ""the next life"" as well.In 2013, NCEA was awarded $100,007 by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation - the primary source of private funding for the promotion of the Common Core standards - to encourage Catholic schools in the adoption of the Common Core standards. Two years later, NCEA drew further outrage for inviting Common Core ""architect"" David Coleman to serve as the keynote speaker for the organization's annual convention.Also in 2013, with approximately 100 out of 195 Catholic dioceses in the United States embracing Common Core for its schools, more than 130 Catholic scholars sent a letter to the U.S. Catholic bishops requesting that they abandon any implementation of the Common Core standards.The letter read:Promoters of Common Core say that it is designed to make America's children ""college and career ready."" We instead judge Common Core to be a recipe for standardized workforce preparation. Common Core shortchanges the central goals of all sound education and surely those of Catholic education: to grow in the virtues necessary to know, love, and serve the Lord, to mature into a responsible, flourishing adult, and to contribute as a citizen to the process of responsible democratic self-government.In fact, we are convinced that Common Core is so deeply flawed that it should not be adopted by Catholic schools which have yet to approve it, and that those schools which have already endorsed it should seek an orderly withdrawal now.In place of Common Core, the new study's authors recommend building upon ""the long Catholic educational tradition, including recent Church and papal writings, to present a positive foundation for moving Catholic schools forward in a post-Common Core world.""The authors say Catholic schools distinguish themselves uniquely from public schools through their embrace of ""the transcendent and universal attributes of truth, beauty, and goodness.""""Goodness teaches about the perfection of being and the enduring goals of each of us,"" they write. ""Truth is to know reality, and proper schooling provides the tools to reason and to gain access to the true nature of reality.""""The advent of the Common Core has not only provided clarity to the unique value of Catholic schools, but also offers the opportunity for
 their advancement and the articulation of their competitive advantage,"" the authors conclude. ""Never were they more attractive. Never were they more needed.""The workforce educational model currently being promoted by the government relies heavily on the concept of training. It aims to train students in certain skills of information-processing and mathematical abilities that transfer rather directly to today's world of work.

The jog is initiated by Ben Kochanski, deputy regional commissioner, GSA Public Buildings Service, whose 2012 salary was $141,066. Kochanski is then joined by Joanna Rosato, regional commissioner of GSA Public Buildings Service, whose 2012 salary was $164,500. Many additional GSA employees then join these two senior officials.Remember: The GSA touts itself as an ""innovation engine"" that helps the government cut costs.It now appears that the GSA did not like our meddling in their fun.The Washington Times recently highlighted a report by the GSA's inspector general concerning the GSA's attempt to strip away our status as a member of the media and to force us to pay exorbitant fees for records:The GSA botched several high-profile open records requests, delaying them for months while political appointees got involved, Inspector General Carol F. Ochoa said. The findings were released while the administration was facing charges of slow-walking open records requests for Hillary Clinton's emails, as well as other requests.In the case of Judicial Watch, the order to strip it of media status came from political operatives with long ties to Democratic causes -- and even from the White House.The inspector general said the decision came at the behest of Gregory Mecher, a former Democratic campaign fundraiser who at the time was liaison to the White House. He is married to Jen Psaki, a longtime spokeswoman with the Obama administration and its election campaigns.Ms. Ochoa said stripping Judicial Watch of media status violated several agency policies and things got worse when the GSA denied an appeal by the group.The IG report was finalized last year but only released the week before last! It was all politically motivated. Surprised?Making matters even worse, it appears that political revenge was behind the GSA/Obama White House attack on Judicial Watch.We obtained those videos three years ago, thanks to a June 15, 2012, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request seeking videos produced by GSA's Northeast Region (known as Region 2) from 2011 through June 2012. Because the agency failed to timely respond to our FOIA request, we filed a lawsuit on May 23, 2013 (Judicial Watch v. U.S. General Services Administration (No. 1:13-cv-00755)).And we won. The court even forced the GSA to reimburse us for expenses.As I told The Washington Times, the GSA's response is outrageous, but not surprising. Welcome to our world. This is what we put up with all the time from the agencies. And we have to ask why White House liaisons are involved in our FOIA request. Judicial Watch apparently is on the Obama administration's enemies' list.The OIG report notes it took nearly a year for the GSA to provide the videos to us, despite the average FOIA response time being about 60 days. On top of that, GSA political operatives snooped around our Internet website and then took away our media status, even though, as it says in the report, ""GSA had granted Judicial Watch press status in the past, most recently for a FOIA request made less than two weeks before.""Judicial Watch was alerted to the existence of these videos by its client Linda Shenwick, a whistleblower in GSA who objected to frivolous expenditures in the GSA's Region 2, the office that produced the videos. Unbelievably, GSA had a policy of encouraging and rewarding employees who produced and performed in the controversial videos. In further retaliation, Ms. Shenwick has since been demoted and effectively removed from her duties.Obviously, the Obama administration did not let the rule of law get in the way of abusing its office to target whistleblowers and Judicial Watch. Just as obvious is the fact that transparent lawlessness in the Clinton-era State Department is but one example of the Obama administration's war against the American people's right to know.The GSA botched several high-profile open records requests, delaying them for months while political appointees got involved, Inspector General Carol F. Ochoa said. The findings were released while the administration was facing charges of slow-walking open records requests for Hillary Clinton's emails, as well as other requests.

""Donald Trump's vision won that debate and Donald Trump's ideas and policies to make America great again are gonna win all the way to Pennsylvania Avenue come November the 8th.""RSVPs for Monday's Pence events soared Sunday night. It was the same night that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump took on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in their second, and very contentious, debate. It was a town hall-style format.Pence was introduced in Fletcher by Congressman Mark Meadows who enthusiastically promoted the Indiana governor on the Trump-Pence ticket, to those gathered. Meadows said Pence, a former congressman, would not change when he returns to Washington.""I joined this campaign in a heartbeat,"" Pence said, lauding praise on his running mate Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. After recognizing the first responders who ""lead into the fight"" and have been coming to the aid of people caught in Hurricane Matthew, he took a moment to address the Trump comments controversy.Ahead of the debate he had expressed hope that America would see what is in Trump's heart during the debate. On Monday Pence said that Trump did indeed show ""the American people what is in his heart."" Pence said that as a Christian he believes in forgiveness and was thankful that Trump apologized and ""I am called to forgive as I am forgiven.""Pence moved on to say, ""The stakes in the election go far beyond what the media is focused on, on any given day.

The drone, which appeared to be one used for surveillance, was taken back to their outpost for examination and exploded while being taken apart.There have been three attempted drone attacks by ISIS in Iraq in recent weeks, officials say. The other two -- one used to attack a checkpoint and destroyed buildings, and the other shot down by Iraqi troops had a small explosive attached to it -- did not result in any deaths.The most recent of the three drones, however, resulted in the deaths of two Kurdish soldiers and injured two French soldiers when an explosive device inside the drone, disguised as a battery, exploded.Pentagon officials say the drones are nothing like those used by the United States, which are about the size of small passenger planes. ISIS is using smaller drones, similar to those available for purchase on Amazon, and modifying them to carry explosives.""We should have been ready for this, and we weren't,"" said P. W.

Twenty-two rebels were wounded but Turkish forces did not suffer any casualties.Turkish warplanes destroyed five buildings used by Islamic State fighters, while U.S.-led coalition jets ""neutralized"" 28 of the jihadists and destroyed three buildings, it said.The operation has also targeted a Kurdish militia whose presence along its border Turkey sees as a threat.SIGN UP"

Over just two years it paid $23 million to the aggressively environmentalist Sea Change Foundation, which in turn distributed the money among smaller organizations.I also brought it up two years earlier for an interview featured in Phelim McAleer and Ann McElhinney's movie FrackNation. We were laughed at at the time as conspiracy theorists. But of course the Russian connection always made perfect sense. The Russian economy is heavily dependent on its natural gas exports and clearly has a vested interest in preventing the adoption of fracking across the world. Hillary's comments - based, no doubt, on US intelligence data - simply confirm what environmentalists would prefer not believe: that far from being cosy, grass-roots, mom-and-pop outfits, anti-fracking groups - and campaigners such as Yoko Ono, Alec Baldwin, Vivienne Westwood and Emma Thompson - are essentially the puppets of Vladimir Putin.FrackNation's makers are now calling on Hillary and the State Department to release the names of all anti-fracking organizations which have received Russian funding.""They are basically acting as paid agents for a hostile foreign power,"" McAleer said. ""This is possibly illegal and is most definitely deeply disturbing and unethical. The State Department needs to name and shame these groups now.""This won't, of course, happen - not least because anti-fracking is one of those areas where Russia's views and those of both the Obama administration and that of its preferred successor Hillary Clinton align almost perfectly.Indeed, anti-fracking is the default position of the entire liberal political and media class, not to mention any number of US foundations (Rockefeller; Hewlett; Packard; Gordon and Betty Moore; etc) built on the proceeds of the capitalist system but now largely dedicated to undermining it.

As he moved closer to the nomination, he had to tone down some of his attacks.He is now free to renew them -- and they may work, provided he retains the message discipline he has learned (somewhat) along the way.There are some exceptions. Trump remains on friendly terms with Reince Priebus and the Republican National Committee (RNC). Trump obeys a simple principle in his relationships: he is friendly to those who are friendly to him, and nasty to those who are not, until they recant. (He seems willing to apply that rule to foreign policy as well, which is why he has not yet shown the requisite outrage towards Russia's Vladimir Putin.) He will not attack the party as a whole.Yet he will run against its leadership -- and he has no other choice, because the Republican Party will not be unified before November (if ever). He has to pull votes from the disaffected, and from Democrats.The simple truth of American politics is that while Republicans have better, and more popular, policies, they have a terrible brand. That is why Trump was able to lap the field in the primary.The question is whether Trump's own brand, battered by the political contest, is still any better.Strip away the daily news cycle, and the 2016 presidential election boils down to the following choice. Hillary Clinton offers a status quo that voters know is corrupt, and incapable of grappling with the country's challenges, both internal and external, but which might be just stable enough to stave off disaster for long enough for better leaders to emerge.Donald Trump offers a shakeup that is high-risk, high-reward: it could lead to making America great again, but it could also lead to greater chaos.To win, Trump has to minimize his own risk profile while making the status quo as intolerable as possible. The Republican leadership represents that status quo, even though every single Republican in high office in Congress owes his position to a revolt against Washington that stretches across three elections. They promised to change the system, and they barely tried.Ryan has given Trump a target, however inadvertently. Trump's challenge is to convince voters he is an acceptable alternative.Joel B.

New reports say the woman not only sat back and watched the attack and murder but then had sex with the attacker 20 minutes after her daughter died.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIn August, police in New Mexico discovered the burning body of ten-year-old Victoria Martens in an Albuquerque apartment building. An investigation showed that the child had been dosed with meth, viciously raped, then stabbed to death and dismembered.Shockingly, police accused the child's mother, Michelle Martens, 35, of arranging for her boyfriend, Fabian Gonzales, 31, to rape her child. Police also accused Martens of helping to stab the child to death and dismembering her. Gonzales's cousin, Jessica Kelley, 31, was also arrested for participating in the horrific crime.Now new details from the investigation obtained by KRQE News 13 reveal that police think Martens sat back and watched her own daughter's death and then had sex with the child's killer.One hundred pages of police records show that Martens initially tried to tell police that her boyfriend's cousin attacked them in the middle of the night and she was the one who killed the little girl.Then her story began to change. Martens later admitted that Gonzales had been sexually abusing the 10-year-old Victoria for up to a month before the murder.But ultimately the records show Martens gave up her claims of being a victim and admitted she had allowed several men to have sex with the child and named at least two men who did so. Worse, according to KTLA, Martens admitted she watched the murder and even had sex with Gonzales after her child was dead.Each suspect is being held on a one million dollar bond and will face trials early next year.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.SIGN UP

Opening the event for Trump as he has often done on the campaign trail was former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.Giuliani commented on the news of the day, in particular the recent revelations included in the WikiLeaks drop, and he called out Trump's opponent Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.""I actually believe while looking at all these Wikileaks, we're dealing with a pathological liar,"" Giuliani said to a cheering crowd.The heaviest applause was saved for Trump himself, when he immediately attacked Clinton as a ""vessel"" for the establishment.""Hillary is a vessel for the corrupt global establishment that is raiding our country and ruining the sovereignty of our nation,"" he said in the opening moments of his rally.When asked by Breitbart News about the recently unveiled Access Hollywood audio from 2005 showing Trump making lewd comments about women, attendees shrugged it off and said he ""was still better than Hillary"" or that ""Clinton had done much worse"" while serving in government.Trump told attendees should Clinton be elected, it could mean the end of such rallies and urged attendees to get out the vote.""You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life,"" he said. ""You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like nobody has ever seen before. It really is. It is an amazing thing. We take it for granted almost. It is an amazing thing.Panama City Beach is the first of four stops in three days in Florida for the GOP nominee. Tomorrow, Trump will make appearances in Ocala and Lakeland. On Thursday, he will appear in West Palm Beach.Trump has lost some ground in Florida in recent polls -- down by less than six points, according to the Real Clear Politics average.Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poorSIGN UP"

"The recent dump by WikiLeaks of hacked emails from the chairman of Hillary R. Clinton's presidential campaign chairman exposed John Podesta's obsession with aliens ... not immigrants. Podesta is obsessed with space aliens.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERPodesta found other people who shared his interest in spacemen, like the former lead singer of the band Blink-182, Tom DeLonge.The pop star was working on a documentary on UFOs and aliens and he was following up on his interview with Podesta:Hi John- Tom DeLonge here,The one who interviewed you for that special documentary not to long ago. Things are moving with the project. The Novels, Films and NonFiction works are blooming and finishing. Just had a preliminary meeting with Spielberg's Chief Operating Officer at DreamWorks. More meetings are now on the books- I would like to bring two very ""important"" people out to meet you in DC. I think you will find them very interesting, as they were principal leadership relating to our sensitive topic.Both were in charge of most fragile divisions, as it relates to Classified Science and DOD topics. Other words, these are A-Level officials. Worth our time, and as well the investment to bring all the way out to you. I just need 2 hours from you. Just looking to have a casual, and private conversation in person. -Here are some photos from the material I am using as I meet with Studio Partners.Best, Tom DeLongeIn a Nov. 16 email, Podesta's aide Milia Fisher forwarded a message from DeLonge, whom Fisher says ""apparently"" met with director Steven Spielberg about a UFO crash at Area 51 and he wanted to bring Podesta into the project and show him a short video about it.""Please show Mr. Podesta this private teaser. Let him know that I am spending all afternoon interviewing a scientist that worked on a spacecraft at Area 51 tomorrow,"" DeLonge wrote.In the WikiLeaks dump, there are emails confirming a Jan. 25 Google hangout between Podesta and DeLonge and later that day, the singer follows up about Air Force Maj. Gen. William N. McCasland:He mentioned he's a ""skeptic"", he's not. I've been working with him for four months. I just got done giving him a four hour presentation on the entire project a few weeks ago.Trust me, the advice is already been happening on how to do all this. He just has to say that out loud, but he is very, very aware- as he was in charge of all of the stuff. When Roswell crashed, they shipped it to the laboratory at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. General McCasland was in charge of that exact laboratory up to a couple years ago.He not only knows what I'm trying to achieve, he helped assemble my advisory team. He's a very important man.Best,Tom DeLongeDeLonge was not the only rocker reaching out the Podesta about encounters of the third kind.Small Black guitarist Juan Pieczanski checked in with Podesta after he tweeted Feb. 13, 2015, on his last day as a senior advisor to President Barack Obama: ""Finally, my biggest failure of 2014: Once again not securing the #disclosure of the UFO files. #thetruthisstilloutthere cc: @NYTimesDowd.""Three days later, Pieczanski emailed:I'm not sure if you check this email, but it's the only one I could find online.I went to school with Gabe at Murch, and recently saw your twitter post about UFO disclosure. I have been researching this phenomenon for a little  over a decade. I am familiar with Dr. Greer as well as John Mack's work on  abduction, Budd Hopkins, Stanton Friedman, David Jacobs, the list goes on  and on! Anyway, I've been meaning to reach out since reading Leslie Kean's book.I'm sure we share some similar frustrations at a lack of disclosure of  perhaps the most important thing humanity has ever experienced. If there is  anything I can do to help, in any way, please let me know.There aren't many legitimate people out there speaking on this topic. Especially people who have held your positions in government. Is disclosure on the horizon? Can we make it happen under Hillary? We cant let the military corporations  block disclosure any longer!Thanks for your time, JuanPodesta replied: "" Thanks for your note, Juan.  Are you still in DC? Lots of work to do. I'll say hi to Gabe for you.  John""Whoa. Was Podesta about to hire his son's buddy from college to go UFO and alien hunting?We may never find out.The guitarist was a road warrior living out another dream: ""I'm in NY, came here for Columbia and stayed. Living in Brooklyn, worked in tv now I'm in a touring band full time. Anyway, yes lots of work to do, best of luck, and again if there's anything I can do -Juan""But, the pursuit for Podesta is still ongoing.Speaking June 2 at the Code Conference, a media and technology trade show and convention held in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, Podesta was asked by Kara Swisher: ""Do you think there might be aliens?""""I think there might be two issues,"" Podesta said. ""One, are there aliens and, two, have we been visited-or visited recently by aliens.""The wiry former White House chief of staff for President William J. Clinton sat deep in his chair and crossed his legs as he responded.""It seems to me inconceivable that there aren't aliens,"" he said.Because he knows aliens exist he is pretty sure they have visited earth, he said.Other governments have opened up their files and established small teams to review documents as part of an official investigation, Podesta said. ""Rather than be embarrassed, ashamed and treating it as something that has to be put into black programs everywhere.""The former first lady's campaign chairman said, ""Let the public in on what we know.""This is not a new thing for Podesta. He told Steve Sebelius, the host of Las Vegas Now on KLAS-TV that he made the Democratic nominee a believer that aliens are real and she should address the issue as president.""I've talked to Hillary about it,"" Podesta said to Sebelius. ""I think I've convinced her that we need an effort to look at that and declassify as much as we can.""In an sit-down interview posted Dec. 30 in The Conway Daily Sun, Clinton gave her word that she believed aliens and UFO's were real: ""I think we may have been (visited already). We don't know for sure.""As president, Clinton would investigate the rumors surrounding Area 51, she said.Clinton also credited her chairman:Hillary Clinton, while at the Sun, added that the chairman of her campaign, John Podesta, is a huge fan of UFO lore. She said he enjoys a sci-fi show  on the FX network. Podesta served as chief of staff to Bill Clinton and counselor to the president for Barack Obama.""He has made me personally pledge we are going to get the information out,"" said Clinton. ""One way or another. Maybe we could have, like, a task force to go to Area 51.""Time will tell how Podesta's UFO obsession affects his current or future employment.The HeatStreet website reported that DeLonge's obsession cost him his job:DeLonge's UFO obsession was what reportedly broke up Blink-182, which released a new album July 1, 2016, but with a different lead singer. He spent hours doing his own research, and claiming to work with with ""at least ten people,"" which alienated his bandmates and led to speculation that DeLonge was paranoid, or suffered from a mental illness.When the two other members of Blink-182, Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker, gave DeLonge an ultimatem -- lose the aliens and stick with the band for six months so they could produce another studio album -- DeLonge picked the aliens.According to WikiLeaks there is enough material to make significant dumps between now and Election Day.Whether there is more about Podesta's extraterrestrials and their flying saucers, in the end it is up to Donald J. Trump to make a campaign issue of the other aliens.Hi John- Tom DeLonge here,

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe hacked document includes the most politically awkward statements in Clinton's many paid speeches to business groups, including Goldman Sachs. In those speeches, Clinton urged business groups to back Republicans facing opposition from the Tea Party, to defund Republicans who wanted to trim spending on the 2012 storm aid for New Jersey, and to support Republicans and Democratic legislators who drafted the 2013 immigration expansion bill. She urged the business groups to lobby legislators for more H-1B outsourcing visas, to support Republicans who endorsed the 2013 decision to raise the federal government's credit-limit,  and to oppose Sen. Ted Cruz for his 2012 effort to defund the Obamacare health network.She did not mention Cruz, but she criticized a ""very few [Senators] in the Senate ... holding hostage the entire rest of the government and putting the full faith in [sic] credit of the United States at risk."" That's likely a reference to the 2013 Senate debate when Cruz tried to defund Obamacare.Here's are some of the examples cited in the Clinton campaign document.Hillary Clinton Said Moderate Voices In Congress Need More Support, Citing Eight-Senator Immigration Compromise. ""So we got to make sure that we begin listening to each other, we begin to reward people who try to make the tough decisions in the middle like these eight senators on immigration for republicans and for democrats.

I can forgive 'em, I suppose, if they're sincere about it, but I don't want them necessarily leading the country,"" he said.Obama said that it was impossible for both Christians and Republicans to continue to denounce Trump's comments but to still support him for president.""You can't have it both ways here,"" he said. ""You can't repeatedly denounce what is said by someone and then say, 'But I'm still going to endorse them to be the most powerful person in the planet and to put them in charge.'""He ridiculed Republicans for suddenly running away from Trump after standing by him despite offensive comments.""We saw this coming, he's been saying really bad things for a while now.

""I mean, I'm 55, I know it's hard for me to change, I know at 70 it's going to be harder.""Obama said that Trump's comments about women were unacceptable, adding that someone who acted like that couldn't get hired at a 7/11, let alone become president of the United States.""You don't have to be a husband or father to say, 'That's not right.'

"During his October 11 speech in Panama City, Florida, Donald Trump said Hillary Clinton ""wants to dismantle our Second Amendment"" and asked why she can't start by dismantling her armed security detail.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERTrump segued into his Second Amendment comments by talking about Clinton's relationship with law enforcement personnel:We've all read the reports and heard the stories about how disrespectfully she treats law enforcement, how disrespectful she is to the Secret Service and many others in uniform-even [those] there to protect her. And by the way, these are weapon-carrying people. They carry weapons. Hillary Clinton wants to dismantle our Second Amendment, so maybe she should start with her security people not carrying weapons.On August 7, Breitbart News reported that Clinton ""snubbed"" the National Fraternal Order of Police (NFOP). The president of the NFOP -- Chuck Canterbury -- said he was ""disappointed and shocked"" that Clinton ""declined"" to even return a candidate questionnaire which had been sent to her campaign. Canterbury said the only other candidate to ever refuse to answer the questionnaire was John Kerry in 2004.Additionally, the October 7 Wikileaks release contained an email from Clinton's press secretary explaining that she is planning to use an ""executive order"" to implement gun control that Congress has rejected for decades. And during the October 9 presidential debate, part of Clinton's response to a question about the future of the Supreme Court was her emphasis on all the gun controls she wants to put in place.On the other hand, Trump was endorsed by the National Fraternal Order of Police and he pledged to nominate Supreme Court justices ""in the mold of Justice Scalia."" He described such justices as an integral part of guarding the Second Amendment, ""which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton.""AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

Not holding a vote to ensure ""the full compliment of nine Supreme Court justices"" is a ""dereliction of duty,"" she said.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSoon after, Judicial Crisis Network Chief Counsel Carrie Severino--a former law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas--tweeted, ""If 'not permitting a vote' on Garland is a dereliction of duty, Hillary is equally guilty as she tried to prevent a vote on Alito.""Severino is correct. When President George W. Bush nominated Samuel Alito to fill the Supreme Court seat being vacated by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Democratic senators--including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton--attempted to filibuster Alito. Even though he had majority support in the Senate Judiciary Committee and among the full Senate, Clinton attempted to stop his nomination from ever coming to a vote.Clinton failed. In the end, 72 senators voted to end debate, and then Alito was confirmed on Jan. 31, 2006, as the 110th justice of the Supreme Court by a vote of 58-42. But Clinton did everything possible to prevent the Senate from holding that vote.There is historical precedent for not confirming a Supreme Court nomination made during a presidential election year. There is also an argument that since the American people gave the presidency to one party but the Senate to the other, the voters could debate for several months what kind of justice they want to fill the seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia.Indeed, in the past Vice President Joseph Biden has declared the Senate should not vote during a presidential election year. Sen. Charles Schumer says the Senate can wait even longer to prevent Republican nominees--at least 18 months.There is no such explanation for why Clinton attempted to block a vote on a nomination made only one year into a presidential term. It is unclear whether she might have believed it acceptable to keep open that seat all the way until the end of Bush's term on Jan. 20, 2009.But will any reporter in Clinton's press pool ask her for an explanation?Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

The policy compromise also allows some dual-sex bathrooms for students who say they are transgender.""This resolution agreed to by a majority of the board of directors of the Pine-Richland School District indicates our support to return to the long-standing practice of providing sex-specific facility usage,"" said the resolution, passed in a 5-4 decision. ""All students will have the choice of using either the facilities that correspond to their biological sex or [to] unisex facilities. This practice will remain in place until such time that a policy may be developed and approved.""But the three students and their lawyer insist that the new compromise resolution violates both Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution.The students object to the compromise creation of some dual-sex bathrooms. That's because they want the school officials -- plus the teachers and students and parents -- to officially endorse their claims to have switched gender. That endorsement would be delivered when school officials agree to let the few transgender students use bathrooms designated for the opposite sex, regardless of opposition from normal students.Attorney Omar Gonzalez-Pagan said the students ""want to be able to graduate from Pine-Richland knowing the school recognized and respected who they are.""""Forcing them to use restrooms that do match their identity erases students' gender identity, endangers the health and safety of transgender students and isolates them from the entire student body and at the same time violates their privacy,"" the attorney claimed.Earlier in the year, the Obama administration essentially used a backdoor method to force all public schools to change many school rules to allow transgender students to choose their own bathrooms and locker rooms. That policy echoes the far-left ""gender ideology,"" which insists that government should force Americans to accept claims by individuals who say their gender is different from their male or female biology.Predicated on Title IX, President Barack Obama issued a May decree that schools must welcome a tiny number of purportedly transgender children by taking single-sex bathrooms, single-sex locker rooms, and sexual privacy away from almost 55 million American kids in 100,000 K-12 public schools across the nation. ""There is no room in our schools for discrimination of any kind, including discrimination against transgender students on the basis of their sex,"" activist U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a statement at the time.Of course, this Pittsburgh-area district is far from the only school district grappling with the transgender ideology. Earlier this year, students in Vermont and Missouri rebelled against decisions by their school administrators to allow transgender students to choose whichever bathroom they feel like using.Some religious-based schools have also filed suit in federal court to stop the government from forcing them to accept transgenderism in violation of the separation of church and state and religious freedom.In addition, over a dozen states have gathered together to join a federal lawsuit filed by the Texas Attorney General against the Obama administration's Title IX demands.In their lawsuit, the combined states insist that ""Neither the text nor the legislative history of Title IX supports an interpretation of the term 'sex' as meaning anything other than one's sex as determined by anatomy and genetics.""Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.SIGN UP"
