He made clear exactly what is at stake on November 8th.""We have 41 days to make our country great again,"" Trump said. ""You have one magnificent chance and in our opinion our last chance.""Trump railed against the special interests propping up this country -- the ones who all go to the same restaurants and conferences -- and vowed that we will once again have a government of, by, and for the people.""Have you ever seen a greater embarrassment to our country? The people getting rich off the rigged system, and they don't want it to change, are throwing money at Hillary Clinton,"" he said. ""She's an insider fighting only for her donors.""""They nod along when Hillary slanders you and calls you deplorable and irredeemable. What she doesn't understand is you're the greatest people on Earth...You're smart, you're sharp. You really want one thing. You want to Make America Great Again.""Trump took a sideways shot at debate moderator Lester Holt, whom he called ""the emcee"" who was arguing with him about stop-and-frisk and ""taking up a lot of time."" He also spoke about his trip to Little Havana and asked if there were any Cubans in the house, with a beautiful woman behind him standing up and cheering.When he said that black and Hispanic citizens are entitled to the same protection as every other American, a shout rang out: ""That's right!""""Thousands and thousands of people are being shot,"" Trump said. ""We have to help them. It's unacceptable. 6,000 African-Americans are victims...Nine more people were shot in Chicago yesterday. Yesterday!""""I will never back down! I will never back down from trying to save American lives! Never! I will never back down from fighting to rebuild our inner cities. How much more violence must there be on our streets until Hillary Clinton drops her scripted lines!""""We're going to get rid of that crooked woman!""""I want to go into the forgotten neighborhoods, the failing schools...and unlock their potential for the American people.""""We are going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. Okay?"" he said, promising that once more we will have a country with ""one people under one God saluting one American flag.""Chants of ""USA! USA! USA!"" filled the Florida night.SIGN UP"

They base that claim on a tepid 2002 endorsement by Trump when he was being interviewed on Howard Stern's radio show. ""Yeah, I guess so,"" Trump said when asked if he supported the pending campaign.In sharp contrast to Trump's comments as a New York real-estate developer, then-New York Sen. Hillary Clinton repeatedly spoke in favor of the campaign, and she cast her vote to authorize and fund the war.The new tape of Trump's opposition comes from January 2003, before the operation was launched.""Well, I'm starting to think that people are much more focused now on the economy,"" Trump told Fox News' Neil Cavuto. ""They're getting a little bit tired of hearing 'We're going in, we're not going in.' Whatever happened to the days of [Gen.] Douglas MacArthur? Either do it or don't do it.""""Perhaps he shouldn't be doing it yet. And perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations,"" Trump said.""The Iraqi situation is a problem, and I think the economy is a much bigger problem,"" he added.During the September 26 presidential debate, moderator Lester Holt insisted that it was a proven fact that Donald Trump supported George W. Bush's war in Iraq before Trump was against it.Holt insisted that GOP nominee Donald Trump ""had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion.""The real estate mogul adamantly rejected the assertion and re-iterated that he was always against the war. ""The record shows that I'm right,"" Trump said to Holt. ""When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, 'I don't know, maybe, who knows?' Essentially. I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto. We talked about the economy is more important [than going to war].""Holt, accused of acting as a third debater that night, cut Trump off saying, ""The record does not show that.""Like many on the left goaded by the Clinton campaign's media shop, Holt was referring to Donald Trump's interview with radio's Howard Stern in 2002. When asked during the Stern interview if the U.S. should invade Iraq, Trump replied with a very weak affirmation, ""Yeah, I guess so.""This January focus on the economy is a far more negative characterization of the impending war than his earlier, more noncommittal ""yeah, I guess so.""Despite this record, several so-called fact checkers and other media outlets have continued to claim Trump fully supported the war before he turned against it.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.SIGN UP"

They're ignoring the medical reports.Voters -- especially men -- have more confidence that Trump is healthy enough for the presidency than Clinton, according to the Associated Press-GfK poll.It's a disconnect considering Clinton has released more medical information than Trump, and that outside doctors who've looked at the available data say both candidates seem fine. But it shows the political points Trump scored after the Democratic nominee's much-publicized mild case of pneumonia.Another gender divide: Nearly half of women but just 4 in 10 men think Clinton's health is getting too much attention, found the poll, which was taken before the presidential candidates' debate on Monday.""Everybody gets sick,"" said Sherri Smart, 56, of New York. She said she hasn't decided who to vote for but wishes the candidates would discuss issues instead of sniping about who's most vigorous.""What's important is, what are you going to do for me?"" Smart said.The AP-GfK poll found 51 percent of voters are very or extremely confident that Trump is healthy enough to be president. In contrast, just over a third of voters -- 36 percent -- had the same confidence in Clinton's health.Men are more likely to question Clinton's physical fitness for the job, with 45 percent saying they're only slightly or not at all confident compared to 34 percent of women. Men and women are about equally likely to express confidence in Trump's health. More Democrats are confident of Trump's health than Republicans are of Clinton's.Health is a legitimate issue as the nation is poised to elect one of its oldest presidents. Trump, 70, for months held off disclosing much about his own fitness while stoking questions about a woman in the White House with his assertion, repeated on national TV Monday, that Clinton lacks the look and stamina for the job. (As for his apparent sniffles during Monday's debate, he blamed a bad microphone.)""Stamina is a code word for maybe not physically up to the job,"" said New York University bioethicist Arthur Caplan, who has called for an independent panel to certify the health of presidential candidates. ""There's something of a bias about men versus women that subtly Trump has played to, that men are more fit, tough enough to do the job.""Clinton, 68, last year released more detail about her own health history only to buy trouble earlier this month by refusing to take a sick day until a public stumble forced her to reveal the pneumonia diagnosis. But Monday she rebutted Trump's talk of stamina by wondering if he could match her grueling schedule as a secretary of state -- traveling to 112 countries, negotiating peace deals, spending 11 hours testifying before a congressional committee.What exactly do we know about their health? Neither has released their actual medical records, just a summary from their personal physicians with no way to know if anything important was left out.Yet another disconnect: The AP-GfK poll found nearly 4 in 10 voters don't consider such a release important, and another 2 in 10 say it's only moderately important.Trump's gastroenterologist in December released a four-paragraph letter saying the GOP nominee would be ""the healthiest individual ever elected."" Earlier this month, Trump took to ""The Dr. Oz Show"" to say he felt great, while releasing a bit more detail, such as his cholesterol levels and cancer screenings.Bottom line: Trump takes a cholesterol-lowering statin medication and a baby aspirin, has some mild plaque in his arteries and is overweight -- but was declared generally in good health.Last summer, Clinton's internist released a two-page letter detailing her family history, prior exams including lab test results, and some prior ailments that have healed -- including a 2012 concussion and blood clot Clinton suffered after becoming dehydrated from a stomach virus and fainting. This month, a second letter outlined the mild pneumonia and revealed some updated check-up results.Bottom line: Clinton takes a blood thinner as a precaution given a history of blood clots, as well as a thyroid medication and allergy relievers -- but also was declared generally in good health.Some doctors say just watching how the candidates handle a physically demanding campaign trail and the cognitive finesse needed to debate can give voters a good idea of health.But while the public may not pay attention to cholesterol tests and EKGs, it was hard to miss that image of Clinton stumbling.""The public is feeding off the impressions they've received, but that's not borne out by the letters of health,"" said Dr. Howard Selinger, chair of family medicine at Quinnipiac University.___The AP-GfK Poll of 1,694 adults, including 1,476 registered voters, was conducted online Sept. 15-19, using a sample drawn from GfK's probability-based KnowledgePanel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 2.5 percentage points, and for registered voters is plus or minus 2.7 percentage points.Respondents were first selected randomly using telephone or mail survey methods and later interviewed online.

""So now the big question is: Will K-12 education get any more attention in the next Clinton-Trump debate, which is slated to be held on Sunday, Oct. 9 at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo.?""Though education is often not the sexiest issue, its profound importance on the state of the nation is virtually unsurpassed. In fact, education is a primary reason the United States has lurched so far leftward in its acceptance of illegal immigrants and denigration of capitalism. Many - if not most - of the individuals now running local, state, and federal ""big government"" agencies were educated in America's public schools over the past several decades. In these public schools, our current government leaders learned the doctrine that America is a plundering nation whose people are generally wealthy and use up most of the resources of the world. Therefore, of course its borders should be open and, of course, its businesses should be highly regulated to ensure no one makes more of a profit than they deserve.Current-day students are being exposed to curricula that are even further left-leaning, to the point of sending the message that America itself is to blame for the terrorist attacks on 9/11. Where will the country be when these students have internalized this doctrine and become America's leaders in the next decade or two? Any wall that might be built soon to send the message that immigrants must come legally can easily be dismantled when new leaders emerge in the next decade who have been taught its construction was selfish and lacking in compassion toward people simply trying to find a better life in America.Trump has acknowledged that local control of education works better than Washington, D.C. dictating from afar. He has hinted at possibly dismantling the U.S. Department of Education, though how he would do that remains a mystery.""A first-class public school education, as well as options for alternatives through charter schools, school choice, and homeschooling, is a right, not a privilege,"" Trump recently said in Pennsylvania. ""The opportunity to attend a two or four-year college, or to pursue a trade or a skill set through vocational and technical education, should be easier to access, pay for, and finish. Education is the bedrock of our society.""The GOP nominee has also consistently said that the Common Core State Standards program is ""a disaster."" He was more vocal about Common Core, however, when Jeb Bush was still in the primary race and Trump could easily point to a sharp difference between Common Core-supporter Bush and himself.As the general election approaches, the nominee has not given much more detail about how Common Core could be eradicated during a Trump administration. Despite substantial ground efforts over the past seven years, grassroots parent activists have encountered stiff resistance to ridding the states of Common Core from both Democrat and Republican legislators and governors, fearful of losing federal funding or reluctant to engage in the process of coming up with their own state standards.The area of education that Trump has mentioned more often of late is ""school choice."" As he has campaigned in some of the country's inner cities, the Republican nominee has said he will be ""the nation's biggest cheerleader for school choice."" To that end, Trump said that, if elected, he would use $20 billion to establish a block grant to fund school choice for children living in low-income areas.Public schools are ""our government-run monopoly"" that has ""trapped millions of African-American and Hispanic youth in failing government schools that deny them the opportunity to join the ladder of American success,"" Trump said in a speech at the Cleveland Arts and Social Sciences Academy earlier in September, adding that he supports merit pay for teachers ""so that we reward great teachers - instead of the failed tenure system that rewards bad teachers and punishes good ones.""The concept of ""school choice"" is very appealing, but the means of bringing about the ""choice"" is critical if education freedom is a goal, as Trump says. School vouchers, for example, are a transfer of taxpayer funds from a public school to another charter, private, or religious school. If parents ""choose"" to send their children to a participating school, that school may have additional regulatory burdens placed upon it by the state in which it is located in order to qualify to accept vouchers. The overarching question then becomes why transfer a child to a school when it might have the same regulations, test requirements, or even ""social justice"" mandates as the public school?Nationally, overall support for school choice has remained steady over the past year, according to a new Education Next poll. Support for school vouchers, however, has declined as more parents and taxpayers have learned that voucher programs open up private and religious schools that accept them to increased regulation by the states.""The EdNext findings on school choice suggest that program design matters,"" the Heritage Foundation's Lindsey Burke told Breitbart News. She added:The poll results found a drop in support for school vouchers, which could reflect recent experiences in states that have heavily regulated their school voucher programs, leading, paradoxically - as the regulations were promulgated in the name of accountability - to lower participation among high quality private schools.Burke also observed the increase in popularity of education savings accounts.""It is also possible that lower support for vouchers could reflect a desire for a more refined version of school choice, in the form of education savings accounts (ESAs),"" she explained. ""ESAs have been highly popular in states considering adopting education choice policies, and more and more families are now benefiting from the customization that ESAs enable.""Also reviewing the EdNext survey, Jason Bedrick, policy analyst with the Cato Institute's Center for Educational Freedom, writes that scholarship tax credits (STCs) are ""once again, the most popular type of school choice program:With the addition of South Dakota earlier this year, there are now 17 states that have 21 STC programs. Last year, more than 230,000 students used tax-credit scholarships to attend the private school of their choice, compared to about 150,000 students who used school vouchers and about 6,000 who used education savings accounts ESAs. Their high level of public support makes them the most politically viable form of school choice and because they are privately (rather than publicly) funded, they have a perfect record of being upheld as constitutional, making them the most constitutionally viable form of school choice yet devised as well.Senior director of the Center for Education at Pacific Research Institute Lance Izumi also tells Breitbart News Trump's identification of school choice as a central strategy to achieve success for all students is on target.""Donald Trump wants to end the government education monopoly and empower parents and their children,"" Izumi noted, adding:Mr. Trump's vision speaks to ordinary Americans in a way that is unfathomable to the big teacher unions, entrenched government education officials, and to organizations like Black Lives Matter, which has just come out against charter schools. Mr. Trump's school-choice proposal demonstrates that he understands that an education system exists for the learning of our children, not as an expensive jobs program for protected adults.However, like other education analysts, Izumi cautions that school choice should not come about with government ""strings"" attached.""Trump said that states should come up with their own formulas and programs as to how to implement choice, so it is imperative that both the federal government and the states ensure that private schools are protected from intrusive government regulations and mandates,"" he said.Heather Crossin, co-founder of Hoosiers Against Common Core in Indiana tells Breitbart News, ""Parents who have been fighting Common Core are counting on Donald Trump to ensure that future federal block grants to the states no longer contain the ""all controlling"" strings that plagued No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top.""""He must eliminate the federal testing requirements, which have been the biggest 'stick' used by the federal government to infect and pollute America's schools with greatly detested Common Core curriculums,"" she further explains.Neal McCluskey, director of the Center for Educational Freedom at Cato Institute, also tells Breitbart News that school choice is ""the key to empowering parents to get the education that is best for their unique children, and for educators to teach how they want and try new, innovative approaches.""""But this is not something that should come from Washington,"" he stresses, adding:The federal government has no constitutional authority to meddle in education, and as it has proven over the last several decades--including by coercing states to adopt the Common Core--once it starts paying for education it starts controlling it, telling everyone what to do and how to do it. The federal government should be withdrawn from education except in Washington, DC, itself, federal installations, and prohibiting state and local discrimination in providing education.""It is what the Constitution demands, and fifty-plus years of experience with federal spending and interference tells us is right,"" McCluskey concludes.The poll results found a drop in support for school vouchers, which could reflect recent experiences in states that have heavily regulated their school voucher programs, leading, paradoxically - as the regulations were promulgated in the name of accountability - to lower participation among high quality private schools.With the addition of South Dakota earlier this year, there are now 17 states that have 21 STC programs.

Ryan (R.-Wis.) wants to pass a jail-sentence reduction bill through the House after the election, according to a Politico article.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe proposed sentencing-rollback law has hit a wall because House Republicans don't want to seem weak on crime and punishment during an election season, according to Politico.The Wisconsin Republican for weeks has repeated his personal desire to move a bipartisan package that would include allowing well-behaved nonviolent prisoners to be eligible for early release and easing some drug-related sentencing requirements...Sources familiar with Ryan's thinking say he's not ready to relent just yet because of the charged political environment. While he wasn't able to pass the Judiciary package in September as he originally hoped, Ryan is now eyeing the lame-duck session, by which time tensions might have eased.If passed, the bill would reduce mandatory minimum sentences and would expand rules for early release.But the bill is being held up by opposition in the Senate from Sen. Tom Cotton (R.-Ark.) and Sen. Jeff Sessions (R.-Ala.) in the Senate. They note that murder rates are rising rapidly.Equally importantly, and unreported in the Politico article,  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and other Republicans want any sentencing-reduction bill to include curbs on regulators' ability to prosecute business executives. So far, Democrats have rejected Hatch's proposed mens rea reform.In the House, Ryan's bill is apparently opposed by House conservatives, such as Rep. Bill Flores (R.-Texas), the chairman of the Republican Study Committee. Flores told Politico:But the skepticism or resistance among Republicans is real. ""It doesn't sell back home right now,"" said Rep. Bill Flores of Texas, chairman of the Republican Study Committee. ""When you say, 'Hey, I'm voting for criminal justice reform,' they'll say, 'What? You're letting prisoners out of prison early?'""While he personally believes the Justice Committee has crafted some smart proposals, Flores said it doesn't help that it's a key priority of President Barack Obama. The situation in Charlotte and elsewhere has also complicated the equation. ""I think that what could be a good bill could be perceived differently because of current events,"" he said.Resistance from House conservatives is not a deal-breaker for the Republican House leadership. But opposition in the Senate is not easily dismissed because 60 votes are required to force votes.With three months left in this session of Congress, there is plenty of time to pass a bill the Speaker of the House wants to get passed.The Wisconsin Republican for weeks has repeated his personal desire to move a bipartisan package that would include allowing well-behaved nonviolent prisoners to be eligible for early release and easing some drug-related sentencing requirements...

That's all there? All the money that she's earned, where it came from?"" Goldberg pressed.""It's all public, yep,"" Mook insisted.As Donald Trump's presidential campaign pointed out with an instant fact check, this is not entirely accurate.For one thing, the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership, a Canadian operation run by Bill Clinton's friend Frank Giustra, is not required to disclose its donors to tax authorities under Canadian law. It's not even clear exactly how much money this partnership has taken in.A few of the CGEP donors were named after press scrutiny in 2015, but at least a thousand of them were not disclosed.The Hill reported on September 1st that the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership ""sent more than $25 million of largely untraceable donations to the Clinton Foundation before being pressured into revealing some of its donors.""Giustra insists he will not reveal all of the donors because ""under Canadian laws and charitable best practices, charitable donors have a right to privacy.""As The Hill put it, this means ""the American public has to instead take Giustra at his word"" that none of the money flowing into the Clinton Foundation comes from ""foreign or Canadian governments or government-controlled entities.""Also problematic is the Clinton Health Access Initiative, which did not fully disclose its donors throughout Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, despite promises to the contrary. According to a 2015 Reuters report, no complete list of donors was provided between 2010 and 2013.The CHAI does post a donor list now, but The Hill reports on a lingering mystery: ""a line item in the organization's disclosure form -- within the $100,000 to $1 million bracket -- that simply says 'individual and unsolicited donations,' without revealing the identities of these donors.""In a previously published list of broken Clinton transparency promises, The Hill also noted that the Clinton Health Access Initiative was supposed to submit foreign government donations to the State Department ethics office for review, but ""blatantly"" failed to keep that commitment, which was made by Hillary Clinton herself during her confirmation hearings. None of the foreign donations made to the CHAI between 2009 and 2013 were submitted for such a review.SIGN UP"

The White House has claimed that the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, is in retreat. But Committee chairman Sen. Ron Johnson got some amazing answers out of Jeh Johnson, who admitted some weakness on the Southern border in the government's efforts to stop Middle Eastern illegal aliens ""from the other hemisphere,"" as Jeh Johnson called them.""We haven't reduced their capability. The diaspora has already begun,"" Sen. Ron Johnson stated, referring to the Islamic State. ""We're poking the hive. We've done some damage to it but the killer bees are leaving the hive. They're setting up new hives.""Nicholas Rasmussen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, also offered testimony that pushed back on the notion that the Islamic State is not on the rise.Hillary Clinton's emailsDonald Trump was the only one of the three debate participants -- moderator Lester Holt included -- who brought up the Hillary Clinton email scandal. Trump challenged Clinton to release the 33,000 emails that she deleted from her private server.Sen. Ben Sasse, a #NeverTrumper no less, was particularly interested in getting Comey to talk about why Hillary Clinton was not indicted, and why her top aide Cheryl Mills was granted immunity.""The immunity was, we will not use, the Department of Justice, anything against you on this laptop,"" Comey told Sasse. ""This was, in the negotiation, a tool to get the laptop.""""Well it's a lawyer's laptop,"" Comey added. ""By June of this year I wanted that laptop...This was the way to get it.""The Deportation-to-Citizenship MistakeThe U.S. federal government accidentally gave citizenship to more than 700 illegal aliens who were set to be deported. Donald Trump strained to get the issue into the debate, citing it in his hurried closing remarks before Lester Holt cut him off at the end.Republican senators had more time to grill Jeh Johnson on the issue. Sasse took the lead.""I'd have to check. I don't know sitting here right now, sir,"" Jeh Johnson said when Sasse asked him if any of the lucky illegals hailed from Syria, Iran, or Libya.""It's a knowable fact. I can get you the information. Sitting here right now, I don't have the list in front of me. And I don't want to be wrong,"" Johnson continued.

Comey made the admission while being interrogated Tuesday before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERComey faced pointed questions about recent terrorist shootings and bombings in the United States and about his failure to recommend indictment for Hillary Clinton in her private server scandal. Comey is under fire in the public for these failures, with Breitbart News recently reporting on his financial links to the Clinton Foundation.""Is it your position that no mistakes were made in each of these in judging them not to be credible threats?,"" Kentucky Senator Rand Paul asked Comey, referring to multiple instances of the FBI failing to act on evidence that it had on various terrorist suspects before they killed Americans. ""Would you not have done more in the gun store that Mateen came into six weeks before the shooting? Would you not have done more when Rahami was arrested in questioning him because his dad said he was a terrorist?""In a rare moment of candor, Comey made a stunning admission.""Thank you, Senator. Sitting before you is a deeply flawed and fallible human being who believes very strongly in admitting mistakes when they're made,"" Comey said. ""I hope you saw the very painful moment when I admitted publicly we made a mistake in allowing Dylan Roof to get a gun. So, as long as I'm director of the FBI we will stare back very carefully at what we do, and where we make mistakes we will admit them, and we will be transparent and we will get better.""""We are not perfect people,"" Comey conceded, noting that a pending inspector general investigation will help the FBI learn from its mistakes.""Yes, he was interviewed twice during a seven-month investigation,"" Comey told New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, referring to Omar Mateen. Asked if the FBI tracked Mateen's online activity, Comey said, ""I don't know the answer. I don't think so at this point.""Comey also detailed how he was out-maneuvered by top Clinton aide Cheryl Mills' lawyers during the Clinton email investigation.""The immunity was, we will not use, the Department of Justice, anything against you on this laptop,"" Comey said, on the subject of Mills being granted immunity. ""This was, in the negotiation, a tool to get the laptop.""""Well it's a lawyer's laptop,"" Comey said. ""By June of this year I wanted that laptop...

She did nothing during the debate to change the trajectory of those increasingly bleak polls.Mrs. Clinton's primary charge against Mr. Trump is that he lacks the ""temperament"" to be president. In an easy glide Monday night, Mr. Trump demonstrated otherwise.He was perfectly presidential, even if a bit unpolished at times -- just the way so many of his supporters love him. He was poised and even a bit mannerly at times.Perhaps a bit too mannerly. But we'll get to that.Mrs. Clinton failed to do anything that will change the overwhelming view of her that she is slick, calculating and out of touch. And her plastic smile and that practiced, canned laugh -- including a truly bizarre shoulder jiggle at one point -- will only feed the notion that she is not really all there.In addition, Mrs. Clinton failed to land any devastating punches on Mr. Trump. She landed a few potent shots about his tax proposals and his tax returns, but nothing extraordinary. And nothing anywhere near as withering as everything everybody in both parties and the media have already hurled at the guy. From the start, the debate was lively and fiery. That was not because of the moderator, and it certainly was not because Hillary Clinton was on stage. It was entirely owing to Mr. Trump's presence.Something about his swashbuckling manner always puts people off kilter a little, and the result always seems to be a debate that is more robust and honest -- if sometimes a bit imprecise.As for moderator Lester Holt, he will be excoriated in coming days for his multiple follow-up questions of Mr. Trump and his failure to ask even the most basic questions of Mrs. Clinton.She also used up a number of lines that she had obviously practice extensively -- to little effect.""I know you live in your own reality,"" she said at one point, but it was entirely lost in muddle.But here is where Mr. Trump has a lot of room to improve.Instead of simply prosecuting the case against Mrs. Clinton, he dutifully answered all of Mr. Holt's questions and responded to all of Mrs. Clinton's jabs -- no matter how silly.After successfully turning questions about his unreleased tax returns into questions about Hillary Clinton's 33,000 destroyed emails, Mr. Trump dutifully changed the subject back to his tax returns and spent far more time explaining that. Forget the tax returns and hammer away at the emails.One of his sharpest moments came when he repeatedly hammered her for an answer on whether the economy and bad trade deals was the fault of President Obama or former President Bill Clinton.In truth, that is the entire crux of his campaign and if he sticks with it, he will win.He is most effective when he is reminding people that Hillary Clinton has been around on the national political stage for the better part of three decades and only now offering to fix things.""Why are you just thinking of these solutions now?"" he asked in possibly his best line.A good runner-up was when he acknowledged that Mrs. Clinton has plenty of experience, ""but it's bad, bad experience.""The really good news for Donald Trump supporters is that if we have learned nothing else from this election, it is that Mr. Trump is a fast learner. He was very good in this debate. He will be even better in the next.* Charles Hurt can be reached at charleshurt@live.com; follow him on Twitter via @charleshurt.SIGN UP"

""Contemporary police killings and the trauma that they create are reminiscent of the past racial terror of lynching.""The panel said that the police shootings of African Americans during the past year have caused a ""human rights crisis"" that is in urgent need of addressing and compared the recent shootings to the acts of lynchings by white supremacists in the late 1800s.The group said the reparations could come in a variety of forms, such as ""a formal apology, health initiatives, educational opportunities, ... psychological rehabilitation, technology transfer and financial support, and debt cancellation.""Ricardo A. Sunga, one of the panel members who was asked about the presidential race in the United States, talked about ""hate speech ... xenophobia (and) Afrophobia"" prevalent in the race, but did not call out any candidates by name.The reparations, however, are unlikely to occur since the group's recommendations are non-binding and unlikely to influence policy in the United States.SIGN UP"

The poll of 906 likely voters has a margin of error of 3.3 percent.The Trump campaign in Minnesota is completely different Mitt Romney's 2012 effort, said the native of Minnesota, who joined the campaign and returned to the land of 10,000 lakes a little over a month ago after working in Washington for two years.""There are more grassroots, more volunteers, more Independents and more excitement this year,"" he said.In the 2012 election, President Barack Obama beat his GOP rival Romney with 52 percent of the vote to 43 percent for the former Massachusetts governor.Post said the Trump campaign has been outspent so far by a rate of at least 20-to-1, so the fact that the Trump campaign is having success closing the gap with the Clinton campaign is because his message is resonating and hers is not.""One thing that is really coming up is that the people of Minnesota have a real dislike of Hillary Clinton,"" he said.Outside the cities, the state's politics are still dominated by the legacy the Democratic Farm and Labor Party, Post said.The DFL is the merger between the left-progressive Farmer and Labor Party and the state's Democratic Party, the unified organization functions as the state's Democratic Party and it is most closely associated with man, who effected the merger, Hubert H.

The deal was not only rejected by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as an 'historic mistake,"" but has also provided hundreds of billions of dollars to an antisemitic regime bent on the destruction of the Jewish state and engaged in ongoing terrorism against Jewish communities throughout the world.The WJC did not like the question.""It's way too early for us to be discussing that at this time,"" said WJC spokesperson Aliyana Traison on Tuesday. ""We are not going to discuss that at this time. We're not answering questions about that. Thank you."" Traison also declined to comment on whether the award was appropriate given a string of public controversies between Biden and the current Israeli government.In 2010, Biden condemned Israel when a junior Israeli government official announced new plans for apartments in a Jewish neighborhood in East Jerusalem during Biden's visit to the country. Biden's comments triggered an international controversy that saw Secretary of State Hillary Clinton berate Netanyahu on the telephone for 45 minutes and caused the Palestinians to adopt more extreme demands before they would agree to peace negotiations.In April this year, Biden against set off another dispute with Israel when he told the radical left-wing J Street organization that Israel was heading in the ""wrong direction.""Theodor Herzl was the founder of modern Zionism and inspired the creation of the State of Israel. As a journalist during the Dreyfus Affair in France, Herzl was convinced by the antisemitism he saw that Jews needed a state in their historic homeland.The WSJ press release does not say what Biden did to earn the award.

Alberta officials asked for a Fish and Wildlife investigation into Bowmar's actions, to see if he did anything illegal.Fox 31 reported that the U.S. Humane Society compared Bowmar to the hunter who killed ""Cecil the Lion."" Now Maryland's Department of Natural Resources is seeking to ban the use of spears for ""big game"" hunting.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

Under the Public Health Code, only active TB is a mandatory reported condition in Michigan.Wheaton admits that the state does not maintain a database of latent TB infection rates among arriving refugees on an aggregate level.Breitbart News asked MDHHS for data on LTBI infection rates based on the entire population of refugees screened, not just the small group with B1, B2, and B3 notifications.""We do not have that data,"" MDHHS spokesperson Wheaton told Breitbart News.Breitbart News asked Elizabeth Yore, former ""General Counsel at the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services for 8 years and the General Counsel at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children"" to unravel these two competing views of the statutory requirements of the Refugee Act of 1980.Yore tells Breitbart News:The Refugee Act of 1980 specifically directs states to identify, treat and monitor refugees with medical conditions that affect the public health. Latent TB is a serious medical condition which requires treatment and monitoring to safeguard that the refugees are complying with medical treatment so that active and infectious TB does not manifest in the patient. The purpose of this section of Refugee Act is to ensure that potential infectious diseases are strictly monitored, treated, and contained. An outbreak of TB endangers the public health, safety and welfare of the State, and elsewhere.This is another potential Flint Water Crisis. By ignoring and flaunting the federal law which addresses the public health concerns of the State, the MDHHS is recklessly playing roulette with the public health and safety of its citizens. Such a imprudent and cavalier attitude toward public health appears to be endemic in Michigan. Apparently, Michigan health officials haven't learned that public health and safety demands the utmost vigilance and diligence for citizens, families and, especially children.By not monitoring and tracking latent TB infected refugees in Michigan, MDHHS is endangering public health and creating a new category of ""sanctuary states"" which are petri dishes for infectious diseases.The Refugee Act of 1980 was sponsored by the late Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-MA). It  specifies that information about individual refugees who test positive for latent tuberculosis infection is transmitted to local county health departments upon diagnosis.But Michigan resettlement agencies, including Samaritas (formerly known as Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service of Michigan), and contracted refugee health screening services, including the Arab American Chaldean Council (contracted by MDHHS to conduct refugee health screenings in Oakland, Macomb, and Wayne Counties), are not providing this legally required data to county health departments.Latent TB infection, poses a public health risk, as Breitbart News reported previously:The latent tuberculosis (TB) infection rate among arriving refugees arriving in the state of California during 2014 is at the lower end of all reporting states. Florida has a similar rate (12 percent), and Texas (15 percent) is slightly higher. At the highest end are Vermont (35 percent) and Tennessee (27 percent).Many states, however, fail to collect or report either latent TB infection rates or the number of active TB cases diagnosed among recently resettled refugees.High latent TB infection rates among resettled refugees pose a public health risk of active TB in communities in which they live, according to a 2013 study from the University of California at San Diego.The latent TB infection rate among the general population is about four percent.California is just one of seven states that appear to be fully compliant with the refugee health reporting and monitoring standards specified by the Refugee Act of 1980. The other compliant states are Texas, Florida, Minnesota, Utah, Indiana, and Arizona.But the state of Michigan refuses to acknowledge that latent TB infection is a public health risk, as defined by the Refugee Act of 1980.As Breitbart News reported previously, 19 refugees have been diagnosed with active TB in Michigan during the past six years. The state does not know what percentage of recently resettled refugees test positive for latent TB infection, and, the attorney familiar with the federal refugee resettlement program tells Breitbart News, it should know and report that information to the public.Attorney Elizabeth Yore agrees. ""Michigan parents, out of an abundance of concern for the health of their children, should demand from MDHHS a system of intensive tracking and monitoring of latent and active TB cases of resettled refugees.""Breitbart News asked MDHHS spokesperson Wheaton if he consulted with legal counsel prior to asserting the Refugee Act of 1980 does not apply to Michigan's reporting and monitoring requirements.""I consulted with appropriate MDHHS staff with the appropriate expertise to answer your questions,"" Wheaton responds.When informed that attorneys familiar with the Refugee Act of 1980 tell Breitbart News that MDHHS staff are wrong on the law, Wheaton brushed that news off.""Thanks for the opportunity, but our initial response should suffice for us. I'll look forward to seeing who the attorneys are and what they have to say,"" he said.The attorney familiar with the federal refugee resettlement program says that is a huge problem.""Under the Refugee Act of 1980, refugee resettlement contractors are required to 'assure that refugees, known to the agency as having been identified . . . as having medical conditions affecting the public health and requiring treatment [such as active and latent TB], report to the appropriate county or other health agency upon their resettlement in an area.' See (8 US Code 1522 (4) (B) (D) and (7) (C)),"" an attorney familiar with the federal refugee resettlement program tells Breitbart News.""Nor have they monitored the health status of refugees so identified, also a requirement of the Refugee Act of 1980,"" the attorney adds.""At the very least, MDHHS should be aware of the CDC guidelines, which the Michigan Advisory Committee for Elimination of TB cited in its 2012 recommendations,"" the attorney notes.""The CDC has established guidelines for the domestic evaluation of newly-arrived refugees for TB, "" the recommendations note, with a link to the CDC domestic evaluation of refugees for TB which says among other things:The primary goal of the domestic refugee medical screening evaluation for TB is to identify individuals with latent TB infection (LTBI) or TB disease, to facilitate timely treatment and control.The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services has a rocky recent past.Earlier this month a former state epidemiologist pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for actions related to the Flint public water drinking crisis.As the Detroit Free Press reported:A former director with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services pleaded no contest today to a misdemeanor charge in the Flint water crisis.As part of the plea deal reached with Corinne Miller, the former director of the Bureau of Disease Control, Prevention and Epidemiology, two felonies were dismissed, including misconduct in office. She pleaded no contest to willful neglect of duty by a public officer. As part of the agreement, Miller, who retired from the department in 2016, must cooperate with the Michigan Attorney General Office's investigation into the water crisis and provide truthful testimony.""I wouldn't have put this deal together unless we knew what she could do,"" Todd Flood, the lawyer spearheading the prosecutions, said after the hearing. He declined to elaborate.The plea agreement includes references to ""Suspect 1"" and ""Suspect 2,"" and says Miller was asked in January 2015 to provide a report about an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in the Flint area that started after the city changed its water supply from Lake Huron to the Flint River. She gave both people information about it, court documents say, but officials haven't revealed the identities of the two people.Miller, who didn't speak in court other than to briefly answer questions from the judge, is the second defendant to reach a plea deal among the nine charged in connection with Attorney General Bill Schuette's investigation.Though officials with the MDHHS and resettlement agencies appear to be unconcerned about serious legal arguments presented that they are failing to comply with the Refugee Act of 1980, Oakland Michigan County Executive L. Brooks Patterson has a different view.Last week, Patterson said Oakland County intends to sue the federal government and ask for a temporary injunction that will immediately stop the flow of more than 1,000 refugees a year into Oakland County, on grounds that the health reporting and monitoring requirements, as well as the consultation requirements of the Refugee Act of 1980 are being violated.MDHHS has contracts in place so refugees can receive a health screening within 90 days of their date of entry into the U.S. However, latent TB is not a reportable condition under the Public Health Code and treatment is determined by the physician. Under the Public Health Code, only active TB is a mandatory reported condition in Michigan.The Refugee Act of 1980 specifically directs states to identify, treat and monitor refugees with medical conditions that affect the public health.

The purpose of this section of Refugee Act is to ensure that potential infectious diseases are strictly monitored, treated, and contained.

Many states, however, fail to collect or report either latent TB infection rates or the number of active TB cases diagnosed among recently resettled refugees.
High latent TB infection rates among resettled refugees pose a public health risk of active TB in communities in which they live, according to a 2013 study from the University of California at San Diego.
The latent TB infection rate among the general population is about four percent.

Some explicitly called for Holt to ""fact-check"" Trump -- the implication being that Trump is more ignorant or dishonest -- and implied that he would face the same fate as NBC's Matt Lauer and Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon, both of whom were slammed by liberal media critics for the crime of treating both candidates fairly.Moreover, most of Holt's questions prompts were overly friendly to Clinton's point of view, while hostile to Trump. In one of the last exchanges of the debate, for example, Holt strongly implied Trump was a sexist when asking about a past criticism he had made about Clinton lacking a ""presidential look."" He also introduced the opening topic of the debate by praising Obama's economic performance, ignoring the fact that growth never reached 3% under Obama and labor force participation has fallen.Breitbart News noted that Holt intervened several times to ""fact-check"" Trump -- often erroneously -- while never checking Clinton's facts, even when she was completely wrong, as in her claim that she had never flip-flopped on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. In addition, the Washington Examiner's Eddie Scarry notes Holt asked Trump six follow-up questions, and none of Clinton, leaving Trump ""having to debate the highly anticipated event's moderator as well as his Democratic opponent.""Joel B.

I work in the national security area, and I think it's important to serve the government, and have the government do the right things if you can help them in those areas. For me, politics - in a very old-fashioned way - kind of stops at the water's edge.He added, ""But we're in a very complex and difficult situation now, I think, and although I advise the Trump campaign on national security matters, obviously if I'm an adviser, I'll get into some of these other issues a bit, too.""He said he thought Trump did a good job on dissecting the Iran nuclear deal:He's right, absolutely, I think on the issue.

He needs to confidently talk about some of these issues and give people the - I think accurate - perception that he would be a good leader in a crisis, or in a serious mess of some kind, because he's dealt with them all his life. And Hillary would not."

He singled out the Democrat approach to policing-which excludes ""stop and frisk"" while substituting gun control in its place. The climate created by such an approach has been on display in Chicago during Obama's presidency and has begun shattering records for gun violence during 2016.The Washington Post published a transcript of the debate, in which Trump said:We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he'll because it's so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot.In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st. Thousands of shootings. And I'm saying, where is this? Is this a war-torn country? What are we doing? And we have to stop the violence. We have to bring back law and order. In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over -- almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed.""Almost 4,000."" Have nearly that many lives been taken in cold blood in one city under Obama's watch?ABC 7 reported approximately 453 homicides in Chicago in 2009, the Chicago Tribune reported 431 in 2010 and approximately 423 in 2011. CBS 5 reports that ""Chicago was the nation's murder capital in 2012,"" with over 500 homicides. Chicago's STMW reported 415 murders in 2013 and Time magazine reported 416 in 2o14. And BET reported ""over 500"" homicides in Chicago in 2015. The Tribune reports there have already been 550 homicides this year, with three months left to go. That brings the total number of murders in Chicago to approximately 3,700-or ""almost 4,000"" under Obama's watch.Trump's solution to this massive loss of life is stop and frisk coupled with policing that ""[takes] the gun away from criminals who shouldn't be having it."" He also wants protections that ensure law-abiding blacks and Hispanics can have the guns they need for defense of themselves and their families. Hillary Clinton rejected stop and frisk during the debate and pushed even more gun control as a solution to the failures of gun control in Chicago and elsewhere.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

""There were so many aspects of both national security [and] pay-for-play. The idea that that didn't get discussed or come up was sort of a real disservice.""""He didn't ask about her emails,"" Spicer added in disbelief. ""He said, 'Is there anything you would like to add?' I mean, it was unbelievable.""Gov. Mike Huckabee's daughter Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who serves as one of Trump's senior advisers, also spoke to Breitbart News about the omission of a question about the Clinton Foundation.""I thought Lester Holt had a really tough job tonight, but that was one of the few places I felt like he really had a couple of key issues he went after Trump on and ignored some of the big things -- they called it the dirty laundry debate,"" Sanders explained to Breitbart News. ""Frankly, Hillary Clinton should have been asked those questions and I think it was a real problem for him tonight to go after Trump on certain things and to leave that out for her.""The omission of a question about the Clinton Foundation comes after the Associated Press reported that more than 85 of the 154 people that met with Clinton during her time as secretary of state were Clinton Foundation donors.""More than half the people outside the government who met with Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state gave money -- either personally or through companies or groups -- to the Clinton Foundation,"" the Associated Press uncovered last month, adding,""It's an extraordinary proportion indicating her possible ethics challenges if elected president.""Sanders also criticized Clinton's response to a question on cyber security.""It's laughable that Hillary Clinton would even open her mouth to discuss cyber security,"" Sanders jabbed. ""She has zero credibility on this issue and frankly, she should be embarrassed to even talk about it given the amount of scandal and problems she's had on that [...] issue herself.""Trump's senior communications advisor Jason Miller stopped short of criticizing Holt for not asking about the Clinton Foundation, but he suggested there will be more evidence that comes out about Clinton's scandals regarding her use of a private email server as secretary of state and the Clinton Foundation.""I think that Secretary Clinton is someone who has had five former employees and consultants now take the 5th Amendment -- five -- that's a lot,"" Miller told Breitbart News in the spin room after Monday's debate.He continued:You don't take immunity if you did nothing wrong. So clearly, we have the deleted emails, we have a foundation that was basically set up so they could and profit -- enrich themselves -- and also so they could turn the office of secretary of state into a big mess and pay-for-play racket. We saw this in a study that over half of the people that came into met with her while she was secretary of state was a donor. I think that's really problematic.""American voters realize that there's something up with Secretary Clinton. You wouldn't have five different people taking immunity deals if there wasn't something wrong,"" Miller added.You don't take immunity if you did nothing wrong.

What we need is to coerce the Syrian regime into implementing international resolutions.""He said that the current US administration is mainly good at talking. ""Mouthing slogans is all that it does,"" he said. ""We hope that the next one will be a lot more serious than the current one, which did nothing to see through the implementation of UN resolutions.""He said that the Syrian opposition has been in contact with the presidential candidates. ""The candidates, especially Clinton, who served as secretary of state when the Syrian crisis erupted, have a clear position about what's going on in Syria. The other candidate also talks about implementing UN resolutions and the need to reach stability, which will not be reached unless the regime is ousted.""Asked whether a Clinton victory will bode well for the opposition, Hijab said that ""our hope lies mainly in the Syrian people and the fighters on the ground. We hope the new administration will show more resolve, as the president didn't utter a word about Syria in his address before the United Nations General Assembly, even though it is clearly the most burning international issue currently on the table.""Hijab also said that the US refused to allow the opposition to review an agreement it reached with Russia. ""At first they refused, but eventually they handed it over. We realized that the version we saw was incomplete, and we submitted many queries to them.""SIGN UP"
