Ileana Ros-Lehtinen.""The upcoming resolution at the World Heritage Committee is every bit as divisive as the Executive Board resolution, despite Jerusalem's inscription as a holy city for Judaism, Christianity and Islam on UNESCO's World Heritage list,"" the letter read.The letter warned that such attempts at denying Jewish and Christian history would only ""damage the prospects of peace between Israel and the Palestinians,"" and called on the committee's 21 member states ""to respect and protect the religious, cultural, and historical significance of Jerusalem and to uphold the values and ideals enshrined in UNESCO's Constitution.""Cruz said the resolution was another ""pernicious effort to delegitimize Israel"" and urged members to ""vote against this resolution that attempts to rewrite thousands of years of Jerusalem's Jewish identity, which has been scientifically reaffirmed by the archaeological record.""In an oped for the Washington Times, Cruz took President Barack Obama to task for allowing the resolution to be passed in the first place, slamming the president for putting ""his political legacy over the national security interests of the United States -- which would be a secure and sovereign Israel.""""America should be rallying our friends and allies to oppose these insidious UNESCO resolutions that attempt to undermine the historic connection of the Israeli people with all of their country, including their capital, Jerusalem,"" Cruz wrote.Ros-Lehtinen criticized ""the continued hypocrisy and repeated attempts by UNESCO members to distort the truth"" and lambasted the organization's members' efforts ""to attack the Jewish State, the only country to respect religious freedom in a region beset by religious violence.""She accused the UN at large for having an ""anti-Israel agenda"" that seeks ""to delegitimize and isolate the Jewish State.""The other signatories to the letter are by Sens.

Texas is the thirteenth state to withdrawn from the federal program, effective in January. Two additional states, Vermont and Massachusetts, allow the federal government to resettle refugees within their boundaries under the Wilson Fish alternative program, but have not withdrawn from the federal program.In April, as the Thomas More Law Center statement notes,""the Tennessee General Assembly, by overwhelming majorities in both the House and Senate, passed Senate Joint Resolution 467 (""SJR 467"") during the 2016 legislative session. The Resolution authorized legal action to stop the federal government's violation of the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution because it impermissibly commandeers state funds to finance a federal program.""""At issue is state sovereignty. Our rights and responsibilities under the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Tennessee Constitution are at stake. We seek a declaration of these rights. Indifference to our constitutional rights is indifference to our duty. We are not indifferent,"" State Senator Mark Norris (R-Collierville), who took the lead in writing and introducing the resolution, said.""Of all the legislation that I have worked on, this by far is the most important. The only way we can get back to our Constitutional Beginnings and the intent birthed by our Founding Fathers, is to go and take it back. We are looking forward to linking arms with the Thomas More Law Firm for the long haul to regain sovereignty for our great state,"" State Rep. Terri Lynn Weaver (R-Lancaster) who championed the resolution in the House, said.Richard Thompson, president and chief counsel of the Thomas More Law Center, said he was pleased to represent the state of Tennessee in the litigation.""It's an honor to represent the state of Tennessee on this significant constitutional issue. Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts observed, 'The States are separate and independent sovereigns. Sometimes they have to act like it.' We intend to follow that advice on behalf of Tennessee in our lawsuit,"" Thompson said.After Senate Joint Resolution 467 was passed by the Tennessee House and the Tennessee Senate, Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey (Speaker of the Senate) and Tennessee House Speaker Beth Harwell appointed two members of the Senate and two members of the House to implement the resolution.State Senator Mark Norris and State Senator John Stevens (R-Huntingdon) represented the State Senate, and Rep. William Lamberth (R-Cottontown) and Rep. Terri Lynn Weaver represented the Tennessee House.""I look forward to working with the Thomas More Law Center as we pursue a Judicial remedy to this issue that will ensure the safety and security of all Tennesseans, "" Lamberth said.In its statement, the Thomas More Law Center said it "" intends to advance a legal claim of first impression to challenge federal refugee resettlement programs operating in states which have formally withdrawn from participation in the federal refugee resettlement program, but are nevertheless still forced by federal regulations to pay state taxpayer dollars to finance programs administered by private organizations.""Currently, state funds that could otherwise be used for state programs are in effect appropriated by the federal government to support refugee resettlement rather than to support Tennesseans. This arrangement displaces Tennessee's constitutionally mandated funding prerogatives and appropriations process.In FY 2016, 1,956 of the 85,000 refugees resettled in the United States were resettled in Tennessee, according to the Department of State's interactive website.Five hundred and thirty-one refugees arrived from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 309 from Iraq, 246 from Syria, and 236 from Somalia.In the first twenty-four days of October, 186 refugees have been resettled in Tennessee, which, on an annualized basis would result in the resettlement of 2,828 refugees in the state during FY 2017.The Tennessee Office for Refugees, a subsidiary of Catholic Charities of Tennessee, operates the refugee resettlement program in Tennessee on behalf of the federal government.The Center for Immigration Studies recently estimated that refugees cost taxpayers in the state of Tennessee $165 million annually in unfunded federal mandates. Among those expenses are payments made by the state to cover health expenses of refugees, including those treated for active and latent tuberculosis (TB).As Breitbart News reported previously, 27 percent of refugees who arrived in Tennessee during the five year period from 2011 to 2015 tested positive for latent TB infection.Two cases of multi-drug resistant TB were diagnosed among refugees resettled in Tennessee over the past three years.Neither the Tennessee Department of Health nor the Tennessee Office for Refugees have released data on the total number of refugees resettled in Tennessee who have been diagnosed with active TB.As Breitbart News reported previously, 304 refugees have been diagnosed with active TB in fifteen states over the past six years.Currently, state funds that could otherwise be used for state programs are in effect appropriated by the federal government to support refugee resettlement rather than to support Tennesseans.

""However, I wouldn't abolish the National Security Agency, but I would re-direct its satellites away from us, American citizens,"" Johnson told the audience, while listing the government agencies, including the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Commerce, or Homeland Security, that he would abolish, in some cases returning their functions to the FBI or other agencies.Johnson criticized Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, calling Trump ""such a nasty man,"" and saying neither had addressed the costs of the drug war or the need for entitlement reform. Asked about Evan McMullen, an independent candidate who is only on 11 state ballots, but is threatening to win his home state of Utah, beating Clinton, Trump, and Johnson, Governor Johnson said ""more power to him.""If not elected, Johnson, a triathlete who has climbed most of the world's great mountains, said his plans include skiing 120 days in 2017 and leading a biking group down the continental divide bike trail from Banff, Canada to New Mexico.""I won't be running again, this is my swan song,"" Johnson, 63, told Hohman.  ""But I will probably still be involved in the Libertarian Party, which is growing and becoming a force to be reckoned with.""  Johnson also answered questions about places were his campaign themes had not matched up with the Libertarian Party's platform.""I'm growing to like the Libertarian Party more and more,"" said one writer for the libertarian magazine Reason in the audience, opining that it has become more serious than in previous elections.""Gary is getting better at interviews,"" said Johnson supporter Marta Howard, a music teacher from Vienna, Virginia.  One executive from the libertarian CATO Institute in the audience joked that the whole election was ""a march into the abyss.""""I think Gary blew away a great chance because he didn't care enough to communicate his candidacy better.

""End the media's corrupt collusion with extremist liberals who silence dissent and persecute religious believers."" The TV spot also accuses Clinton of promoting federal war on police officers, Catholics and Scriptural Christians, the U.S. military, and small businesses, among other things.

The ad, rather than placing the blame on the talent, explains how these media bosses are driving out the good, objective reporters, only to replace them with people who are like themselves or individuals with little to no journalistic experience and who can be turned into their puppets.Three specific examples the ad shows about media bosses suppressing reporters include how the New York Times literally yanked and rewrote a piece about an IRS scandal that made the Obama administration look bad; NBC's thwarting of veteran investigative reporter Lisa Meyers when she tried to expose the unsavory truth about the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare); and CBS shutting down Sharyl Attkinsson for her attempt to expose the Benghazi scandal which resulted in the loss of four American lives, including that of U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens.

Mike Pence took the stage to rally North Carolina supporters for the Trump-Pence ticket, a woman in a BBQ joint shared the story of her recently passed father who, at the age of 79, had never voted in his life but was going to vote for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump if he lived long enough.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEREdward Holbrook passed away in March. His daughter Ann Chandler and her daughter Gayle Holbrook decided to visit well known old fashioned barbecue restaurant Stameys in Greensboro, North Carolina. The women were surprised when Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence walked in with his family, and Pence and Chandler met.Chandler told Pence of her father and, although he had passed away before the election, he was going to make Trump the first person he voted for.Directly after speaking with Pence, Chandler told Breitbart News, ""My father passed away March 3. He had never voted. If he had made it until the election, he said he was going to vote for Trump.""She characterized her dad's opinion of politicians and why he hadn't voted his whole life thus: ""I think he thought they were all pretty much talk.""""He believed that Trump would do what he says,"" Chandler said of her father. ""He's the smartest man we ever knew. He didn't conform. So we're trying to spread the word.""Chandler said that with Trump in the race, even her 23-year-old son watched the debate. She added that he doesn't ever watch that sort of thing.Of her meeting with Pence, Chandler said she thinks he means what he says.When minutes later Pence took the stage at the Greensboro rally to the raucous applause of the crowd, he told them of the woman he had just met and the story of her dear father. ""If anybody ever come along worth voting for, he'd register and he'd vote,"" Pence told the audience. ""And she said, my dad passed away in March, but our whole family's supporting Donald Trump because my dad was going to vote for Donald Trump.""Chandler later told Breitbart News that she recalled watching news with her father as Trump campaigned and he said, ""He's getting them all stirred up; you go get 'em, Trump.""Pence made a stop at Stameys barbecue just before the rally. He visited with 30-40 people. One family clapped from the back of the restaurant and later told Pence that the young one of the family was knocking on lots of doors for Trump. Another man sitting down to dinner with his wife said that they had voted just that day. He said he has been a Republican since 1981 and voted for Trump, but he's working on his wife who is a Democrat.Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton remain neck and neck in North Carolina polls, according to a RealClearPolitics average.

Those following the program must acknowledge their powerlessness over alcohol and their dependence upon God to restore them to health.In the third step, for instance, members ""Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him."" In the seventh step, they ""Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.""Although Alcoholics Anonymous allows atheists and agnostics to participate in the organization and its meetings, they have balked at reformulating the Twelve Steps to exclude all reference to God, which they believe to be an integral part of the healing process. The organization has disassociated itself from atheist groups such as Beyond Belief and We Agnostics that have gone ahead and changed traditional AA language in their formulation of the Twelve Steps.Last year, 58-year-old Lawrence Knight, one of the founders of Beyond Belief, took AA to the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal, claiming that the words ""God"" and ""Higher Power"" are outdated, and that for some the word ""God"" creates negative associations and may even be ""triggering.""In the Agnostic AA Preamble on Beyond Belief's website, his group expresses its vision of the new direction AA should take.This group of A.A. attempts to maintain a tradition of free expression, and conduct a meeting where alcoholics may feel free to express any doubts or disbeliefs they may have, and to share their own personal form of spiritual experience, their search for it, or their rejection of it. We do not endorse or oppose any form of religion or atheism. Our only wish is to assure suffering alcoholics that they can find sobriety in A.A. without having to accept anyone else's beliefs or having to deny their own.Knight wants AA to adopt a modified version of its Steps, expunging references to a divinity, so that all can feel included.Some of the more hardcore atheists in the group, however, have even taken issue with the modified Steps, claiming that they don't go far enough in eliminating unpleasant language regarding spirituality and meditation.One member, identified as Richard H., said that there is rampant confusion about what the word spirituality means, but above all objects to the implication of the existence of something unseen, a concept he finds ""unpalatable.""On November 18, all parties will reportedly sit down for mediation in an attempt to avoid going to court. If mediation fails, contested hearings will likely follow, with the future status of AA hanging in the balance.Follow Thomas D.

It's important to maintain confidence in the relationship,"" he said.The official Saudi Press Agency reported that Prince Mohammed and Votel discussed defence cooperation and joint efforts in ""combatting terrorism"".An October 8 air strike on a funeral ceremony in Yemen's rebel-held capital Sanaa which killed more than 140 people, most of them civilians, sparked a storm of criticism of both Saudi Arabia and its US ally.In response, the US National Security Council announced that commanders had begun a review ""of our already significantly reduced support to the Saudi-led coalition and are prepared to adjust our support so as to better align with US principles, values and interests.""In the summer, Washington cut the number of advisers deployed to a joint planning cell from 45 to five but the US Air Force stills provides air-to-air refuelling for Saudi bombers operating over Yemen.The frictions over the air war in Yemen come with relations already strained.Riyadh was angered by the US Congress's passage last month of a law allowing the families of 9/11 victims to sue the kingdom for alleged ties to the 2001 attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people. Saudi officials vehemently deny any involvement.The kingdom has also been alarmed by US moves to improve relations with its bitter regional rival Iran through a landmark nuclear deal last year.SIGN UPRIYADH (AFP) - "

Egypt's police force largely melted away on the fourth day of the 18-day uprising, when police stations were stormed and thousands of inmates broke out from a number of prisons.His comments, however, are the latest warning by officials and pro-government media against what they say are calls by the Brotherhood for street demonstrations on Nov. 11 to protest against prices rises and other economic woes. There has been no reliable evidence that the Brotherhood was specifically behind the call for protests next month, although the group continues to encourage anti-government protests.In an Oct. 14 statement posted on its website, the Brotherhood urges Egyptians to rise up and topple al-Sissi's government, but gives no specific date for the demonstrations it is calling for.Al-Sissi appeared to refer to these planned protests when, in a meeting with government leaders Saturday, he urged authorities to be on high alert and beef up the defense of vital state installations. The meeting came just hours after a senior Egyptian army officer was gunned down outside his home in an eastern Cairo suburb.A little-known group with suspected links to the Brotherhood claimed responsibility for the brazen daylight attack.Al-Sissi's government has already shown sensitivity to signs of a popular backlash over the economy. The presidency has issued near-daily statements saying al-Sissi is instructing ministers to ensure the availability of basic staples at affordable prices and to prosecute any merchants found to be hoarding food supplies.The perceived fears come as shortages and rising food prices are feeding discontent among Egyptians, who are also enduring new taxes and a hike in utility bills. The government must also introduce a package of economic reforms, including the devaluation of the pound and lifting fuel subsidies, to secure a $12-billion dollar loan from the International Monetary Fund to bail out Egypt's ailing economy.Egypt is suffering an acute foreign currency shortage because of the decimation of its lucrative tourism industry, a fall in Suez Canal revenues and reduced remittances from Egyptian expatriates. It also suffers from double digit rates of inflation and unemployment.Its economic crisis comes as Egypt's security forces are battling an Islamic militant insurgency in the Sinai Peninsula.SIGN UP"

But after the Islamic State fighters fled and Iraqi troops didn't appear, their tiny supply of food quickly ran out, and the family had to flee to search for territory firmly under government control.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERWhen the Mosul offensive began a week ago, departing IS fighters warned villagers to stay off the roads and surrounding fields, which the militants had mined. So Khalaf waited until she saw a passing shepherd, and then she and her family made the eight-hour walk out of no man's land behind a herd of sheep.""We were starving,"" she said. They had watched the start of the offensive on TV and thought Iraqi forces were on the way, but the troops' progress has been slow, and Mosul's southern approach is littered with dozens of villages, some with no more than 20 homes.Eventually, Khalaf couldn't produce enough breast milk for her infant daughter. ""I started giving her goat's milk, but then the goat died,"" she said.Mosul, the largest city controlled by the Islamic State group, is still home to more than 1 million civilians. The government and international aid groups fear that a sudden mass exodus will overwhelm the few camps set up on its outskirts.The massive offensive is expected to take weeks, if not months, and with supply routes cut off by the fighting, many civilians may not be able to stay in place for long. Driven by fear or hunger, many are already putting themselves in grave danger and are complicating the campaign to expel the militants from the city, which fell to IS in 2014.More than 5,600 people have already fled areas near Mosul, according to the International Organization for Migration, with most heading through IS-run territory toward the Syrian border, rather than in the direction of the advancing troops, who are converging from the north, east and south.Camps have been set up to accommodate 60,000 people, but about 200,000 are expected to be displaced in the first weeks of the offensive, according to the Norwegian Refugee Council.Both the Iraqi government and Kurdish authorities are mired in an economic crisis brought on by low oil prices and say they do not have the resources to care for such a large number of displaced people. So they have urged everyone to stay put.""We have a comprehensive plan for the evacuation of the civilians,"" said Maj. Gen. Qassim al-Maliki, the head of the Iraqi army's 9th Division. ""The plan is to keep them in their houses until it becomes safer.""That means huddling indoors, often with no electricity or running water, as explosions and gunfire echo outside. Those living near the front lines are often out of reach of aid groups.Those who somehow manage to cross the battle lines, like Khalaf's family, face other challenges.The Kurds have taken in hundreds of thousands of people, but Sunni Arabs, who make up most of Mosul's population, are viewed with suspicion. When IS militants attacked the Kurdish-controlled city of Kirkuk last week, a senior Kurdish commander immediately speculated the attackers had infiltrated the city disguised as fleeing civilians.""Many of (the displaced civilians), I'm sure they are working with ISIS,"" said Kemal Kerkuki, a commander with the Kurdish forces, known as peshmerga. He said his forces arrested one recently who confessed to being part of a sleeper cell.""I have told the authorities many times to open a big camp and put all of (the people fleeing IS) there so we can control them,"" he said.In past operations against IS, Iraqi security forces have been accused of abuses of civilians fleeing militant-held territory. Iraqi armed groups ""have committed serious human rights violations, including war crimes, by torturing, arbitrarily detaining, forcibly disappearing and extrajudicially executing thousands of civilians,"" the human rights group Amnesty International reported this month.Fatima Abdullah, whose husband was detained for security screening at the Dibaga Camp this month after they fled their village near Mosul, said she understands the need for a vetting process. ""I don't blame them, it's their right,"" she said.""They are treating us well here,"" Abdullah said as some of her older children lined up to receive a hot evening meal in the school yard where they have been staying. ""But we're also scared. We don't know what our destiny is.""When Khalaf and her family arrived in Qayara after following the sheep out of their village, she was exhausted and her children were hungry. Two of her young daughters ate handfuls of stale rice from a pile of food that had been discarded on the side of the road. Another child started to scream and cry, begging to return home.""I just keep telling them all day, 'Don't worry. We're almost there,'"" she said.SIGN UP"

Afterward, the United States broke off those bilateral talks with Russia, accusing Moscow of not living up to its commitments.The two countries have since focused on multilateral talks that include other countries affected by the conflict.SIGN UP"

He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to media,Major General Sher Afgan, chief of the paramilitary Frontier Corps, told reporters Tuesday that the attackers appeared to be in contact with handlers in Afghanistan. He said the attackers belonged to the banned Lashker-e-Jhangvi Al-Almi group, an Islamic militant group affiliated with al-Qaeda.Neither Lashker-a-Jhangvi nor any other group has claimed responsibility for the attack. But the Islamic State group and breakaway Taliban faction Jamaat-ul Ahrar have claimed responsibility for past attacks in Baluchistan. Lashker-e-Jhangvi has mainly targeted members of minority Shiite sect of Muslims.The attack started when between four and six gunmen opened fire as they rushed the hostel at the police training center in a suburban area of the provincial capital of Quetta.""They were rushing toward our building firing shots so we rushed for safety toward the roof and jumped down in the back to save our lives,"" one of the police trainees told Geo television.Security was tight Tuesday morning around the training center and hospitals.Haq, the top health official, said many of the trainees were killed when the gunmen detonated explosive vests. He said the death toll was expected to climb as many of the injured were in critical condition.General Afgan said the attackers may have had inside help, although he did not give details. ""This is an open war and when you have enemy inside and outside, they can easily exploit the situation,"" he said.He said the security forces and police were clearing the area and searching for any possible hidden attackers.Baluchistan has been the scene of a low-intensity insurgency by Baluch separatist groups for more than a decade. Islamic militants also have a presence in the province that borders Afghanistan.The provincial home minister, Sarfaraz Bugti, said one attacker was killed by security forces and two died when they detonated their explosive vests.He said that about 700 trainees were at the base when it was attacked.Baluchistan police chief Ahsan Mahboob told reporters that four gunmen attacked the training center, attempting to enter the hostel housing the trainees. A gun battle erupted when the guards resisted, he said.A statement issued by the military put the number of attackers at up to six.Footage shot by local television showed ambulances rushing out of the main entrance of the training center as fire engines rushed to put out fires set off when the gunmen threw incendiary devices.Most of those being treated at city hospitals had gunshot wounds, although some sustained injuries jumping off the roof of the hostel and climbing a wall to escape the gunmen. Nearly all of the wounded were police, authorities said.Local television reported that two explosions were heard, but it was not immediately clear what caused them.Violence is common in the province, and the attack came hours after gunmen shot and killed two customs officers and wounded a third near the town of Surab, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) south of Quetta.Earlier Monday, two gunmen on a motorcycle killed a police intelligence officer in the country's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, said Khalid Khan, a local police officer.The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for that attack. The group's spokesman, Muhammad Khurasani, said in a statement that the shooters returned to their hideout after the attack.Pakistan has carried out military operations against militants in tribal areas near Afghanistan and in cities across Pakistan, but extremists are still capable of staging regular attacks.SIGN UP"

It is not a surprise or news now that he did this at the time. Breitbart News featured these interviews live on the website and on this network's SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 radio program at the time. Gold wrote:A liberal activist and organizer coordinated with reporters from the conservative news site Breitbart during the primaries to cover his disruptions of events for candidates such as Sen. Marco Rubio. Aaron Black, an associate with Democracy Partners and a former Occupy Wall Street organizer, worked with the pro-Trump site Breitbart, tipping it off about his stunts, exchanging raw video and coordinating coverage, according to a source with direct knowledge of the situation.The idea that Black ""coordinated"" Breitbart News coverage is a blatant misrepresentation of what happened. Black did on occasion--as he and any other effective organizer in politics does with everyone in media--tell Breitbart News about planned events he had coming up and different newsworthy actions he planned to take. Sometimes, when editors and reporters here deemed them newsworthy, Breitbart News would cover them. Other times not. For the reporters and editors at Politico who don't understand, that is what is called journalism.If anything, Black is a solid source with actionable intelligence on newsworthy events about many different goings-on in the political arena--and we're proud he has trusted us enough to work with us on a number of stories, including his work as Robot Rubio exposing the globalist Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL). Rubio, of course, would go on after this to lose the Republican presidential primaries badly to current GOP nominee Donald J. Trump as voters rejected his vision for the country by the millions.[Update: Democracy Partners challenged Politico's characterization of this interaction, as well. Gold has updated her story with a statement from the group:In an email Democracy Partners denied that Black worked directly with the Breitbart team.""Some Democracy Partners staff worked with groups that gave voice to the majority of Americans left out of the extreme conservative agenda of the Republican Party Presidential Primaries,"" the group said in a statement.Black, Democracy Partners said, ""disseminated information about the whereabouts of demonstrations and rapid response events to media outlets.""""The coalition demonstrated against all 17 of the Republican candidates,"" the statement continued. ""We engaged the media from across the political spectrum. When we organized events aimed at a Trump opponent, Breitbart was more than happy to spread the word. When we organized events against Mr. Trump, Breitbart amplified the Trump Foundation-funded con artist James O'Keefe, who attacked our firm and coalition.""]But that's beside the point of this story, in which specifically Politico accuses Breitbart News--and Black--inaccurately of ""coordination."" At no time did Breitbart News reporters or editors, including myself, tell or suggest to Black what to do--he was going to do what he was going to do--we just covered the news. And we did so ahead of the rest of the media in many cases on what turned out to be some of the more newsworthy stories of the Republican presidential primaries and beyond.Those facts didn't stop Politico from falsely smearing Black and Breitbart News in their story, though, with the suggestion that this news network was somehow behind what he did. That's an insult to the journalists at Breitbart News -- which was clearly at the cutting edge during the primaries, -- and it's an insult to Black's activism, which was clearly effective for his cause.""According to the source, Black coordinated with Breitbart via email, phone and in person, including when he dressed up as a robot and trolled Marco Rubio's events,"" Gold wrote. ""The relationship was described as very friendly. An article subsequently published on Breitbart featured video footage of a physical confrontation between Black and Rubio's New Hampshire campaign chairman.""In that section, there are a few half-truths in Gold's article. First off, Breitbart News did cover the incident of Robot Rubio--Aaron Black--getting physically confronted by Rubio staffer Cliff Hurst. Hurst, Rubio's state director in New Hampshire, manhandled Black--who was wearing a robot costume to poke fun at Rubio's horrendous debate performance in an exchange with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie--in the video.What Gold doesn't say, however, is who actually pushed the story to Breitbart News. Black did not have a hand in pushing this particular story. Breitbart News can reveal here for the first time that it was a paid staffer--whose identity this network will protect, because Breitbart News believes in journalism--for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's campaign that first flagged the incident for Breitbart News and sent the video to Breitbart News.""Here is the video,"" the Jeb Bush staffer said in an email to Breitbart News, with a link to the YouTube clip of Hurst bashing Black.""The guy in the green jacket that puts the kid in a head lock (assault) is this guy. Cliff Hurst. He is [Rubio's] state chairman,"" the Jeb Bush staffer added with a link to a WMUR story detailing how Hurst used to work for fellow failed GOP presidential candidate Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker before defecting to the Rubio campaign after Walker dropped out of the race.The paid Jeb Bush staffer provided Breitbart News with Hurst's cell phone number, and Breitbart News proceeded to interview Hurst about the incident. Only after interviewing Hurst and reviewing the video of the incident, Breitbart News went on to contact and interview Black. Black agreed to do the interview, and the story went viral getting nearly a thousand comments on Breitbart News.Politico also clearly thought the story was newsworthy, though, as it posted video of Black as Robot Rubio on its website and on its Vine account. Politico's was less detailed, however, than Breitbart News's--and didn't include an interview with Black or with Hurst about the incident, as Breitbart News did. Gold's piece makes no mention of the fact that Politico also covered the news--and it's unclear if she believes Politico's piece was ""coordination"" with Black as well.Breitbart News's quote in the article--from editor-in-chief Alex Marlow--makes it clear that no such ""coordination"" was happening.Marlow told Gold:Aaron Black reached out to Breitbart and then we covered this and multiple other stories on our website and on our radio show on Sirius XM Patriot Channel 125. Breitbart News Network is proud to work with sources from across the political spectrum to cover important and breaking news stories so that we may bring the most informative reporting to our readers. This type of reporting proves why Breitbart continues to have amazing growth with over 200 million monthly page views and 36 million monthly unique visitors. In addition, this month we launched an online store and radio show with Major League Superstar Curt Schilling.But Gold wasn't interested in accuracy. She had a preconceived narrative that she was interested in pushing before she even reached out about the matter. And it appears that narrative she preconceived came from an anonymous source. As they do best, Politico quotes an anonymous source to make an unsubstantiated allegation against Breitbart News's coverage of Robot Rubio--which took off as a meme online after that New Hampshire incident, spilling over into South Carolina where Rubio lost embarrassingly to Trump again.""[Black] worked directly with Breitbart's political team on the ground in the primary states to sabotage Marco Rubio & Ted Cruz, and elect Trump as nominee of [the Republican] party,"" the anonymous source who was not otherwise identified told Gold. ""[Black] was coordinating with [Breitbart's] top staff to rabble rouse against Rubio at rallies.""Again, this anonymous quote is laced with half-truths. After the first story did so well in New Hampshire, Black informed Breitbart News that he was planning to continue the effort down in South Carolina--where the primaries went next for the First in the South contest. There were several events that Black trolled Rubio at as a ""Robot Rubio"" there, but Breitbart News--upon an exhaustive review on Monday--does not seem to have actually covered any of them on this website, despite his efforts to get us to do so. They didn't rise to the level of newsworthiness. Instead, Breitbart News was focused on other newsworthy developments during the South Carolina primary, including how Rubio was missing campaign events, how U.S. immigration officers were offering a historic rejection of his candidacy, how a prominent South Carolina blogger said that Rubio's campaign manager pushed the story of an affair between him and Gov. Nikki Haley years ago, and how his campaign basically dissembled there.That fully debunks the Politico story. But the insanity doesn't stop there. Right after Politico went up with its story--while she was live on the air Monday night--Megyn Kelly interrupted a live panel discussion to rush the unverified and now debunked story on air.""As we are on the air right now, Politico's Hadas Gold breaks this story saying that the same group--Democracy Partners... that group according to Politico coordinated also with, get this, I'm gonna blow your mind now,"" Kelly said, before revealing:Breitbart. Breitbart, which is a conservative, they think it's alt-right--whatever--to hurt Marco Rubio. Let me--I'm just reading this now--coordinated during the primaries to cover disruptions of events for candidates such as Marco Rubio. So you've got the groups on the left who dislike Rubio and the groups on the far-right who dislike Rubio. They didn't make Rubio go into robot-mode when Chris Christie came after him, but the point is these are dirty, dirty tricks and these Democracy Partners should not have been coordinating with Hillary Clinton--she was not allowed to do that.This isn't the first time Kelly has rushed inaccurate and unsubstantiated stories onto her air. In fact, as part of her long-documented quest to dismantle Trump's presidential campaign, early in the primaries just after he launched the campaign Kelly rushed a hit piece from the Daily Beast on air that claimed inaccurately that Trump raped his ex-wife Ivana Trump. Ivana Trump and Donald Trump discredited the Daily Beast's inaccurate smear within a day--and the next night Kelly backed off the story.It remains to be seen if both Gold--and Kelly--among the others in media who have reprinted this inaccurate narrative will retract or apologize for their inaccuracies.A liberal activist and organizer coordinated with reporters from the conservative news site Breitbart during the primaries to cover his disruptions of events for candidates such as Sen. Marco Rubio. Aaron Black, an associate with Democracy Partners and a former Occupy Wall Street organizer, worked with the pro-Trump site Breitbart, tipping it off about his stunts, exchanging raw video and coordinating coverage, according to a source with direct knowledge of the situation.In an email Democracy Partners denied that Black worked directly with the Breitbart team.

About 1.4 million Americans are expected to lose their current medical payment plans in 2017 as the companies flee Obamacare.Though Obamacare's mandate of coverage for pre-existing conditions has been popular, the healthcare reform's staggering problems means that customers with chronic medical conditions will likely find switching insurers rather difficult and stressful.""Enrollees may need to change doctors or drugs when they switch insurers,"" said Caroline Pearson of the consulting firm Avalere Health.The Obama administration is trying to put a positive spin on the bad news by arguing that taxpayer-funded subsidies for Obamacare customers will rise along with the premiums.Obamacare essentially expanded Medicaid by increasing the number of people who are eligible for the federally funded program, most of the 10 million Obamacare customers who purchase their health insurance through healthcare.gov are actually on Medicaid and, thus, are eligible for more federal assistance.""Enrollment is concentrated among very low-income individuals who receive significant government subsidies to reduce premiums and cost-sharing,"" Pearson said.However, about five to seven million Americans are either ineligible for subsidies or else purchase their health insurance policies outside of the exchanges, without subsidies.President Barack Obama has tried to minimize the problems with his healthcare law, referring to them as ""growing pains.""As his presidency winds down, he has pushed for a government-sponsored ""public option"" - or Medicare for everyone - as a means to ""fix"" Obamacare. Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is now pushing that expansion of government-run healthcare.However, Marilyn Tavenner, the former director of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and official responsible for running healthcare.gov, says attempting to ""fix"" Obamacare by adding a public option would be ""a huge mistake"" that would only add ""more bureaucracy and administrative cost"" to healthcare.""I think that the public option debate or even the consideration of yet another government-oriented program would be a huge mistake,"" said Tavenner, who resigned her post in 2015 and is now CEO of America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), the national trade association representing health insurance companies.""If the program hasn't stabilized in three years, it's going to need some additional relief,"" she said, hinting at a business push for more taxpayer-funded spending. ""So I just think we need to solve the problem that we have versus chasing yet another program - adding more bureaucracy and administrative cost to the system.""Obama has boasted that, as a result of his healthcare law, the nation's uninsured rate has dropped below nine percent, many of those who now have an insurance card are finding themselves without actual coverage and real-life healthcare.

And he had a rough night when he went home that night,"" Trump said, possibly referring to his opponent's reaction to her husband's remarks.As he usually does at his campaign rallies, Trump called out the media for not giving him his due for the enormity of the crowds and for giving Clinton special favors, particularly regarding the debates.""Hillary Clinton even got the debate questions in advance from Donna Brazile,"" he said. ""She got the debate questions in advance. Think of it. Did you hear this? Hillary Clinton got the debate questions in advance from Donna Brazile. And she knew it was wrong. But never said anything to anyone. But used the questions anyway. She is crooked Hillary, she knew it was wrong, Donna Brazile is under pressure.""""She should be more guilty than Donna Brazile,"" he continued. ""She took the questions, knew it was wrong. Went to the debate. Had the answers. I mean, how corrupt are we going to get? But the media isn't just against me, they are against all of you. That's what it is. Like Hillary Clinton they look down on hard working people within our country. The media is entitled, condescending, and even contemptuous of people who don't share elitist views.""Trump also took on critics who accuse him of having ties with the Russian government.Ever since WikiLeaks has played a role in the campaign by publishing leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee and from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, Clinton supporters have accused the Trump campaign of working with the Russian government, whom they allege to be behind the leaked emails.However, Trump turned those claims around on Clinton before attendees by pointing out Podesta's links to Russia and questioning why that's not pointed out while his supposed ties are.""Podesta's also linked to a major Kremlin-backed firm in Russia,"" he said. ""You know the way every time Russia's brought up they say, 'Oh Trump.' What do I have to do with it? And now they're linked.""Trump went on to call attention to a Russian uranium deal then-Secretary of State Clinton's State Department approved after the Clinton Foundation received a $145 million donation from the shareholders of Uranium One.""Remember that Hillary Clinton gave Russia 20 percent of American uranium,"" he said. ""And you know she was paid a fortune. They got a tremendous amount of money.""Other pledges Trump made to the audience included cancelling President Barack Obama's executive orders, doubling down on his pledge that Mexico would pay for a border wall between it and the United States, and uniting the country.""Just imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God, saluting one American flag,"" he declared.Trump's impressive showing at the MidFlorida Amphitheatre is not a small feat. As Hillsborough County, FL -- the home of Tampa -- has gone in the previous four presidential elections, so has the presidency, with it going for George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004 and for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012.Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poorSIGN UP"

The most notorious example of this maneuver was the president's healthcare reform legislation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, HR 3590, which passed the House as a bill to help veterans buy their own homes: Service Members Home Ownership Tax Act of 2009.Capitol Hill conservatives railed against ending the continuing resolution in the middle of the lame duck session of Congress, when retiring and defeated congressmen and senators are often motivated to set themselves for private life, rather than the best solutions for the American people.Conservatives wanted a Long-CR, which would have ended in March and would have allowed the new president and Congress to settle in before addressing the final 2016 programs and funding levels. Their concerns were ignored by the Republican leadership, which pushed through its Short-CR.Brandon said before the House Republicans vote for their leadership team, conservatives want to see how they handle the Short-CR and other legislative items in the lame duck.""Will the conference fight for conservative priorities in the lame duck and into the next Congress? Or will it continue down the path of the status quo that has frustrated conservative grassroots activists across America,"" he asked.Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R.-Wis.) was the man who made certain the Short-CR passed, so conservatives want to watch him closely in the legislative action between the election and the swearing in of the new Congress, Brandon said.""Sadly, Speaker Ryan supported a lame duck session of Congress, which means there is still work to be done by the House in November and December,"" he said.""The extent to which Speaker Ryan fights for fiscal sanity and conservative priorities in the upcoming funding battle are key to understanding whether the House Republican Conference will produce a bold conservative policy agenda and fight to move it through next Congress or whether the status quo, in which government continues to grow and more debt and deficits are piled on taxpayers, will be maintained.""SIGN UP"

Granholm left Priorities USA in August 2015 to work for a different pro-Hillary PAC, David Brock's Correct the Record, and became a Clinton campaign surrogate.In another email released by Wikileaks, Podesta said that he planned to ""Get Priorities functional.""

The number of active TB cases in Minnesota increased from 147 in 2014 to 150 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control.Less than 1.5 percent of Minnesota's residents, or 81,971 of the state's 5.5 million population, were born in Sub-Saharan Africa, according to the Census Bureau.""The most distinguishing characteristic of the epidemiology of TB disease in Minnesota continues to be the large proportion of cases occurring among persons born outside the United States,"" the MDH reported, adding that 60 percent of the 129 foreign-born cases of TB diagnosed in Minnesota in 2015 (77) were born in Sub-Saharan Africa:In 2015, the percentage of TB cases in Minnesota occurring in foreign-born persons was 86%, compared to 66% of TB cases reported nationally. The 129 foreign-born TB cases reported in Minnesota represented 26 different countries of birth; the most common region of birth among these patients was Sub-Saharan Africa (60% of foreign-born cases), followed by South/ Southeast Asia (22%), East Asia/Pacific (10%), and Latin America (including the Caribbean) (6%) (Figure 7). All 6 U.S.- born pediatric TB cases (<15 years of age at diagnosis) had at least one foreign-born parent or guardian. These second-generation children appear to experience an increased risk of TB disease that more closely resembles that of foreign-born persons.Among the foreign-born TB cases, 19% were diagnosed with TB within the first 12 months after arriving in the United States, and an additional 12% were diagnosed 1 - 2 years after arrival. These cases most likely acquired TB infection prior to immigrating and started progressing to active TB disease shortly after arrival. Of the 16 cases >=15 years of age who arrived as immigrants or refugees and diagnosed in Minnesota within 12 months of arriving in the U.S., only 4 had any TB-related condition noted in their pre-immigration medical examination reports. These findings highlight the need for clinicians to have a high index of suspicion for TB among newly arrived foreign-born persons, regardless of the results of medical exams performed overseas.Previously, Breitbart News reported that 296 refugees resettled in the state in the five years between 2010 and 2014 were diagnosed with active TB, according to the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH). During those five years, 161 residents of Minnesota born in Somalia, which is in Sub-Saharan Africa, were diagnosed with active TB. Almost all migrants to the United States from Somalia have arrived through the federal refugee resettlement program.Minnesota has the largest Somalian community in the United States, estimated to be between 40,000 and 70,000.As the MDH reported:In 2015, 150 tuberculosis (TB) cases (2.7 per 100,000 population) were reported. This represents a 2% increase in the number of cases compared to 2014 (147), but a 37% decrease in the number of cases since 2007, when the highest number (238) in the past decade was reported. As seen in most years, Minnesota's TB incidence rate in 2015 was lower than the national rate of 3.0 cases per 100,000 population. Two (1%) of the cases died due to TB related causes. . .The vast majority (87%) of TB cases reported in Minnesota in 2015 were identified as a result of individuals seeking medical care for symptoms of disease. Various targeted public health interventions identified a portion of the remaining 13% of cases. Such methods of case identification are considered high priority, core TB prevention and control activities; they included TB contact investigations (3%), follow-up evaluations resulting from abnormal findings on pre-immigration exams performed overseas (3%), and domestic refugee health assessments (2%). An additional 3% were identified through other means (e.g., other immigration medical exams, occupational screening or other targeted testing for TB). Five (3%) cases were diagnosed with active TB disease incidentally while being evaluated for another medical condition.At least eight cases of active TB were diagnosed among refugees upon their arrival in Minnesota in 2015, bringing the total number of cases of active TB among refugees in Minnesota over the past six years to at least 304. That also increases the number of active TB cases diagnosed among refugees over the past six years in the fifteen states in which Breitbart News has been able to obtain data to 476, broken down as follows:Minnesota (304), Wisconsin (27), Nebraska (21), Louisiana (21), Michigan (19),  Vermont (17), Colorado (16), Florida (11), Ohio (11 in one county), Idaho (7), Kentucky (9 in one county), North Dakota (4 in one county),  Indiana (4), California (3), and Tennessee, where two refugees have been diagnosed with the very dangerous, multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB.Three cases of active TB (two percent) were diagnosed among refugees in Minnesota in 2015 at their initial ""domestic refugee health assessment,"" and five cases (three percent) were diagnosed among refugees as part of ""follow-up evaluations resulting from abnormal findings on pre-immigration exams performed overseas."" Those refugees arrive in the United States with A1, B1, B2, or B3 tuberculosis health risk classifications.It is not clear how many of the 129 foreign-born cases of active TB diagnosed in Minnesota in 2015 came into the United States as refugees and were diagnosed subsequent to their initial domestic medical screening but within ten years of their arrival.Based on past experience in Minnesota, that number is likely to account for a majority of the 129 cases of foreign-born TB diagnosed in Minnesota in 2015.""The majority of those [296] refugees [diagnosed with active TB between 2010 and 2014] actually developed TB disease after being in Minnesota at least five years, and many had been in the US at least 10 years, so these are not new arrivals to the US,"" a spokesperson for the MDH told Breitbart News last week.Breitbart News contacted the MDH to confirm how many of the 77 Sub-Saharan migrants to the state diagnosed with active TB in 2015 were refugees.""The information that is available is on our website. We do not have additional analysis or cross-tabulated information to share at this time,"" a spokesperson for the MDH tells Breitbart News.In 2015, the percentage of TB cases in Minnesota occurring in foreign-born persons was 86%, compared to 66% of TB cases reported nationally.

""But what America cannot have for any prolonged period of time is ... a fundamentally unserious person and somebody whose standards of ethics and tolerance and how they treat other people is corrosive.""Obama embarked on a lengthy diatribe in front of Democratic donors in California, after spending the morning golfing with his press secretary Josh Earnest.He warned that Trump would be a threat to the Constitution of the United States.""Do we think of the Constitution as something fundamental that all of us have an obligation to try to uphold, or do we think that it's just something that we can pick and choose from at our convenience depending on what's expedient?"" he asked.He warned that Trump would make the country into ""an infomercial or a reality show"" because he had ""no fidelity to the truth.""""We can't have that in the Oval Office,"" Obama stated.The president called for Democrats to beat Trump soundly in the presidential election to send a message that would echo throughout the world.""We've got to work as hard as we can, not just to make sure that Hillary wins, but to make sure she wins big to send a clear message about who we are as a people; to send a clear message about what America stands for,"" he said.He ridiculed Trump for suggesting that the system was ""rigged"" against him, comparing him to a kid having a tantrum on the playground.""You know there was always the kid who, like, if they weren't winning, they'd be all like starting to have a tantrum and start whining and complaining about this isn't fair,"" he said as the audience laughed. ""Well, no, you just got beat, that's all.""The president argued that Republicans did not offer a ""check"" on a potential Hillary Clinton presidency, but rather the same gridlock that he faced as president.""A check means that we're not going to get serious about dealing with all the major issues that the American people desperately want to see dealt with,"" Obama said.He warned that Democratic priorities like stopping global warming, increasing the minimum wage, and spending on free early child care would be blocked without significant majorities in the House and Senate.Republicans, he explained, were acting like ""Keystone Cops"" who couldn't even keep the government open, blaming the Republican Freedom Caucus.""A check means the possibility of another government shutdown unless we get some crazy riders that are attached to the budget that have nothing to do with the but have to do with the particular social agenda of the Freedom Caucus, so-called.""Obama also blamed Republicans for creating the pervasive cynicism about government and the politics of Washington D.C.""If you're frustrated about more jobs and a faster-growing economy, you got to understand how this happened,"" he said. ""It happened because the Republican Party wanted to put a check on progress. We got to vote against that. We got to push back against that.""SIGN UP"

He did not want anybody to tell anybody about what had happened.""Jones was speaking to this reporter in an interview filmed in the presidential suite of the Watergate Hotel in Washington, D.C.Jones recounted the details of the alleged incident, which she says transpired when Clinton was Governor of Arkansas.She has said that she was singled out by Clinton and was escorted by the state trooper to the politician's room in the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock, Arkansas, where the future president allegedly groped and exposed himself to her.In the video interview, Jones said that when she entered the hotel room, she saw Clinton loosening his tie and she tried to make small talk about Hillary Clinton.She recounted:""And he started talking about that he likes my curves.

And then he was just you know trying to talk about you know the way I looked. And then I started talking about something else. Trying to distract him and trying to get away from him.So I got away from him towards the windowsill... And I was looking down at the Arkansas River. And I was talking about how beautiful it was up there. And then he tried a second time. He leaned on the windowsill and he tried to pull me towards him. Wanting to kiss on me.And I said, 'No.'And then I turned around and I was going to get out toward the door. There was no bed in there. It was kind of set up like an office. You know with couches and tables and stuff like that.... And I was thinking on my gosh what is going on? My head was just spinning. And I was thinking is this really happening? This can't really be happening. It was surreal to me..... I'm getting closer to the door. I'm thinking how am I going to get out of here? Am I just going to run out? I know the state police is sitting outside. So how am I going to get out so fast.I was really scared. And then I thought okay. Am I being taped? I thought something was going on. I was just freaking out, you know. All this time thinking how am I going to get out of this situation? So I got over close towards... There was a wall. It was getting closer to the door. And there was a couch. And so I started talking to him again about something I think his wife had been doing or something. Just to try to give him an idea that you are not supposed to be doing this here, you know.And he sat down really fast and he dropped his pants. And he was fondling himself. And he asked me to kiss it. Now that is disgusting. And I said I am not that kind of girl. And I said I need to be getting back to the front desk. And he said, 'Well, if you have any trouble to have your boss call me immediately.'He started pulling up (his pants) ..and his face turned real red. And I've seen that look so many times since then on TV or stuff when he would be blamed or caught for doing something. And you can tell he's such a liar....And then when I got to the door he had already pulled up his pants and everything... And was tucking his shirt in. I don't know. And I was trying to get out. And he held the door momentarily and he said, 'You are a smart girl. Let's keep this between ourselves.' He did not want anybody to tell anybody about what had happened.I asked whether she felt trapped inside the hotel room.""Yeah,"" Jones replied. ""Because I know the state police was sitting outside. ...He was in plain clothes but he showed me that he packed a gun inside.

(AP) -- Former Attorney General Kathleen Kane was sentenced Monday to 10 to 23 months in jail for illegally disclosing details from a grand jury investigation to embarrass a rival and lying about it under oath.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERKane was also sentenced to eight years of probation by a Montgomery County judge who said Kane's ego drove her to take down enemies and break the law.Judge Wendy Demchick-Alloy said Kane assumed an ""off with your heads"" mentality as she ran the state's top law enforcement agency. The judge called Kane a political ""neophyte"" who failed to make the transition from campaigner to public servant after she took office.""This case is about ego - the ego of a politician consumed with her image from Day One,"" Demchick-Alloy said. ""This case is about retaliation and revenge against perceived enemies who this defendant ... felt had embarrassed her in the press.""Kane, the first woman and first Democrat elected as the state's top prosecutor, was handcuffed in court and led out a side door. She will remain in custody until she posts $75,000 cash bail, higher than she had previously posted.After she posts bond, she will remain free while she appeals her conviction.She had been a stay-at-home mother, and former assistant county prosecutor, before using her husband's trucking fortune to run for statewide office in 2012. She quickly became a rising star in the state Democratic Party before her office devolved into turmoil as career prosecutors came and went.Kane and her husband are now estranged and share custody of their teenage boys.""Your children are the ultimate ... collateral damages. They are casualties of your actions,"" the judge said. ""But you did that, not this court. ""Earlier Monday, Kane's 15-year-old son, Chris, pleaded for leniency while her former deputies described an office demoralized by her leadership and terrorized by ""Nixonian espionage.""Kane, 50, had argued that the loss of her career, law license and reputation was punishment enough. She had asked the judge to sentence her to probation or house arrest so she could be home to raise her sons.""I really don't care what happens to me,"" Kane said during before leaning toward the defense table to grab tissues. ""There is no more torture in the world than to watch your children suffer and know you had something to do with it.""The one-term attorney general said her younger son, 14-year-old Zachary, did not attend Monday's sentencing because ""he couldn't even bear it.""Kane's family declined to comment after the sentencing.Prosecutors called her crimes ""egregious"" and pushed for jail time. They said a paranoid Kane ruined morale in the 800-person office and the wider law enforcement community through a calculated scheme to embarrass rival prosecutors who had left the office.Kane didn't testify at her trial. She was convicted in August of two felony counts of perjury and seven misdemeanor charges, and she resigned the next day.On Monday, former deputy Clarke Madden said in court that a dark cloud permeated every corner of the attorney general's office and victims, witnesses and other law enforcement agencies feared working with them.""Through a pattern of systemic firings and Nixonian espionage, she created a terror zone in this office,"" said Erik Olsen, a career prosecutor who is now the chief deputy attorney general.Kane enjoyed mostly good press early on as she supported gay marriage, ramped up a child predator unit run by her twin sister and questioned her predecessor's handling of the Penn State sex assault case.But turmoil inside the office became apparent as top deputies and career prosecutors headed for the doors. Kane's feud with one of them, Frank Fina, who had helped run the Penn State probe and other sensitive investigations, led to the leak.Kane, taking aim at him, had a campaign consultant pass confidential files to a reporter about a corruption case Fina had declined to charge before he left the office. She then tried to frame someone else for the leak, aides testified at the perjury and obstruction trial.Aside from the conviction, Kane's political career will be remembered for her investigation of pornography that she said was being traded on state computers by judges, lawyers and other public employees. Two state Supreme Court justices resigned amid the fallout.SIGN UP"

After the two haggled, Mithavayani fraudulently charged $38.50 worth of ""food"" to the card and gave the officer $20 in cash, Mithavayani admitted in courtThe undercover officer completed 15 fraudulent cash transactions over a 2 1/2 year period, court records say. Mithavayani approved some of the transactions, but most were approved by his employees.Prosecutors declined to say what the sentence will be, but included in the court records that Mithavayani owes more than $694,500 in restitution.The defense is contesting that amount and recommends a penalty of house arrest or 10 to 16 months in federal prison because Mithavayani has no criminal record.U.S. District Judge Cecilia M. Altonaga will make her final decision on his punishment at a hearing scheduled for Monday.SIGN UP"

Robert Pittenger in response to the Pentagon's internal report. He added that the Pentagon should ""act swiftly on perceived cyber-threats and remove IT vendors from our supply chain if evidence exists suggesting a security vulnerability.""""I would be very disappointed to learn, however, if the Defense Department or the Air Force sought to obfuscate the facts regarding contracts with Lenovo when this issue was brought to my attention back in April,"" he continued.""The Chinese government has a major stake in Lenovo,"" said former military intelligence official Larry Wortzel. ""China remains one of the main threats to U.S. government and corporate information systems... One way to keep those systems safe is to ensure you are not getting system updates that may have a back door that can be opened by a Chinese intelligence service.""""Although we are concerned any time another nation or individual attempts to initiate intelligence collection against the Department of Defense, we do not discuss internal assessments,"" said Joint Staff spokesman Capt.
