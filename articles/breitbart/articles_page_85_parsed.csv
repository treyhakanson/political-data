Williams noted there was a mere negative mention of Thomas, referencing the controversy around his confirmation hearing when Hill accused Thomas of sexual harassment.""In 1991 Anita Hill charged Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas with sexual harassment,"" a mention of Thomas in a museum exhibit reads.Mark Paoletta, a close friend of Thomas, says the museum is doing a disservice to African Americans by ignoring Thomas' contributions.In an op-ed, Paoletta, who worked as assistant White House Counsel to President George H.W. Bush, said the museum ""implies that there's no room for a black man who dares to challenge conventional wisdom of the Left. It also ensures that visitors will learn nothing about one of our nation's most significant jurists.""""Surely a museum that 'seeks to understand American history through the lens of the African American experience' should be more diverse than that,"" Paoletta, who practices law in Washington D.C., added.The museum didn't return Breitbart News's request for comment.Paoletta told Breitbart News on Wednesday that Thomas's ""jurisprudence is a force to be reckoned with.""""To not have Justice Thomas is outrageous,"" he stated during a phone interview with Breitbart News about the museum. ""A man who epitomizes an American success story of being born into poverty in the deep, segregated south and to overcome all those obstacles throughout his life and then to be appointed to the Supreme Court and to have a truly remarkable record...to essentially ignore the Justice in the museum is outrageous, but it's not surprising.""""They won't even celebrate the achievements of this incredible man because he thinks differently,"" Paoletta stated, referencing Thomas's conservative record. ""How offensive is that?""""The African American museum wants to disappear him, as I call it, like he doesn't exist and to me that's just offensive that they would do that,"" he alleged.The 25th anniversary of Thomas's confirmation to the Supreme Court is Oct. 15 and Paoletta wants people to know his friend is a ""wonderful guy,"" creating JusticeThomas.com to honor the history of his friend.Paoletta recalled how Justice Thomas would spend a full day at a retirement home for nuns in order to visit his 8th grade Catholic school teacher.""When she was retired...in a retirement home with probably 50 or 60 other retired nuns, Justice Thomas and I would ... go up every year, just the two of us,"" Paoletta recalled about his friend. ""He's a guy that never forgets who helps him.""He also shared that Justice Thomas loves the Nebraska Cornhuskers. ""He knows the name of every player and in fact the name of every recruit, knows their 40 yard dash time, and how many recruiting stars each player has. It's amazing!"" Paoletta praised, adding that Justice Thomas even served as an honorary coach at one game. ""That's why he is so well liked when people meet him. He is just a regular guy, who happens to be a Supreme Court Justice.""SIGN UP"	['Hill', 'Williams']	[]

Mike Pence and Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine offered voters two distinctly different choices on the issue of Syrian refugees, at the Oct. 4 vice-presidential debate.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERPence, Republican nominee Donald Trump's running mate, told voters the GOP ticket wants to suspend acceptance of the Syrian refugees.Kaine, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's running mate, said he and the former Secretary of State want to accelerate  the Syrian refugee program, a position he has held since May 2015. Back then, he was one of fourteen U.S. Senators, dubbed by critics the ""Jihad Caucus,"" who called for an increase in the number of Syrian refugees resettled in the United States to 65,000 annually. It's a position Clinton herself has supported since September 2015.In Fiscal Year 2016, the Obama administration resettled over 12,500 Syrian refugees in the United States, a dramatic contrast to the 2,300 who resettled in all four previous fiscal years.""Donald Trump and I are committed to suspending the Syrian refugee program and programs and immigration from areas of the world that have been compromised by terrorism."" Pence said.""Donald Trump has called for extreme vetting, so we don't bring people in to the United States who are hostile to our Bill of Rights freedoms, who are hostile to the American way of life,"" he stated. ""Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to increase the Syrian refugee program by 500 [per cent],"" Pence added.Kaine, Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton's running mate, offered a different choice on Syrian refugees. ""We have different views on refugee issues and on immigration,"" Kaine said.""Hillary and I will do immigration enforcement and we'll vet refugees based on whether they're dangerous or not. These guys say all Mexicans are bad,"" Kaine said.""And with respect to refugees, we want to keep people out if they're dangerous. Donald Trump said keep them out if they're Muslim. Mike Pence put together a program that said keep them out if they're from Syria,"" Kaine added.According to the new Breitbart/Gravis poll released on Wednesday, voters overwhelmingly agree with Trump and Pence on the Syrian refugees issue.In the  national poll of 1,690 registered  voters conducted on October 3, sixty-two percent oppose increasing Syrian refugees, while 54 percent said they do not believe the claim by President Barack Obama that Syrian refugees have been subjected to the most rigorous security vetting.The Obama administration wants to increase the number of refugees coming into the United States by 29 percent next year to 110,000, up from 85,000 this year.

""And yesterday an Appellate Court with three Republican judges struck down the Pence plan and said it was discriminatory,"" Kaine said.""Those judges said this was because there wasn't any evidence . . . yet . . . that ISIS had infiltrated the United States,"" Pence hit back. ""Well, Germany just arrested three Syrian refugees who were connected to ISIS....,"" Pence continued, before Kaine interrupted him, one of the seventy times he did so during the evening.""But they told you there's a right way and a wrong way to do it,"" Kaine said.""Well look, if you're going to be critical of me on that, that's fair game,"" Pence responded. ""But look, I will tell you after two Syrian refugees were involved in the attack in Paris that is called Paris's 9-11, as governor of the state of Indiana, I have no higher priority than the safety and security of the people of my state,"" Pence responded.""As Vice President of the United States, we're going to put the safety and security of the people of the United States first,"" he added.Kaine disagreed with Pence. ""But let's be clear. Hillary and I will do immigration enforcement, and we'll vet refugees based on whether they're dangerous or not, we won't do it based on discriminating against you for the country you come from or the religion you have,"" he said.""That is completely antithetical to the Jeffersonian values of equality,"" he insisted.""The director of the FBI said, the [head] of Homeland Security said we can't know who these people are, coming from [Syria]...,"" Pence began, before Kaine interrupted him again.""Yes, we can. If we don't know who they are, we don't let them in,"" Kaine said.Pence returned to his theme.""The director of the FBI and Homeland Security said we can't know for certain ... You've got to err on the side of the safety and security of the American people,"" he told Kaine.""By trashing all Syrians, by trashing all Muslims?"" Kaine asked.The message disciplined Pence drove home his point in response. ""We're going to put the safety and security of the American people first,"" he concluded.

Fixing America's trade deals, securing the nation, ending government corruption, fixing inner cities, and helping Latino Americans were also part of the ""Make America Wealthy Again"" plan's outline.""America needs a comeback. America needs a change. And that's why I'm running,"" said Trump.""President Obama said if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor. That was a lie. He promised his plan would reduce premiums by $2,500 dollars. Instead, they surged $5,000. Another lie,"" said Trump.Trump then hammered away at former President Bill Clinton's statements this week on the failures of Obamacare:Two days ago, Bill Clinton torched President Obama's signature legislation. Remember, Hillary Clinton called Obamacare ""one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country.""Bill has a different view. Here is what Bill said: He just said it's a ""crazy system,"" and that ""it's the craziest thing in the world.""Bill said, ""people out there [are] busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, [and] wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half...the people getting killed in this deal are the small business people and the individuals who make just a bit too much money to get any of these subsidies."" Clinton added that it ""doesn't make any sense,"" and that ""the insurance model doesn't work.""On my first day in office, I am going to ask a Republican Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare. There is only one way to stop Obamacare: to vote for Trump.""I think that President Obama should apologize for Obamacare,"" said Trump.He continued to the next point on his plan, ""Fixing our trade deals will be the foundation of our economic revival.""""Every time we start making progress, china starts devaluing their currency,"" said Trump. ""Our politicians don't get it.""""Our jobs are being lost in massive numbers, and we are not making things in America anymore,"" he said.Trump detailed the economic trials that have faced the United States in recent decades:When I am President, we will start making things in America again. Our nation has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton's NAFTA - a deal supported by Hillary Clinton. Hillary's Korea deal also cost us another 100,000 jobs. Since China entered the World Trade Organization - another Bill and Hillary-backed deal - 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States. That's 15 factories closing a day, on average.""He remarked on the results of factories leaving, ""Stores close, schools suffer, the tax base erodes, wages fall and the quality of life declines.""""We've rebuilt other countries at the expense of our own,"" said Trump who said he will renegotiated NAFTA. ""If we don't get the deal we want, we will withdraw from NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal for our workers."" Trump said he will also stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership that former Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton called the ""Gold Standard.""American businesses will see lower taxes from 35 to 15 percent, according to Trump. Many small businesses will file as individuals and pay only 12 percent, he said of his plan, adding that he will fix the regulatory system. ""Our regulations are a disaster,"" they're putting people out of business, he added.Trump described that under his administration, ""Our tax, trade, energy and regulatory reforms will help us reach 4% growth and create at least 25 million new jobs in a decade.""""America will become the great jobs magnate of the world,"" he said.""To be a rich nation, we must also be a secure nation. Security begins at the border, you understand,"" Trump said as he moved to the next point on his ""Make America Wealthy Again"" plan outline. ""Any government that does not protect its own people is a government unworthy and unfit to lead,"" he said.As he has many times before, Trump listed by name and description a few of the many Americans who have been killed at the hands of illegal aliens: 21-yera-old Sarah Root, 21-year-old Grant Ronnebeck, young Kate Steinle, 90-year-old Earl Olander, 64-year-old Air Force veteran Marilyn Pharis, and 17-year-old Jamiel Shaw. He invited several ""Angel"" moms onto the stage to speak of their loved ones who have been killed.The women attested strongly to Trump's willingness to listen and act. Agnes Gibboney, whose family immigrated legally, lost her only son Ronald da Silva at the hands of an illegal alien. ""Mr. Trump listens to us. We've had many meetings privately"" and he listens, she said. Laura Wilkerson spoke of her son who was brutally murdered, tortured, and set on fire. ""He cares about American families,"" she said of Trump. ""Mr. Trump seems the only one that gets the simplicity of this.""Trump followed up saying, ""All Americans living lawfully in this country, including millions of patriotic hardworking immigrants, are entitled to have their jobs, their wages, and their security protected. The borders around our nation are for the benefit of all people living here today - and when those borders are erased, it's often the lawful immigrants already here who are the first to suffer lost jobs and decreased security.""Trump said of illegal entrants to the U.S., ""When I am president we are getting them out of our country."" He also spoke of many countries that refuse to take back their citizens from America and asserted that under a Hillary Clinton administration, she will accept that. But, he said, under his administration those countries will take back their citizens.""At the same time, our country is being infiltrated by terrorists. Just two days ago, an immigrant from Bangladesh was charged in another ISIS plot. Hundreds of immigrants from high-risk regions have been implicated in terrorism inside the United States since 9/11,"" said Trump who spoke of several very recent terror attacks in New York and New Jersey, a mall stabbing in Minnesota and a mall shooting in Washington State. He also listed other recent terror attacks. ""The Boston Bombers were here on asylum. The San Bernardino Shooter was here on a fiance visa from Saudi Arabia. The Orlando shooter was the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan,"" Trump said.""We are also going to end the government corruption,"" Trump continued to the next point on his economic plan. He referenced Clinton's careless handling of classified information, the destruction of emails from the private server used to transmit that information, immunity deals for her staffers in the FBI's investigation of the case, and side deals for the destruction of hardware. ""Hillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise and the only way to deliver justice is to mail in your ballots.""Coming to his final point, Trump said, ""We are also going to fix our inner cities, and help Latino Americans.""""Forty-five percent of African-American children under the age of six live in poverty. Fifty-eight percent of African-American youth don't have jobs. More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year. Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore,"" said Trump, who then pointed out ""Democrats, like Hillary Clinton, have run the inner cities for 50 years, sixty years, seventy years or more. They've produced only more joblessness, failing schools, and rising crime.""""To those African-Americans suffering in our country I say: What do you have to lose? Vote for Donald Trump. I will fix it,"" said Trump. ""I am also going to fight to help millions of Latinos trapped in poverty, and to help their children grow up in safety and peace.""Trump said:Here are some more amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017: We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; end common core; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare affordable; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.""A vote for Donald Trump is a vote for change and a vote for me is really a vote for you,"" said Trump. ""All together, we are going to Make America Wealthy Again. We Are Going To Make America Strong Again. We Are Going To Make America Safe Again.""Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana Two days ago, Bill Clinton torched President Obama's signature legislation. Remember, Hillary Clinton called Obamacare ""one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country.""

The booklet begins with the story of Jazz Jennings, a boy who decided in 2007 that he is female. Now aged 16, Jazz is a transgender activist who also sells skin-care products for Johnson & Johnson.The guide urges parents to let their children pick their own gender and to undergo irreversible sexual surgery:Ideally, though, the child takes the lead in these decisions ... Clinicians increasingly embrace a ""gender-affirming"" approach to children who are gender-expansive or transgender. This approach means focusing on what the child says about their own gender identity and expression, and allowing them to determine which forms of gender expression feel comfortable and authenticThe guide gives the impression that there are ""many"" unrecognized transgender children:Misunderstandings about transgender children mean that many still don't get the support they deserve, and the consequences can be tragic. Fortunately, we know far more than ever before about what these children need to grow up safe and healthy. Across the United States and worldwide, policies and attitudes are changing to better support transgender kids.To boost the number of gender-conflicted children, the advocacy book also create a new category of child -- the ""gender-expansive"" child. That term is defined as, ""Children who do not conform to their culture's expectations for boys or girls. Being transgender is one way of being gender-expansive, but not all gender-expansive children are transgender.""Though a study of the 2010 census shows the population of transgender people amounts to one of every 2,400 Americans, or 0.03 percent of the adult population, HRC states the numbers of transgendered children are growing ""as more families decide to affirm their child's gender identity."" That phrase suggests there are many additional unidentified transgender children because parents are just not affirming their ""gender"" choice.HRC states its own commissioned poll found that ""35 percent of U.S. likely voters know someone who is transgender,"" while 12 percent of that group knew a transgender child or teen.""The gay group and the medical groups say their guide is for ""anyone who knows a transgender or gender-expansive child...and offers suggestions for adults with a transgender child in their life.""The American Academy of Pediatrics has been a promoter of leftwing causes, especially Obamacare and the practice of urging pediatricians to ask their child patients about gun ownership during routine office visits. The organization has also issued a policy statement ""urging pediatricians and politicians to work together"" to ""protect children from climate-related threats...""The new push comes as President Barack Obama has begun strongly backing the new gender ideology, which says government should force Americans to accept other people's choice of apparent gender. This year, he threatened schools with funding cuts if they don't end the use of single-sex bathrooms and locker rooms. His administration also backed punishments for children who object to the elimination of distinct single-sex facilities or who refuse to use the female pronoun - 'her' - when referring to boys who wish to live as girls, and urged schools to keep parents in the dark about their children's at-school gender-related activities.Mainstream pediatricians and professionals are becoming very concerned about the mental health of children in America who are now being exposed to the Obama administration's promotion of gender ideology in schools and workplaces.  These professionals signed onto an open letter that asserts the ideology is ""putting the nation's children at risk.""The American College of Pediatricians states gender ideology is harmful to children and that, by promoting gender fluidity in its school bathroom directive, the Obama administration is complicit in masking serious mental health issues in children.The college states:No one is born with a gender. Everyone is born with a biological sex. Gender (an awareness and sense of oneself as male or female) is a sociological and psychological concept; not an objective biological one...A person's belief that he or she is something they are not is, at best, a sign of confused thinking. When an otherwise healthy biological boy believes he is a girl, or an otherwise healthy biological girl believes she is a boy, an objective psychological problem exists that lies in the mind not the body, and it should be treated as such. These children suffer from gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria (GD), formerly listed as Gender Identity Disorder (GID), is a recognized mental disorder in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-V)...""According to the DSM-V, as many as 98% of gender confused boys and 88% of gender confused girls eventually accept their biological sex after naturally passing through puberty,"" the College asserts. ""Conditioning children into believing that a lifetime of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex is normal and healthful is child abuse.""In contrast, HRC and its partner pediatricians' groups say ""gender dysphoria"" must be averted by making sure society comforts the child;Depending on the child's age and signs of distress, ""gender-affirmative"" counseling or therapy can help manage gender dysphoria. However, in many cases, the remedy for dysphoria is gender transition: taking steps to affirm the gender that feels comfortable and authentic to the child. It is important to understand that, for children who have not reached puberty, gender transition involves no medical interventions at all: it consists of social changes like name, pronoun and gender expression.However, once children have reached puberty, which could be any time between age 9 and 16, HRC and its partner pediatricians recommend body-altering drugs and irreversible surgery for children:Children beginning puberty may also use puberty-suppressing medication as they explore their gender identity. Both of these steps are completely reversible.Social transition is equally important for adults and older adolescents. People in these age groups may also take additional steps, including gender-affirming hormone therapy and surgeries.These recommendations clash with the recommendations of Youth Trans Critical Professionals - a group of self-described ""left-leaning, open-minded, and pro-gay rights"" professionals. The group says it is risky to affirm young people who claim to be transgender and provide them with hormonal and surgical treatments to change their bodies.""Our concern is with medical transition for children and youth,"" say Youth Trans Critical Professionals on their website. ""We feel that unnecessary surgeries and/or hormonal treatments which have not been proven safe in the long-term represent significant risks for young people.""""Policies that encourage -- either directly or indirectly -- such medical treatment for young people who may not be able to evaluate the risks and benefits are highly suspect, in our opinion,"" says the organization, which is composed of psychologists, social workers, doctors, and other professionals.The professionals express ""alarm"" that, because of the current trendiness of being transgendered, many young people have decided they are a member of the opposite sex simply as a result of ""binges"" on social media sites. They describe a process of transgender activists recruiting these young people for their ""cult.""""There is evidence that vulnerable young people are being actively recruited and coached on such sites to believe that they are trans,"" the professionals say.As noted, HRC and its partner pediatricians urge only ""gender-affirmative"" therapy. Youth Trans Critical Professionals view state prohibitions against other forms of therapy that may help young people evaluate their feelings as dangerous since they may block the process of critical thinking and evaluation of the young person regarding the reasons why he or she desires to become a transgender member of the opposite sex.They explain:While the sentiment behind this legislation is laudable, in some cases, it is being interpreted to mean that therapists cannot explore gender identity with a youth who is professing to be trans. This would mean we can't ask why; we can't explore underlying mental health issues; we can't consider the symbolic nature of the gender dysphoria; and we can't look at possible confounding issues such as social media use or social contagion.The signers of the open letter write that radical progressives promoting the gender fluid policy for young people are ""distorting the law"" against a flood of opposition from ""the overwhelming majority of Americans.""They add:In addition, considering all the possible actions the federal government should be taking to keep us safe -- like addressing porous borders, rising terrorism, the weakening economy, the escalating collapse of the Middle East, rising crime rates, etc. -- we firmly believe that, in setting bathroom, shower and locker room policies in local schools, the federal government has exceeded its authorities while putting our children's mental health at risk to politically-driven psychology and their very lives in peril at the hands of potential sexual predators.The leaders urge others ""to join us in opposing this grave threat to children and this abject rejection of law-making by self-government, that manner by which America's founders intended our constitutional system to function.""

When those who only ""somewhat"" oppose or approve of the Iran deal are included, 46% of registered voters oppose the deal, while 42% approve of it. Another 12% said they do not know.Regardless of their views of the deal itself, 60% of registered voters expect Iran to cheat on the deal. Only 14% said that Iran will not cheat, while 26% said they were unsure.Iran deal Gravis poll Oct. 5 (Breitbart / Gravis)The deal requires Iran to slow its nuclear enrichment activities for several years, in exchange for relief from international sanctions. Critics say -- and President Barack Obama has admitted -- that even if Iran keeps the deal, it will still be able to produce nuclear weapons after a decade or so. Iran also claims that the deal allows it to continue developing nuclear-capable ballistic missiles, which the Obama administration had promised it would not.Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton claims credit for the initial negotiations that led to the deal. Vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine erroneously claimed in Tuesday night's debate that the Iran deal had ""eliminated"" the regime's nuclear program, when in fact the Iran deal merely slowed it, at best.Voters who expect Iran to cheat on the deal would probably not be surprised to learn that it has already done so -- but might be surprised to know that the Obama administration allowed Iran to be out of compliance with the deal's terms at the outset.Just as Colombian voters rejected a ""peace"" deal earlier this week, American voters would likely vote against the Iran deal if given the chance. But the deal was never ratified by the Senate, and Democrats used the filibuster to prevent the Senate from voting on it when it was presented last year.Clinton and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump were tied in the overall poll, 44% to 44% in a four-way race, despite a majority saying that Clinton won last week's first presidential debate. Libertarian Gary Johnson took 5% and Green Party nominee Jill Stein captured 1% of the vote.The poll surveyed 1,690 registered voters on Oct. 3 and has a margin of error of 2.4%.Joel B.

Do you think this is a good idea or not?"" 71% called the policy a ""bad idea,"" while only 7% called it a ""good idea,"" and 21% were ""unsure.""Asked whether ""this [is] an example of America's weakening leadership in the world,"" 51% of registered voters agreed, 36% disagreed, and 13% were unsure.The poll was conducted Oct. 3 among 1,690 registered voters with a 2.4% margin of error.The ICANN handover had been expected long ago, but was delayed by successive administrations, particularly as control of the root directory of the Internet became seen as a strategic asset. The Obama administration sought to appease international outrage over its eavesdropping on foreign leaders, revealed in Edward Snowden's leaks about the National Security Agency, by transferring control of ICANN. Critics charge that there is no international body currently capable of overseeing ICANN, and that without the antitrust exemptions it had formerly enjoyed under U.S. law, it will eventually come under the control of the United Nations' International Telecommunications Union, where repressive governments have considerable influence.Republican presidential nominee issued a statement strongly opposing the handover of ICANN last month.Clinton led Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in the overall poll, 44% to 43% in a four-way race, a result well within the poll's margin of error, and despite a majority saying that Clinton won the first presidential debate.

""You were totally in favor of it and then you heard how I said how bad it was. And if you win, you would approve it. And it would be almost as bad as NAFTA.""In response to Trump's attacks, Clinton opted to defend her husband's trade policies. ""Manufacturing went up in the 1990s,"" Clinton said- dismissing Trump's criticism of NAFTA by stating, ""Well, that's your opinion.""In an October 3rd survey of 1,690 random registered voters across the country, voters were asked whether they agreed or disagreed with Trump's assertion that NAFTA ""is the worst trade deal in modern American history, and that TPP, the TransPacific Partnership, is almost as bad.""By a nearly two-to-one margin, voters said that they agreed with Trump (50% said they agreed versus 30% who said they disagreed).Additionally, during the debate, Clinton misrepresented her longstanding support for the TPP, insisting that she had not previously praised the TPP as the ""gold standard"" of trade deals.The Associated Press reported that Clinton's claim was not true- noting that Clinton had, in fact, said that the TPP ""set the gold standard in trade agreements.""Indeed, CNN has reported that Hillary Clinton is on the record for having praised or promoted the TPP at least 45 times.Previous polling from Breitbart/Gravis in late August found that a plurality of likely voters (46%) said that they do not ""trust Hillary Clinton when she says she would oppose the TPP as President.""By a more than three-to-one margin, voters indicated that they opposed the TPP rather than supported it (38 percent said they oppose the TPP versus only 11 percent who said they supported it).This polling data is in keeping with other separate polling, which has documented the American electorate's ""across-the-board skepticism"" of multinational, so-called ""free trade"" agreements.A recent POLITICO Pro-Harvard poll found that by a five-to-one margin, Americans believe that trade policies with other countries have lost American jobs (65% believe our trade policies have lost the U.S. jobs versus only 13% who believe our trade policies have created U.S. jobs). Politico also found that while less than a third of Americans ""say they have heard or read anything"" about the Trans Pacific Partnership agreement, ""among those who have heard of it, 63% are opposed.""Doug Kaplan, the managing partner of Gravis Marketing, said trade continues to be a potent issue in this election.""From the beginning of his campaign, Trump has tapped into the frustration with trade deals, such as NAFTA and of course, the Trans-Pacific Partnership,"" he said.""People who missed the rise of Trump also missed this frustration with trade deals, which is very serious to the voters in this cycle.""SIGN UP"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

Trump has caught up with his Democratic rival Hillary R. Clinton, with both garnering 44 percent of the electorate, according to the national Breitbart/Gravis poll conducted Oct. 4 with 1,690 registered voters.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""Trump picked up four points from our Sept. 20 poll that had Clinton with 44 percent and Trump at 40 percent and four points from our Sept. 7 and Sept. 8 poll that had Clinton with 43 percent and, again, Trump at 40 percent,"" said Doug Kaplan, the managing director of Gravis Marketing, the Florida-based polling company that executed the poll. The poll carries a 2.4 percent margin of error with a 95 percent level of confidence.""We are one month out from election and although there are two other candidates in the national mix, we are seeing the power of the binary choice force shy Trump supporters to come out of hiding,"" Kaplan said.Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson was the choice of five percent and Green Party nominee Dr. Jill Stein was the choice of one percent.Democratic pollster Patrick Caddell told Breitbart News: ""This poll once again shows that when this race is contested ad hominen, or candidate versus candidate, Trump has trouble with Clinton-their unfavorables are both very high-but, if Trump was to line up with the attitudes revealed in this poll, he could have a landslide win.""Caddell said,""If Trump could deal with her more strongly on her as a representative of the overall corruption of Washington and Washington's contempt for the American people-all of the numbers show that, when you take it to that higher ground, where both Democrats and Republicans are frustrated and angry.""One example is the question asking the respondent if the candidate would fight for people like him.For Clinton, 41 percent agreed and 49 percent disagreed and for Trump 41 percent said Trump would fight for people like them, 49 percent said he would not, said Caddell, who was the pollster. Caddell advised three successive Democratic nominees in 1972, 1976, and 1980, as well as in 1984, when his candidate Gary Hart came in a close second in the roll call.In the approval ratings, 32 percent said they had a very favorable opinion of the former first lady and 47 percent said they had a very unfavorable opinion of her, he said.""This pairs up with Trump's 27 percent very favorable and 47 percent very unfavorable,"" he said.But, when they asked: ""Hillary Clinton's supporters at the Refugee Council want to increase the number of refugees coming into the United States in 2017 even more, to 200,000, and  Hillary wants to increase the number of Syrian refugees in that total from 10,000 in 2016 to 65,000 in 2017. Do you approve or disapprove of this increase?"" -- sixty-two percent were opposed and only 26 percent supported Clinton's position, he said.Respondents were asked: ""The United States will relinquish its administrative control over the Internet to a private organization where other countries, which could include China, Russia and Iran, will have influence for the first time on the management of the Internet.  Do you think this is a good idea or not?""Caddell said 71 percent said it was a bad idea and only seven percent said it was a good idea.""The next question they were asked was if the handover of the Internet was a sign of America's weakened leadership in the world,""Caddell said. ""It was a little closer, 51 percent: yes and 36 percent: no, but still that is 15 points.""On President Barack Obama's Iran Deal, 42 percent approve and 46 percent disapprove, he said. ""But, when they are asked if the Iranians are cheating now or will cheat in the future, 60 percent say yes and 14 percent say no,"" he said.""The same dynamic is in play with the president in the question. The respondents line up Democrat versus Republican, but take him out of it and their true feelings come out,"" he said.""On the the question of whether the Iranians were cheating, it is basically 5-to-1,"" he said.""This is what I mean when I talk about higher ground or the higher level,"" said the Fox News Insider.""The Clinton campaign can win a referendum on Trump; they cannot win a referendum on refugees, trade deals, or the direction of the country,"" he said.Caddell said Clinton voters are already poised to break off from her.Respondents were asked: ""Which of the following is closest to your opinion of Hillary Clinton's comments calling half of Donald Trump's supporters a ""basket of deplorables"" and calling them ""racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, you name it."" Forty-four percent said it was a major issue compared with 37 percent, who said it was not a major issue.Caddell said the next question: ""Do you think Hillary Clinton's previously mentioned comments reflect contempt for average Americans?"" went back to the candidate-against-candidate paradigm, so it came up with 46 percent agreeing and 44 percent disagreeing.Then, with the emphasis shifted from the candidates, they were asked: ""Do you think her comments are shared by many in the political establishment and major media?""This time 66 percent of respondents said they agreed and 17 percent said they disagreed.Caddell said the people are not with Clinton on the issues and they know the media is with her against the New York City developer, as well.With the next presidential debate scheduled for Sunday, this question was asked: ""At the second presidential debate on Oct. 9 between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, do you expect debate moderators Martha Raddatz of ABC and Anderson Cooper of CNN will be fair and even-handed in their treatment of both candidates, or will they be biased in favor of one candidate?""Fifty-eight percent said they expect the moderators to be fair, 40 percent expect the moderators to show favoritism to Clinton-and two percent expect favoritism towards Trump.Caddell said the results from that question jumped up at him.""Usually, the Democrats will lie and say they expect the Republican to get favorable treatment-this time, none of them--Democrats, Independents --are even pretending that the moderators would be giving Trump a break,"" he said.""In the vice presidential debate, Mike Pence was strongest when he moved the discussion to those issues, where the American people are in synch with Trump as a change agent,"" he said. ""On the other side, Tim Kaine was the most effective when he steered the discussion back to Trump, Trump, Trump,"" Caddell said.The danger for Trump is that he has not yet nailed down this dynamic to his advantage, which opens up an opportunity for Clinton to make her own pivot, Caddell said.""If Clinton breaks with Obama on Obamacare, or more likely, on refugees, she becomes the change agent without losing her base because she has political immunity from the Left,"" he said.""Were this to play out-and it might because the people running the Clinton campaign are very smart-Clinton would be pivoting to becoming the change agent at the same time all the Republican geniuses-who have been wrong all year-would have Trump making peace with the establishment.""The sample was made up of 39 percent Democrats, 33 percent Republicans, and 28 percent Independents.The poll was conducted with random automated phone calls.

Mike Pence, obviously, because he seemed to understand just how annoying and tedious the whole thing was with Tim Kaine constantly butting in like a little loser twerp on the playground who has confused ""having all the answers"" with ""being cool.""But who really won? Nobody. Except maybe Major League Baseball, which saw a massive surge of starved television refugees wandering hopelessly through the channels, shellshocked by boredom, trying to get away from the mindless blather that was sucking the life out of any poor soul who tried to watch the debate.Who won? Certainly not the American people, who have grown fat and spoiled on the great political spectacle that has been this year's presidential race. What that debate was really missing was a showman. Someone with a sense of timing. Comedic skill. Some daring. Someone who knows how to deliver a cutting insult and sell himself in any situation.What that debate lacked was, well, Donald Trump.I don't know, Mr. Trump would have been a great moderator. Maybe the Commission on Presidential Debates -- an insufferable outfit of do-gooders dedicated to boring the innocent American voter to death -- would object to such excitement on the grounds that it might benefit one of the candidates over another. Well, it's no different than letting Lester the Media Molester Holt moderate a debate with Hillary Clinton in it. It couldn't be any more unfair than what we saw from that moderator lady here in Farmville.But, okay, fine, don't let Donald Trump moderate the debate. How about letting him be time-keeper? He could sit between Howdy Doody Kaine and Glass of Warm Milk Pence and keep track of how much each politician spouted their political pablum.Mr. Trump could make duck lips, close his eyes and nod approvingly when Mr. Pence said his political words. And when Mr. Kaine made political words, Mr. Trump could stop his nodding, droop his head a little and pop open his mouth and eyes.He would not have to utter a word and the whole thing would be a thousand times more interesting.To be honest, the only one who really seemed to enjoy the debate was Mr. Kaine's large left eyebrow. Did you see that thing?It was jumping and dancing and fluttering and at one point strapped on black leotards and pink leggings and broke into an entire yoga routine with arched back hissing cat and downward dog and then stretching fruit tree.Mr. Kaine's left eyebrow consumed so much of Mr. Kaine's political face energy that it threatened to entirely shut down whole right side of Mr. Kaine's face, which nearly went completely limp. That poor, flaccid right eye, hooded by a sleepy and sluggish eyebrow would go dim as his left eyebrow danced and pirouetted across his political forehead.The enthusiastic eyebrow got so worked up at several points during the debate that it nearly became dislodged fromMr. Kaine's face. It pulled away from his face and stretched open his eye socket so far that it looked like Mr. Kaine's left eyeball might just pop out of his political head and go rolling around on the Commission on Presidential Debates-approved political debate table.That would certainly have made political history and been most unfortunate for Mr. Kaine and his long-suffering family. But at least it would have been interesting to watch.* Charles Hurt can be reached at charleshurt@live.com; follow him on Twitter via @charleshurt.SIGN UPMondayMonday"	['Pence', 'Kaine', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Hurt']	[]

Bush Urges Americans to Vote, But Doesn’t Say for Whom	"After controversies over rumored support for Hillary Clinton by his father, brother, and daughter, former President George W. Bush recently appeared in a new TV ad urging Americans to get out and vote in November's general election, but in doing so he carefully avoided endorsing anyone.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThus far W has remained silent on whom he intends to vote for in November, but in a new get out the vote video (GOTV) by NBC and Lin-Manuel Miranda, the producer, writer and, star of Broadway's Hamilton, George W. Bush joins his wife, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and a list of actors and other notables in urging Americans to go vote.During his spot in the GOTV ad, W tells viewers, ""Our future depends upon you casting a ballot.""The ad wraps up its celebrity advocates with President Barack Obama saying, ""if you're inspired by Hamilton, if you're inspired by our founders, understand that the system of government they designed only works if you participate.""But the GOTV ad comes on the heels of months of intrigue over whether or not the entire Bush clan will support the nominee of their own party, or, as rumors insist, some will vote for Donald Trump's rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton.For months former GOP candidate for president Jeb Bush, son of president George H.W. Bush and former Governor of Florida, has been saying he won't vote for Donald Trump despite vows by many of his rivals to support the GOP nominee no matter whom it was to be.Even after Donald Trump essentially won the GOP nomination for president, Jeb petulantly insisted that he would never vote for Trump. And at the end of September, Jeb reiterated his refusal to support the party by insisting that Republicans should stay home in November because, in his estimation, not voting would make a ""powerful political statement.""Jeb's super rich, establishment donors have followed the lead of their preferred candidate. One Bush donor pledged to donate a whopping $2 million to Hillary's Latino outreach program to help her get elected in November.Texas Land Commissioner and Jeb's son, George P. Bush, has also been cagy about whether or not he will support Donald Trump. Months ago he seemed to be saying Republicans should refuse to cast a ballot for Trump, but more recently he said it is important to stop Hillary, so Republicans should ""swallow a bitter pill"" and vote Trump.In addition, only days ago W's daughter, Barbara, was caught attending a $5,000-a-ticket Hilary fundraiser in France, causing many to speculate that she is supporting Hillary for president this year.But the story that made the biggest splash was the rumor that former President George H.W. Bush had decided to vote for Hillary.The story splashed across the media in September when Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, a daughter of Robert Kennedy, claimed the elder Bush told her at a private gathering that he was voting Hillary in the general election.Townsend was scolded for breaking the ex-president's trust by reporting words said in private, but many Bush detractors noted that the decision wouldn't be surprising from someone so firmly ensconced in the arrogant Washington establishment.Certainly not everyone in the Bush family orbit has turned against the Republican Party. At the end of September no less than 50 Bush appointees came out with a forceful endorsement of GOP nominee Donald Trump.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.SIGN UP"	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Kennedy', 'Paul', 'Warner', 'Obama']	[]

Her decision against the restrictions on transporting operable firearms upholds the right to carry openly.Court documents stress that the CNMI is bound by ""the Constitution, treaties, and laws of the United States."" This means constitutional provisions ""covering civil rights and liberties"" in the United States apply equally in CNMI; this includes the Second Amendment.Manglona ruled against firearm registration. She ruled that the CNMI's ban on rifles with calibers greater than .223 ""burdens the core Second Amendment right to armed self-defense"" and ""must fall."" She also struck down the ""assault weapons"" ban as regards the following rifle accessories: ""(1) pistol grips that protrude beneath the action; (2) thumbhole stocks; (3) folding or telescoping stocks; (4) flare launchers; (5) flash suppressors; and (6) forward pistol grips."" She explained the decision against the ""assault weapons"" ban by stressing the possibility that having forward grips and other accessories might actually make it easier to shoot a firearm accurately, thereby limiting the danger of stray or misplaced rounds.Manglona ruled against CNMI SAFE gun laws that limit open carry, declaring that ""the Second Amendment secures a right to bear arms for self-defense in public."" She observed that ""because SAFE completely destroys that right, it is unconstitutional regardless of the level of scrutiny applied, and the Court must strike it down. She concurred with precedent that finds certain ""limitations"" on carry to be constitutional, but observed that being subject to limitations does not translate into being ""subject to elimination.""AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

Shulkin said that the number of patients who wait over 90 days for an appointment went down by 64 percent, and most of the ones that have been waiting aren't considered urgent.Dr. Shulkin also said that many veterans received care, but the department hasn't updated its records.""VHA is strongly committed to developing long-term solutions that mitigate risks to the timeliness, cost-effectiveness, quality and safety of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system,"" he said.SIGN UP"	[]	[]

According to the official, a gag order has been imposed.A senior Abbas staffer confirmed to Breitbart Jerusalem that security measures have been stepped up ""in response to the growing incitement against him,"" but the president's agenda remains unchanged.""The president's participation in the funeral, alongside world leaders, chief among them President Obama, was crucial in countering the Israeli right's attempts to incite against the President and the Palestinians, which would have been successful had he chosen not to go,"" he said.The office of the President's spokesperson, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, declined to comment.The simmering sentiments against Abbas culminated in a funeral procession of a resident of the Balata Refugee Camp, near Nablus, where participants called on him to resign following his participation in Peres' funeral. Some, including Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades militants, chanted, ""The people want to topple the president.""Among Abbas' high-profile critics was Father Manuel Musallam, the head of the Catholic Church in the Gaza Strip, who said that by attending Peres' funeral ""Abbas allowed Israel to complete the occupation of Palestine.""""Today you ruined the Palestinian national project,"" he said. ""Today, the Palestinian Authority and its institutions ceased to exist. Today, you removed yourself from the hearts of the seekers of freedom, go look for a lid to cover the cave you share with the Israeli thieves.

As part of this effort, Western and Arab officials have lobbied the international community and the UN to strike down the law, which is ostensibly ""in violation of the principle of equality before the law and a shattering of the basics of International Law and the UN conventions"" and ""removes injustice and spreads anarchy.""The paper quoted Oleg Ozerov, the Russian Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, as saying that ""Moscow adamantly opposed the law, because it clearly contradicts all the principles of International Law. Unfortunately, the whole world has seen over the last few years how American policy violated International Law and how it veered from every international convention. The Americans insist on the right they have wrongfully claimed to be above International Law. Moscow is well aware of this policy, following its special experience with America on the international level.""Bertrand Besancenot, the French Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, also told the paper that his country opposes the law ""because we are aware of the shockwaves it will send, namely undermining peace and security around the world.""Besancenot added that he hoped Congress would take into account the problems the law would bring and reverse its decision.Jamal Shamykeh, Jordan's Ambassador, said that the law would infringe on the sovereignty of many countries, predominantly Arab.""The fact that President [Barack] Obama opposes it shows that it is a controversial law that was passed without sufficient debate,"" he said. ""We are on the same page with the Saudi government, because this law is a dangerous precedent that would encourage some countries to meddle in the internal affairs of others, especially America, because anybody could sue them.""The ambassadors of Egypt, Pakistan and Sudan were also quoted as opposing the law, with Egyptian Ambassador Nasser Hamdi warning the United States against ""the adventure of gambling on its strategic relationship with Saudi Arabia,"" adding that the two countries pay the price of being at the forefront of the war on terror.Meanwhile, the Saudi news site SABQ quoted Alan Dibb, an American living in southern Saudi Arabia, near the Yemeni border. Dibb didn't refer to the faceoff between Washington and Riyadh directly, but praised Saudi Arabia and its people.""As someone who has spent the last four years training Saudi educators, I love the nature and the landscape in Saudi Arabia and admire its people, who are polite and always happy to help,"" he was quoted as saying .Dibb, who lives in the region of Jazan, said he felt much safer living next door to the fighting in Yemen than he did in Los Angeles. ""When the Saudi police ask me to leave, I do it. I'm mainly concerned with the damage the war inflicts on ordinary people.""He added that there is good and bad, just like everywhere. ""I live and work with Muslims. We all follow the teachings of Abraham about hospitality, kindness and fairness to others, as well as praying and worshiping God.""He said he called on Americans and Saudis to treat each other with respect ""even though we are often unable to understand each other.

23	23	http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/05/alaska-think-growing-government-grow-economy/	In Alaska, Some Think Growing Government Would Grow the Economy	"Nobody quite knows how, but Alaska's House of Representatives continues to hold the line against a plan that would halve the annual payments the government makes to citizens and use the funds to close a growing state budget gap.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAlaska's Future, a coalition of Chamber of Commerce types and trade unions led by GCI, the state's dominant cable and telecom company, spent nearly $2 million in an all-fronts lobbying/influence effort. Alaska's state senate approved the measure, 14-5. Its governor, Bill Walker twice called the House back into session to try to get to a yes vote.But none of that could get the House to budge on the plan, which would have reduced the annual payment from oil and gas royalties the state provides to residents from about $2,000 to around $1,000.So the governor took it upon himself and simply vetoed half the money the legislature appropriated for the permanent fund dividends, or PFDs as Alaskans call them, and capped this coming year's PFD at $1,000 per person.He then sought to apply that money - about $696 million - toward the budget deficit and made up the rest with money from a state savings fund. But it's unclear this is legal, and lawsuits already have been filed to stop it. Even if it was found legal to veto that portion of the PFD, it also is not clear it is legal to transfer that money to the general fund, as the governor wants to do.The focus in the 49th state is on what went wrong. The budget deficit, which some say actually may be as high as $3.8 billion, is real and growing and getting worse, they say. Alaska's Future points out that about 90 percent of Alaska's revenues come from oil, but those revenues have fallen significantly in recent years because both production and prices have fallen dramatically.The state government has poured more than $50 billion into the Permanent Fund since oil began flowing through the Alaska Pipeline in the 1970s, and it's time, say Alaska's Future and others, to draw some out to meet immediate budget expenses.But for now, the House won't budge. Some say members are against reducing the PFD. Others say they want to hold the line on spending. But many continue to ask: How did GCI and its Alaska's Future partners spend all that money, hire all those lobbyists, make all those six-figure ad buys and still not get the House to go along?But perhaps that is not the question to ask. The question is why this solution in the first place? Alaska is the most dependent state in the country on government spending. The economy of its capital city, Juneau, is almost wholly dependent on a robust state government, one with more employees per capita than any other state.Walker, GCI and Alaska's Future argue the state's livelihood depends on reducing the payment to residents, who can spend the money as they like, and increasing funding for government services.""When the Alaska economy weakens, GCI, our employees, our customers, and all Alaskans suffer together,"" wrote Greg Chapados, executive vice president and chief operating officer for GCI in an op-ed piece in the Juneau Empire newspaper. The decline in oil prices and oil-related economic activity, coupled with the associated cutback in the state of Alaska's capital budget, threaten to push Alaska into a recession. The decisions the governor and the Alaska State Legislature make this year will have a profound impact on the economic outlook for the state.""The governor says the economy must broaden beyond the energy sector, which is true, but that companies will be reluctant to move to Alaska if it funds only 80 percent of its state government needs and looks to those companies for the other 20 percent.But let's say I have a million bucks, and you need a few hundred to cover your rent this month. You really need rent covered, and a few hundred out of a million is no big deal. But what about next month? Or the month after? At some point, I'll be out of money and you'll still need help. What happens then? Shouldn't you figure out how to make ends meet with existing resources now?Because that's what the governor is asking for here. He wants to remove what he considers an unnecessary restraint on state spending. He wants to do so because he believes the economic vitality of his state depends on a level of spending his constituents have said, through their representatives, they are unwilling to fund.The truth is Alaska's economy would be helped by reducing dependence on government, accepting the will of the House and leaving the Permanent Fund as just that - a permanent fund to ensure Alaska's viability.The House is standing against him for now, but GCI and its partners have vowed to be back. Will Alaska tackle its state spending problem? Or will it continue to kick the can down the road with gimmicks such as this?""The success of our company, our 2,200 Alaska employees, and our state economy depends upon a sound fiscal plan,"" said GCI spokesperson Heather Handyside.It does depend on a sound fiscal plan, but that's not what the governor and his friends at Alaska's Future have proposed.SIGN UP"	[]	[]

[It] couldn't have been more stark.""Although Kaine had home state advantage during the debate in Farmville, Virginia, a CNN poll found more people thought Pence won the debate.Stewart said Kaine's exchange about September 11 was ""embarrassing"" and may influence some Virginia voters.""When Pence was talking about 9-11 and Kaine said, 'Well, I was there. I was [lieutenant] governor at that point,' and Pence coolly looked at him and said, 'I understand that,' I thought that was kind of a constructive moment,"" Stewart critiqued.""Virginia was reminded last night that Kaine was not a good governor,"" he added, saying Pence ""reminded Virginians that the Kaine years were really bad years -- a $4 billion tax increase, rising unemployment, a loss of tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs -- and I think that's really going to hurt him in the sense that it reminds Virginians that Kaine is not a good executive.""SIGN UP"	['Pence', 'Stewart', 'Kaine']	[]

On July 25, 1980, Richard Lee Whitley strangled his 63-year-old neighbor Pheobe Parsons, slashed her throat, and sexually assaulted her corpse with two umbrellas.

Horan Jr. called the savage murder of Parsons, a widow, ""unbelievably brutal.""But at the time, Kaine, working as Whitley's lawyer, opined to reporters: ""Murder is wrong in the gulag, in Afghanistan, in Soweto, in the mountains of Guatemala, in Fairfax County... and even the Spring Street Penitentiary."" Kaine also argued that his client's IQ of only 75 meant he was ""insane"" and ""feebleminded,"" and Whitley should be sent to a mental hospital.Lee was put to death on the electric chair in 1987. The day Virginia executed him, Kaine stood outside the prison to say a ""piece of him"" also died along with the murderer:Carrying a Bible, Kaine offered the television cameras a prayer for what he said was a society that would execute a brain-damaged man who had a diminished ability to see that murder is wrong. But it wasn't even that perceived injustice that bothered Kaine so much.Two days earlier, while waiting for word on Whitley's last chance for a stay of execution, Kaine said, ""If Spring Street wasn't there and the chair wasn't there, you can still look around Richmond and see an awful lot of pain.""For somebody who has a view like mine"" about life, said the 29-year- old Harvard University law graduate, ""the pain is a very real thing. ... Something personal in me will die, too,"" when Whitley dies.""There are a lot of little deaths in that way every day.""Lem Davis Tuggle
(CLEMENT BRITT/RICHMOND TIMES-DISPATCH)""[Lem] Tuggle, whose arm was emblazoned with a 'Born to Die' tattoo, was convicted of murdering Jessie Geneva Havens, 52, of Smyth County, Va., in 1983. Havens was raped, sodomized and shot in the chest only four months after Tuggle was paroled from a 20-year sentence for the 1971 murder of a 17-year-old girl,"" the Washington Post reported on December 13, 1996, the day after Virginia executed Tuggle.But Kaine, in his defense of Tuggle, tried to argue that Tuggle forcibly sodomizing Havens did not amount to rape -- in order to reduce the capital murder charge to murder and let Tuggle escape the death penalty. The Fourth Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals, however, ruled that Kaine and other petitioners' attempts to claim that there wasn't enough evidence to show Havens was raped and sodomized ""was clearly erroneous.""The terror and pain Havens suffered at Tuggle's hands before her violent death, detailed by the Court, showed that beyond a doubt she had been raped:An autopsy revealed that the victim's body had an abrasion and a bruise on the left frontal area of the forehead, a small abrasion on the right frontal area of the forehead, an abrasion on the neck, a bite mark on the lower, inner quadrant of the right breast, a number of small bruises on the upper, inner aspect of the right arm, and a bruise on the right thumb and right wrist. Havens also had sustained a large bruise on the upper, inner thigh, bruises on the vaginal vault at the posterior aspect and near the bottom, and a gunshot wound in the chest.According to the medical examiner, ""the bruises of the vagina indicate penetration of the vaginal vault by something, a penis, a finger, an object, something."" The medical examiner testified that both the bite mark on the breast and the bruising around the vagina occurred while Havens was alive. He also testified that no semen or spermatozoa was found in Havens' vagina, but that semen was found in the rectum, indicating ""penetration and ejaculation into the rectum.""A forensic odontologist testified that he examined the bite mark on the victim's right breast. He compared the mark with models of Tuggle's teeth and concluded ""with all medical certainty these marks on the body of Ms. Havens were made by the teeth of Mr. Tuggle."" He further opined that Havens was alive and moving when she was bitten.As governor, Kaine also commuted the death sentence of Percy Levar Walton, who brutally murdered Jessie E. Kendrick (80), Elizabeth W. Kendrick (81), and Archie D. Moore, Jr. (33) while robbing them.Kaine canceled Walton's execution last minute, writing a long statement explaining that executing the triple-murderer would be ""unconstitutional,"" since Walton, who pled guilty, didn't understand why he was being put to death:""The courts have emphasized, however, that it is unconstitutional to execute a person who is mentally incompetent. The late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. wrote in the seminal case of Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 399 (1986), that the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution 'forbids the execution of those who are unaware of the punishment they are about to suffer and why they are to suffer it.' He further concluded that the execution of a mentally incompetent inmate would be a 'uniquely cruel penalty' where the inmate could not comprehend that they are about to die and could not 'prepare, mentally and spiritually' for the execution.""Thus, the question of Walton's mental status is of the utmost importance in assessing whether the Commonwealth may carry out his death sentence. For this reason, the court system has wrestled with the question of whether Walton's mental capacity imposes a bar to his execution. Notwithstanding consistent decisions upholding his conviction, the courts found it necessary to carefully examine whether Walton's death sentence could be carried out consistent with the U.S. Constitution.Needless to say, Walton's victims did not prepare ""mentally and spiritually"" for their violent deaths at Walton's hands.  
(Photo: AP)The families of the victims were furious at Kaine for allowing their loved ones' murderer to live.""I don't think he deserves it. He broke into my sister's house and killed them execution style. He had them kneel. He knew what he was doing,"" Irene Jurscaga, Elizabeth Kendrick's sister, told the Washington Post in 2008. ""He knew how to kill and hide his gun and take my brother-in-law's car. My sister begged him for her life.""Kaine's lifelong commitment to sparing violent killers from punishment comes into sharper focus as crime, particularly murder, has begun to rise in the U.S. since 2014, reversing a decades-long downward trend. Carrying a Bible, Kaine offered the television cameras a prayer for what he said was a society that would execute a brain-damaged man who had a diminished ability to see that murder is wrong. But it wasn't even that perceived injustice that bothered Kaine so much.
Two days earlier, while waiting for word on Whitley's last chance for a stay of execution, Kaine said, ""If Spring Street wasn't there and the chair wasn't there, you can still look around Richmond and see an awful lot of pain.
""For somebody who has a view like mine"" about life, said the 29-year- old Harvard University law graduate, ""the pain is a very real thing. ... Something personal in me will die, too,"" when Whitley dies.

During his re-election bid, President Barack Obama's campaign set up a public relations initiative titled ""The Life of Julia,"" in which a composite woman named Julia was shown to fare better throughout her life because of policies promoted by Obama over those of his then-opponent, Republican Mitt Romney.As Breitbart News reported at the time, Julia's story begins when she is three years old, and is enrolled in a government-run Head Start program. Of course, she attends public schools in which the Race to the Top-funded Common Core standards help her to be ""college and career ready."" Upon graduating from high school, Julia obtains taxpayer-funded student loans for college. Amazingly, Julia actually gets a job in the Obama economy, though it's not specified if it's in the public or private sector.Along the way, when Julia needs surgery, she needn't worry about the cost of healthcare, said Obama's campaign, because Obamacare provides coverage for people like her. Also, Obama's signature health reform provides free contraception so Julia can decide to have a child - with no mention of a ""father"" - at age 31 - all paid for by American taxpayers.Julia's son eventually attends government public schools that Obama's education policies have refurbished.Eventually, Julia qualifies for an Obama Small Business Administration loan, so taxpayers can help her start her own business. Ultimately, she turns 65 and can finally be on government-run Medicare for the remainder of her life - the length of which could be determined by Medicare rationing. At age 67, she begins to collect government-run Social Security - all paid for by other American taxpayers.There you have it - the life of the Democrats' ideal American woman - almost entirely funded by other taxpayers - and no thought (or other people) required.Hillary Clinton affirmed ""The Life of Julia"" on Tuesday when she reached out in Haverford, Pennsylvania - with daughter Chelsea in tow - to an audience of mostly women, young people, and children, promising to make Julia's life their own.""We have to look at the whole life cycle,"" Clinton said at the town hall gathering, pitching taxpayer help for women struggling with low-paying jobs, raising their children, and with gun violence in their neighborhoods. Clinton said she will also be there for black mothers dealing with law enforcement targeting their children, and will provide paid family leave and paid sick days.There was plenty of empathy to go around.""It should not be so hard to be a young parent,"" Clinton said. ""And it should not be so hard on the other end of the age spectrum to take care of your loved one.""""People say, 'I can't get the help I need for myself, my spouse, my child,'"" she said. ""There's just not enough help,"" she added, painting American women as ""Julias"" who can't figure out how to live without the federal government's - aka American taxpayers' - assistance.""Women tell me these stories about how hard it is,"" she said. ""They tell me not only do they have no paid family leave, they have no earned sick days.""Ironically, while speaking in Haverford, Clinton included in the federal ""help"" she offered women, lots of ""pregnancy"" and ""pre-natal"" care, but never mentioned that she intends to also ""help"" them abort their babies by repealing the Hyde Amendment, a longstanding federal provision that bars taxpayer funding of most abortions. Clinton apparently is not up for ""helping"" young female babies in the womb if their mothers decide they are a ""mistake.""On Tuesday night, Clinton's running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine, continued to represent himself as a Catholic - much along the lines of Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden - who couches his obvious break with his faith in euphemisms like ""trusting women,"" all made to order for Julias looking for validation for abortion.   [VIDEO]""We support Roe vs. Wade,"" Kaine said. ""We support the constitutional right of American women to consult their own conscience, their own supportive partner, their own minister, but then make their own decision about pregnancy. That's something we trust American women to do that...""This is still ""The Life of Julia,"" of course, with only a ""supportive partner,"" and no real ""father"" on the scene.""In response to a question about conflicts between faith and public life, Senator Kaine enthusiastically jettisoned the core teaching of his faith on the dignity of the human person, fully endorsing a policy of unrestricted abortion on demand,"" reacted Maureen Ferguson, senior policy advisor with The Catholic Association.It remains to be seen whether Julia's life - complete with taxpayer-funded abortion, as the Clinton-Kaine ticket promises - will be supported by Americans on Election Day. A recent Marist poll found that a majority of Americans - 62 percent - oppose taxpayer funding of abortion, including 45 percent of those who say they are ""pro-choice,"" and 44 percent of Democrats.Penny Nance, president & CEO of Concerned Women for America, says Kaine's maneuver to abandon his faith principles on abortion, while still hawking his struggle with the death penalty, shows his political maneuvering.""I find it odd that a man of faith who says he struggled with allowing the death penalty because of his faith, is also pro-abortion,"" Nance says. ""He seems to have no qualms about losing the lives of the most vulnerable and unprotected in our society, the unborn.""""Women are strong and able, but the so-called 'pro-choice' community often takes advantage of women at a very vulnerable time in their life and only promotes one option - abortion,"" she adds.But, it's clear how Clinton is using Kaine.""The Catholic vote is going to be absolutely critical to our success,"" Kaine said recently, urging other ""Catholic"" Julias to support the Clinton campaign.SIGN UP"	['Clinton', 'Romney', 'Roe', 'Kaine', 'Pelosi', 'Obama']	['abortion']
27	27	http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/05/tim-kaines-gun-control-positions-years/	Tim Kaine’s Gun Control Positions Through The Years	"Tim Kaine has held public office off and on in some capacity since 1994 and has consistently pushed gun control for law-abiding citizens along the way.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIn 1994 Kaine was a Richmond City councilman. In that capacity he ""supported legislation that included a ban on commonly-owned firearms and their magazines."" As with all gun controls, this ban would have only applied to law-abiding citizens.The NRA outlined some of Kaine's other gun control pushes:In March 2008-less than a year after the horrible April 16, 2007, attack on innocents in Virginia Tech gun-free zones-Kaine vetoed legislation that would have allowed law-abiding citizens to keep a gun in their car for purposes of self-defense. The idea behind the bill was that students in gun-free zones could have at least fled to their cars to retrieve their guns for self-defense in the event of an attack.Additionally, Breitbart News reported that Kaine supported Senator Joe Manchin's (D-WV) post-Sandy Hook gun control push in 2013, expanding background checks to include persons on the terror watch list in December 2015. He also supported a bill to allow the Attorney General to sidestep due process requirements and bar gun possession for certain Americans in June 2016.In September 2015, Senator Kaine pushed legislation that would punish licensed gun sellers for crimes committed with guns that were legally manufactured and legally sold. In other words, the gun seller would be liable even in cases where background checks were performed and passed by the buyer.Yet during Tuesday night's vice presidential debate, Kaine described himself as a ""strong Second Amendment supporter.""AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio. Follow him on Twitter: @AWRHawkins. Reach him directly at awrhawkins@breitbart.com.

In 2000, as Mayor of Richmond, ""Kaine spent $6,000 in public funds to transporting residents in eight city buses to the anti-gun Million Mom March event in Washington DC.""
While campaigning for the office of Lt. Governor in 2001, Kaine ""opposed repealing Virginia's one-gun-a-month purchase [limit].""
In 2005, while running for Governor of Virginia, Kaine ""supported closing the so-called 'gun show loophole.'"" Such a loophole does not exist, but has been a Democrat talking point for decades nonetheless. It allows gun control advocates to continue pushing an expansion of background checks.
Also in 2005, Kaine ""continued to support Virginia's one-gun-a-month law.""
As Governor in 2006 Kaine ""vetoed right-to-carry legislation.""
In 2007 ""Kaine supported allowing government authorities 'monitor' people who buy ammunition.""

But global economic growth, at 3.1 percent, is expected to be twice as strong as the U.S. rate in 2016, improve to 3.4 percent in 2017, and then continue to outperform.IMF economists point to the U.S. elections and the Brexit vote as related phenomena that reflect ""political discord and inward-looking politics"" as the main threat to further worsening in the global economic outlook.The IMF highlights the fact that international trade growth has dramatically slowed since 2012, and has been running at a negative -3 to -5 percent since 2015. The IMF blames this global change for a substantial slowdown of investment that ""has been the primary restraint on trade growth, accounting for up to three-fourths of the slowdown."" The IMF sees this trend causing weak ""productivity and growth.""The IMF notes Donald Trump's economic arguments, stating: ""Concerns about the impact of foreign competition on jobs and wages in a context of weak growth have enhanced the appeal of protectionist policy approaches, with potential ramifications for global trade flows and integration more broadly.""That is economist-speak for angry people that used to make a very good manufacturing wage in places like the U.S. Rust Belt and the British Midlands, and who may be gaining the political upper hand in rebelling against globalized outsourcing of their jobs to the Third World.The IMF suggests that advanced nations could subdue this rebellion with even greater welfare and entitlement spending policies that support ""trade adjustment assistance programs and effective support for retraining, skill building, and occupational and geographic mobility could play an important role in certain cases.""After four decades of pushing globalization as a great way to improve the lives of billions of people in developing nations, the IMF seems to be listening, at least, to voices articulating the negative plight of millions of American workers.SIGN UP"	[]	[]
