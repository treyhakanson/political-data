The term covers men identifying as women or women as men, but also includes ""gender fluid"" persons who can identity as male on one day but a female on another day. It also includes ""intersex""--people who refuse to ever be ""confined"" to identifying as male or female. There are other variations beyond these four.High school student ""G.G."" is a biological girl who calls herself a boy and dresses as a boy, with the support of her mother. They asked the teachers and the staff at student's school in Gloucester County, Va., to call her by a boy's name and allow her to use the boys' facilities.School officials tried to accommodate G.G., calling her by her preferred boy's name. But they asked that she use the unisex bathroom in the nurse's office rather than endorse her claimed right to use the boys' bathrooms and locker rooms alongside biological boys and adult men.But then G.G. changed her mind and decided she felt stigmatized by using a unisex bathroom, and demanded the school approve her use of the boys' bathrooms and locker rooms at the same time as biological males are using those facilities. This demand goes to the heart of the transgender ideology, which says that government should require states, agencies, companies and individuals to accept the claims by transgender people that they be treated as members of the opposite sex.The matter went to the school board, which adopted the policy that everyone must either use the facilities matching their biological sex, or instead use a single-person unisex bathroom.G.G. sued, arguing that Title IX of federal law requires schools to allow anyone to use whichever facilities they identify with.During the lawsuit, she got a low-ranking Obama administration official--James Ferg-Cadima, who was an acting deputy assistant secretary of education--to send her a private letter agreeing with her position.The federal district court ruled in favor of the school administrators, but a three-judge panel of the U.S. court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit--a panel with two liberals and one conservative--reversed in a 2-1 decision. The panel's liberal majority held that the term ""sex"" in Title IX and Education Department regulations is ambiguous and has no clear meaning, and therefore that courts should defer to Ferg-Cadima's private letter as an authoritative declaration of law.Since then, President Obama's Justice Department and Education Department have made an official statement that both Title IX and Title VII--which prohibits almost every employer in America from discriminating on the basis of sex--requires all schools and employers to embrace transgenderism, and that anyone who declines to do so can be prosecuted or sanctioned for violating federal law.Almost half of the states in the nation are currently suing the Obama administration over this issue. In that case of Texas v. U.S., a federal judge ruled in favor of the states, which the Justice Department is now appealing to the Fifth Circuit appeals court.Several other similar lawsuits are ongoing in North Carolina, where liberals are suing over a state law, HB 2, under which people use public restrooms corresponding to their original or changed sex marked on their original or updated birth certificate.And in another case, Board of Education of the Highland Local School District v. U.S. Dep't of Education, a liberal federal judge in Ohio recently went much further, ruling that school policies that do not embrace transgenderism violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, a decision now being appealed to the Sixth Circuit appeals court.But this case of Gloucester County School Board v. G.G. ex rel. Grimm can be decided on a much narrower basis. The justices could rule that private letters by low-ranking officials written to influence a lawsuit are not entitled to any deference by a federal court, and send the case back to the lower court for a new legal analysis.This issue comes too late to be a major issue in the 2016 presidential election. But the transgender agenda is now going before the nation's highest court, and the next president--Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton--will appoint the ninth justice who may be the tiebreaking vote on this issue, one that will spread to every school, restaurant, and workplace in America.Gloucester County's case will likely be heard around March 2017, with a decision by the end of June unless the Supreme Court still have only eight justices. It will likely deadlock 4-4 in the case.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

The research firm added 253 exchange customers to the sample to provide broader findings.SIGN UP"

It was the cover-up that led to Nixon's downfall, not the break-in.The FBI investigation has already revealed Hillary Clinton's perjury, and a new investigation of additional classified documents shared through her personal email server can lead to criminal indictments--unless the FBI itself wants to fall on its sword in a far more visible and viral cover-up than we have seen to date.It is not at all clear that the FBI has not already been hopelessly compromised: Did the FBI have knowledge of Barack Obama's participation in the illegal email server and the president's lies about it to the public? Who will investigate the investigators?What happens if Clinton wins the election and is then indicted on criminal charges prior to January 20? What happens if the FBI again fails to recommend criminal charges but the House of Representatives finds her in contempt of Congress and asks the Department of Justice to prosecute her for perjury? What happens if the Congress holds up all presidential appointments and all Democrat legislation until a nonpartisan Special Prosecutor is appointed?The likelihood of a constitutional crisis grows each day that Clinton continues to lie about her classified emails and continues to avoid criminal penalties for her possible perjury. If Clinton wins the election and is sworn in as President, she can only be removed by impeachment by the House and conviction by the Senate. If Democrats win majority control of the Senate on November 8, Clinton could defy the Congress and either refuse to appoint a Special Prosecutor or appoint someone who would rubber stamp her criminal behavior.The patriotic thing for Hillary Clinton to do would be to step aside and let the DNC select Tim Kaine as the party's presidential candidate. But since that would almost certainly lead to a tidal wave of support for Donald Trump, that will not happen. The national Democrat Party is not famous for its fidelity to constitutional norms.The difference between the Watergate scandal and the Clinton perjury scandal is that in 1974, a delegation of Republican members of Congress went to Nixon and told him point blank he must resign because they would vote to remove him if he didn't. Republicans suffered devastating losses in the 1974 elections because of the Nixon resignation--even though no members of Congress were implicated in Nixon's cover-up.In the Watergate scandal, Republicans in Congress put the truth and the rule of law above politics. Democrats do not behave that way; Democrats put politics above everything, including the Constitution. Besides, the Clintons have been here before and survived. In 1998, Bill Clinton committed perjury -- and obstruction of justice - and got away with it because, as Democrat Senators admitted publicly, they would not remove one of their own for merely telling a lie. After all, they said, Bill Clinton's lie was not about policy, it was about sex with a White House intern.The national media will of course do its best to deflect public attention away from the new FBI criminal investigation. Indeed, that is already happening.Like liberal newspapers across the country, The Denver Post considers it necessary to link the FBI story to the Associated Press survey of public opinion on the veracity of the ""groping"" allegations against Trump. The media has not yet managed to find any credible allegation of criminal wrong-doing against Trump, but is working hard to divert public attention away from Clinton's newest scandal.A constitutional crisis is not entirely avoided even if Hillary Clinton loses to Donald Trump on November 8. Let's suppose President Trump asks newly appointed Attorney General Rudy Giuliani to appoint a Special Prosecutor to investigate Clinton's misuse of a private email server.A Democrat-controlled Senate could obstruct that investigation and threaten all kinds of retribution against the new President. Thus, in typical Washington fashion, a bipartisan deal would likely be struck to let Hillary off the hook--all in the name, of course, of saving taxpayer money.A very real constitutional crisis has already occurred and it is ongoing -- the transparent politicization of the FBI and the Department of Justice by the Obama team and the resulting loss of public confidence in those law enforcement institutions. Americans now have additional reasons to be wary of expanded federal powers.SIGN UP"

But first -- the poll told him -- he had to stall for time. He had to lie about it for as long as he possibly could before coming clean.And that was exactly what he did.

Ferguson added:In the last debate, Mrs. Clinton admitted she supports abortion up until the moment of birth.  There are at least 10,000 developing human beings (half of them girls) killed in the second half of pregnancy, and even the abortion lobby admits these late-term abortions are mostly elective.  If a mother has a health problem late in pregnancy, the baby can be delivered early and go to the NICU; there is no need to kill the baby to save the health of the mother.  So if Hillary Clinton is campaigning on ""women's rights"" today, she should be asked about the rights of these 5,000 girls whose lives are snuffed out every year in abortion clinics across America.Clinton is giving her due to an abortion lobby that has pumped millions of dollars into her campaign. Planned Parenthood alone has spent more than $20 million to help make Clinton the next president, and has been registering people to vote at all of its clinics, on college campuses, and online as well.However, a recently released WikiLeaks email from the account of Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta reveals the nominee's speechwriter Dan Schwerin writing that Clinton ""felt strongly"" about not defending Planned Parenthood openly last year immediately after the abortion giant's video scandal had begun.""Given the growing controversy over the leaked Planned Parenthood video, with Boehner calling for hearings and other GOPers piling on, we should think about whether this is a good time to join the battle and come to Planned Parenthood's defense, or whether it's wiser to stay away,"" Schwerin wrote. Two days later, he confirmed, ""HRC felt strongly about not touching Planned Parenthood right now.""Since the release of the Planned Parenthood video series that alleges the abortion business sells the body parts of babies aborted in its clinics for a profit, the organization has been attempting to suppress further exposure and seeking cover from its media and political allies. Clinton was the recipient of the Margaret Sanger award, Planned Parenthood's highest honor, given in memory of its eugenicist founder.Proud #NastyWomen @ilyseh, @CecileRichards & @Schriock1 are in #IA today to #GOTV for @HillaryClinton! #SheWinsWeWin #ImWithHer #IoWIN pic.twitter.com/LgWnSF7g62-- NARAL (@NARAL) October 28, 2016""Americans should ask themselves why the abortion lobby is fighting tooth and nail for Hillary Clinton this election cycle,"" suggested Dr. Grazie Pozo Christie, an advisory board member also with The Catholic Association, who added:Today, she's campaigning in Iowa with the most powerful players in the abortion lobby. These organizations know that the way to advance a radical abortion agenda is by electing Hillary Clinton. But polling shows that the majority of Americans reject such an agenda and prefer restrictions on abortions and taxpayer funding for abortions.While speaking in Iowa about women's rights, Clinton said she prepared for her debates with Donald Trump by having a staff member insult her continuously, a comment that yielded laughter from the audience. She again referenced a comment made by first lady Michelle Obama at the Democrat National Convention: ""When they go low, we go high.""Clinton said that every policy Trump talks about contains ""disrespect"" and ""contempt"" for women.""Make no mistake, women's health and rights - our futures and the futures of our daughters and granddaughters - are on the ballot,"" Clinton asserted, reminding her audience that Trump said he would appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade and return the issue of abortion to the states.""He promised to defund Planned Parenthood, to wipe away the healthcare services that millions of women get for cancer screenings and so many other necessary help,"" she said. ""I just have to say we have come too far to let Donald Trump take us back, haven't we?""Though Clinton and other Democrats continuously reference ""cancer screenings"" as a service offered by Planned Parenthood, in 2015, Cecile Richards testified before the House Oversight Committee that her organization does not provide mammograms.Clinton said she saw the way women were treated in other countries - ""marginalized and sidelined"" - and said the United States must continue to set the example. She said she responds, ""Deal me in"" to anyone who says standing up for women's rights is playing the ""woman card.""However, even though countries such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar are well known for their horrific records of violence against women and for engaging in human trafficking, the Clinton Foundation accepted millions of dollars in donations from them.The Democrat nominee continued her Iowa speech with promises for a hike in the minimum wage and federal funding for childcare and paid family leave because ""families are under so much stress today.""""I keep meeting people who are really under tremendous pressure,"" Clinton said, though she also continues to say the Obama presidency has made significant progress in the country and that she hopes to stay on the same path.Clinton also said that - if elected - she would finally guarantee ""equal pay for women's work."" However, another email from Podesta's account shows that, in February of last year, a Clinton campaign staffer detailed that the Clinton Foundation had a $190,000 pay gap between the highest paid men and women.Today I'll be in Iowa today with @ilyseh @Schriock1 - and @HillaryClinton.

Many members of the Cuban community have either lived under the communist Castro regime or have immediate family members who did. Hillary Rodham Clinton and her actions remind them [Cubans] of the brutal regime they fled. Friday's revelations by the FBI further deepen the Castro connection for many with whom Breitbart News spoke.According to Carlos Arias, founder of Cubans for Trump:Well, Karma's a B***h just like 'Her.' If you're 'With Her,' you're enabling the right to be a felon, thief, and a lyin' witch (Bruja Mentirosa in Spanish). You could only lie for so many years. Also, the Clinton Foundation can't pay the FBI enough since its Director's integrity is on the line. He's not going to take the fall for someone who could obviously care less about anyone but herself or her corrupt family. She defends and enables a rapist husband and she could care less about the needs of Americans. Her attacks lack any basic foundation of truth and are oftentimes fabricated in order to further brainwash the masses. Enough is enough. Justice will be served, before or after Trump is elected. It's time for tangible legitimate change! Hillary in prison would only further America's advance to be both relevant and great once more!When asked if Clinton's behavior reminds him of the Castros, Arias responded, ""Strikingly similar yes. She's pushing a socialist agenda where the government knows what's best for us and we have little to no say. Very much like communist Cuba. The silent majority is fed up. Go vote early like I did. Let's show her that our country still has hope and patriotism. Unlike her.""Co-founders of the Facebook group Cubans4Trump, Jose Uz and Ariel Martinez think:They know TRUMP is winning, case is reopened -- November 8th TRUMP wins, November 9th Hillary's indicted -- if Obama pardons her before he leaves office, she's is off the hook and the Obama/ Clinton legacy is that power allows you to be above the law. If my layman prediction is correct, it will be a black eye for America and it's history of being a country ruled by laws not by man. None the less, this could be the October surprise that'll become the excuse for Hillary's loss.When asked if Clinton's behavior reminds them of the Castros, Uz and Martinez responded, ""absolutely Cuba is not defined by the rule of law, neither is North Korea, Venezuela and the like.

If you're 'With Her,' you're enabling the right to be a felon, thief, and a lyin' witch (Bruja Mentirosa in Spanish). You could only lie for so many years. Also, the Clinton Foundation can't pay the FBI enough since its Director's integrity is on the line. He's not going to take the fall for someone who could obviously care less about anyone but herself or her corrupt family. She defends and enables a rapist husband and she could care less about the needs of Americans. Her attacks lack any basic foundation of truth and are oftentimes fabricated in order to further brainwash the masses. Enough is enough. Justice will be served, before or after Trump is elected. It's time for tangible legitimate change! Hillary in prison would only further America's advance to be both relevant and great once more!They know TRUMP is winning, case is reopened -- November 8th TRUMP wins, November 9th Hillary's indicted -- if Obama pardons her before he leaves office, she's is off the hook and the Obama/ Clinton legacy is that power allows you to be above the law. If my layman prediction is correct, it will be a black eye for America and it's history of being a country ruled by laws not by man. None the less, this could be the October surprise that'll become the excuse for Hillary's loss.Now we have four things to watch everyday: The FBI Investigation, WikiLeaks, Podesta Emails, and the Project Veritas videos.

Massaquoi was extradited from the Philadelphia area where she had moved earlier this year and is currently being held without bond in Alexandria.In the Sunshine State, two separate suspects were charged with voter fraud, one of whom is a 74-year-old white woman from Westchester, FL.Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle charged the elderly Gladys Coego with filling out votes for a mayoral candidate while working as an official counter of absentee ballots. Coego admitted to her actions when asked and was charged with two felony counts of marking another person's ballot, according to Reuters.In a second Florida case, authorities charged Tomika Curgil, a 33-year-old African-American woman from Liberty City, with filling out voter registration information for five voters without their consent and submitting 17 more registrations for fictitious people, ABC News 10 reported.Authorities said Curgil was working for a group working to legalize marijuana called People United for Medical Marijuana.Investigators alleged that despite never venturing out from her home on her ""work day"" for the voter registration drive, Curgil nonetheless handed in the stack of registrations.Curgil was charged with five counts of submitting false voter registration information.Warnings of voter fraud have been a central issue in GOP nominee Donald Trump's campaign for the White House by warning voters to be on the lookout for examples of a system that is ""rigged"" against him.

Andrew Breitbart's willingness to take on stories that the establishment media wouldn't touch eventually made it impossible for the media to ignore.Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton's top aide Huma Abedin has also avoided any real scrutiny by the media and has been defended by both Democrats and establishment Republicans, including  Sen. John McCain and Sen. Marco Rubio.But Breitbart News has kept on the story of Huma Abedin. Here is some of the exhaustive reporting Breitbart has done on Huma Abedin:Media coverage of this story has been supporessed owing to pressure from the Democratic Party.For example, Vanity Fair magazine published an article Jan. 6 of this year with the now eerily accurate title, ""Is Huma Abedin Hillary Clinton's Secret Weapon or Her Next Big Problem?"" The left-wing attack machine Media Matters for America wasted no time in posting an article with false information and smears in order to protect the Clinton campaign.Hillary Clinton has stated publicly that she helped ""start and support"" the Media Matters group, and that organization has consistently come to her rescue with misinformation, half-truths, and smears that invariably get repeated by the established media.The Vanity Fair article apparently sent shockwaves through the Clinton camp. Any mainstream press coverage of Huma Abedin is rare, and what coverage there is almost universally laudatory. Despite the fawning coverage she has received, there are many unanswered questions about Abedin, especially given Abedin's complete access to Hillary Clinton, one of the most powerful people in the world, a former Secretary of State and possible future president. As Vanity Fair's William Cohan writes in his piece:Over the years Huma has served in several positions, with increasingly important-sounding titles. She has been Hillary's ""body woman,"" her traveling chief of staff, a senior adviser, and a deputy chief of staff when Hillary was secretary of state. Now, based in Brooklyn, she is the vice-chair of Hillary's 2016 presidential campaign.The Vanity Fair piece on the secretive Abedin confirmed a number of facts that have been reported by conservative media for a couple of years but have been twisted and convoluted by the mainstream media.For example, the Vanity Fair article flatly lays out the information that Huma Abedin was an assistant editor at a publication called the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs from 1996 until 2008. He writes:When (Huma) Abedin was two years old, the family moved to Jidda, Saudi Arabia, where, with the backing of Abdullah Omar Nasseef, then the president of King Abdulaziz University, her father founded the Institute of Muslim Minority Affairs, a think tank, and became the first editor of its Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs, which stated its mission as ""shedding light"" on minority Muslim communities around the world in the hope of ""securing the legitimate rights of these communities.""...It turns out the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs is an Abedin family business. Huma was an assistant editor there between 1996 and 2008. Her brother, Hassan, 45, is a book-review editor at the Journal and was a fellow at the Oxford Center for Islamic Studies, where Nasseef is chairman of the board of trustees. Huma's sister, Heba, 26, is an assistant editor at the Journal.Breitbart News added information this year that shows that the ""Abedin family business"" is housed in the offices of the Muslim World League.The webpage for the Institute for Muslim Minority Affairs site says how to reach the Journal: ""Editorial Correspondence including submission of articles and books for review should be addressed to: Editor, Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs 46 Goodge Street, London WIP 1FJ, U.K.""The current official Journal website also lists the same 46 Goodge Street address, which is the same exact address listed on the Muslim World League's London office address.The official website for the Muslim World League's London office lists its address as 46 Goodge Street.The current day London Online website also lists the Muslim World League office in London and the Journal's parent organization, Institute of Muslim Minority Affairs, as having the exact same 46 Goodge Street address.A Yelp! listing for the Muslim World League shows the same 46 Goodge Address and a photo of the entrance.Google Maps from 2008--the earliest date available--shows the Muslim Word League London office entrance, which appears to have office space above a pizza restaurant.This direct connection to the Muslim World League and a child organization called the World Arab Muslim Youth Association (WAMY)--also housed at Goodge Street offices--is significant due to a 2009 State Department memo which reveals that while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State and Huma Abedin was her top aide, and the Secretary of State's office was engaged in talks with Saudi Arabia about stopping the Muslim World League from funding terrorism at the same time the ""Abedin family business"" was operating out of the Muslim World League's London office.This revelation shows that while Huma Abedin was serving at the highest level of government as Hillary Clinton's aide and had access to this information, Abedin had a direct connection to a group that was suspected of actively funding groups like al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and Hamas, which had not only killed civilians around the world but also U.S. servicemen.The memo, which was originally published by WikiLeaks, was sent on December 30, 2009 from the Secretary of State to the Department of Treasury and ambassadors in several Gulf region countries including Saudi Arabia. The stated goal of the memo is that ""all action posts deliver the general talking points"" to those countries.The connection to terror funding is also listed in the infamous ""missing 28 pages"" from a report by the 9/11 commission that were kept hidden for years until their release on a Friday afternoon earlier this year. Page 24 of the 28-page report discusses Osama Bin Laden's half-brother and says in part:According to the FBI, Abdullah Bin Ladin has a number of connections to terrorist organizations. He is the President and Director of the World Arab Muslim Youth Association (WAMY) and the Institute of Islamic and Arabic Science in America. Both organizations are local branches of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) based in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.According to the FBI, there is reason to believe that WAMY is ""closely associated with the funding and financing of international terrorist activities and in the past has provided logistical support to individuals wishing to to fight in the Afghan War."" In 1998, the CIA published a paper characterizing WAMY as a NGO that provides funding. logistical support and training with possible connections to the Arab Afghans network, Hamas, Algerian extremists and Philippine militants.Although the 28 pages make no mention of Abedin at all, the information in the 28 pages lays out a timeline of events during the planning and execution of the 9/11 terror attack that shows that, at all times, Huma Abedin was working for both Hillary Clinton and the WAMY organization the Institute for Muslim Minority Affairs.These connections become especially disturbing when you consider what Sperry reported yesterday:Another guard assigned to Clinton's residence in Chappaqua, N.Y., recalled in a February FBI interview that new security procedures for handling delivery of the diplomatic pouch and receiving via fax the highly classified Presidential Daily Brief (PDB) had been ""established by Abedin."" The witness added that Abedin controlled the operations of a secure room known as a SCIF located on the third floor of the residence.In her own April 2016 interview with the FBI, Abedin contended that she ""did not know that Clinton had a private server until about a year and a half ago, when it became public knowledge."" The clintonemail.com server was set up in the basement of the Chappaqua residence.However, another witness told agents that he and another Clinton aide with an IT background built the new server system ""at the recommendation of Huma Abedin,"" who first broached the idea of an off-the-grid email server as early as the ""fall (of) 2008,"" ostensibly after Barack Obama was elected president.With the FBI investigation reopened, it will be interesting to see if the mainstream media finally begins to do their job and ask tough questions about Huma Abedin.The New York Times reports that the F.B.I. obtained new Hillary Clinton emails after seizing electronic devices from Anthony Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin.
The F.B.I. began investigating Weiner after he sent lewd photos to a 15-year-old girl, after the girl  shared text messages she received from Weiner with the Daily Mail.Protective detail assigned to guard former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her two residences complained that her closest aide Huma Abedin often overrode standard security protocols during trips to the Middle East, and personally changed procedures for handling classified information, including highly sensitive intelligence briefs the CIA prepared for the president, newly released FBI documents reveal.

The Director owes it to the American people to immediately provide the full details of what he is now examining,"" Podesta said in a statement.However Podesta's words are a far cry from the Clinton campaign's previous praise for the FBI and its director James Comey, following the agency's announcement that it would not be pursuing the case against Clinton.""Throughout his long career in law enforcement, the independence of FBI chief James Comey has rarely been questioned. Comey is a well-respected Republican who served as George W. Bush's Deputy Attorney General. And when President Obama tapped him to serve as Director of the FBI, he was confirmed by a 93-1 vote,"" a statement on Hillary Clinton's official website read at the time, in a post rather ironically entitled ""GOP Follows Conspiracy-Theorist-in-Chief Donald Trump Into Another Taxpayer-Funded Sham Inquiry.""The Clinton Campaign then released another statement a week later, claiming that Comey had ""shut the door on any remaining conspiracy theories once and for all.""""The Director's explanations shut the door on any remaining conspiracy theories once and for all. While Republicans may try to keep this issue alive, this hearing proved those efforts will only backfire,"" the statement claimed.Democratic National Committee chair Donna Brazile also tweeted her belief that Republicans skeptical of the FBI's decision were ""damaging the rule of law"" in America.Wash.
