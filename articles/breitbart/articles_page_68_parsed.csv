Originally from India, Kumar was naturalized as a U.S. citizen last year and plans to cast his first-ever vote for Trump as a ""role model for all American people.""Regarding the sexual assault allegations against Trump -- including a first-person account in People magazine -- Kumar blamed the ""dishonest media"" for the ""distraction.""California will almost certainly go to Clinton on Nov. 8, but the state is a lucrative cash draw for both candidates as they raise money for their campaigns.Joel B.

He said he will then report back to an Arab ministerial committee which will decide on next steps.Mansour announced the new Palestinian initiatives ahead of an informal meeting of the U.N. Security Council Friday on ""Illegal Israeli Settlements: Obstacles to Peace and the Two-State Solution."" It was organized by five non-permanent council members -- Angola, Malaysia, Venezuela, Senegal and Egypt.The scheduled speakers include representatives from two Israeli human rights groups, Peace Now and B'Tselem, and Americans for Peace Now.Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon harshly criticized the expected participation of the Israeli organizations.""During this time of year of reflection and prayer for unity amongst our people, it is sad and disappointing that Israeli organizations are providing moral cover for anti-Israel activities at the U.N.,"" Danon said.Mansour strongly criticized the ""dangerous evolution of settlement activities which is threatening to destroy the two-state solution option.""The Palestinians pushed for the Security Council to adopt a resolution against settlements in February 2011 but it was vetoed by the United States. The 14 other Security Council members voted in favor of the resolution, reflecting the wide support for the draft which had over 100 co-sponsors.Mansour said a new resolution would draw from the 2011 text which would have condemned ""illegal"" Israeli settlements and demanded an immediate halt to all settlement building.Mansour said he hasn't met U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power yet.""From what has been coming out from Washington, State Department, White House, and what has been written in the media ... there is a strong indication that the United States of America should be sympathetic to a resolution on settlements,"" Mansour said, ""although we don't know for sure because they did not tell us exactly what they will do.""As for the possibility of Palestine becoming the 194th U.N. member state, the Security Council's admissions committee approved a report in November 2011 saying there was no consensus among the 15 council nations on the Palestinian application for U.N. membership. That application is still before the council.Mansour said the Palestinians, whose status at the U.N. has been upgraded from an observer to an observer state, have support from ""more than nine"" countries on the council for a new membership bid.But the U.S. would almost certainly veto a membership resolution if there is no Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement -- and at the moment there is not even a prospect of reviving peace talks.SIGN UP"	[]	[]

New York) has described it as an organization ""which we know has ties to terrorism,"" while Senator Dick Durbin (D. Illinois) has said that CAIR is ""unusual in its extreme rhetoric and its associations with groups that are suspect.""Moreover, Steven Pomerantz, former counterterrorism chief for the FBI, has noted that ""CAIR, its leaders, and its activities effectively give aid to international terrorist groups.""Earlier this year, CAIR called on Muslims to openly defy U.S. Customs Agents when questioned on travel from Islamic controlled countries, urging them to reply, ""None of your Damn Business.""Although CAIR did not reveal the formulation of the questions asked in its voter survey or what list of Muslim voters it used for the 800 ""independent live telephone"" calls that composed its study, it did report that the calls were made ""after the first presidential debate"" and asked about Muslim turnout at the polls, whom they plan to vote for in the election and what issues they believe are important in determining who to vote for.During the second debate, Donald Trump said that Hillary Clinton was afraid to use the expression ""radical Islamic terrorism"" in describing America's security issue, while Hillary Clinton eschewed the term ""Islamic,"" referring instead to ""violent jihadist terrorists.""Commenting on the debate, CAIR Government Affairs Director Robert McCaw criticized both expressions, insisting that the Islamic State has nothing to do with Islam.""There is no jihad that the Islamic State could commit that would be in the name of Islam,"" McCaw said. ""I would never apply this term to the criminal state ISIS.""According to CAIR, its survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percent.Follow Thomas D.

There's no other option,"" Assad said in an interview with Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda.""Aleppo is going to be a very important springboard to do this move,"" added Assad.As the air strikes and shelling of the city's east intensified after a brief period of relative calm, Syria's government approved a United Nations plan to allow aid convoys into the most besieged areas of Syria, with the exception of Aleppo.Syria's civil war, now in its sixth year, has killed 300,000 people and left millions homeless while dragging in regional and global powers as well as inspiring jihadist attacks abroad.Assad is backed by the Russian air force, Iran's Revolutionary Guards and an array of Shi'ite militias from Arab neighbors, while Sunni rebels seeking to oust him are backed by Turkey, the United States and Gulf monarchies.Assad also told the newspaper that the country's civil war had become a conflict between Russia and the West.""What we've been seeing recently during the last few weeks, and maybe few months, is something like more than Cold War,"" Assad said. ""I don't know what to call it, but it's not something that has existed recently, because I don't think that the West and especially the United States has stopped their Cold War, even after the collapse of the Soviet Union.""Assad added that Turkey's actions in Syria constituted an ""invasion, against international law, against the morals, against the sovereignty of Syria.""'MAY AMOUNT TO WAR CRIMES'As air strikes killed 13 people on Thursday in the rebel-held Aleppo districts of al-Kalaseh, Bustan al-Qasr and al-Sakhour, according to a civil defense official, European Union foreign ministers drafted a statement accusing Syria and its allies of violence that ""may amount to war crimes.""""Since the beginning of the offensive by the (Syrian) regime and its allies, the intensity and scale of aerial bombardment of eastern Aleppo is clearly disproportionate,"" a draft of their statement seen by Reuters said.Syrian and Russian governments say they target only militants.To the south, hundreds of insurgents and their families have left two rebel-held towns on the northern outskirts of Damascus, residents and fighters said, under a deal with the government which is pushing its opponents to rebel areas further from the capital.The evacuation happened after the army gave community leaders in Qudsiya and Al-Hama - which had enjoyed relative calm under local truces - an ultimatum to get several hundred fighters out of their towns or face a wide-scale assault.""They gave us little option: Leave or all hell breaks loose,"" said Yousef al Hasnawi, a resident on the local rebel council.The Damascus government says such amnesties are a ""workable model to bring security and peace,"" but its opponents say forcing Sunni Muslim fighters and their families from their hometowns could create new demographic frontiers and worsen sectarian tensions.OBAMA TO REVIEW OPTIONSU.S. President Barack Obama and his senior foreign policy advisers are expected to meet on Friday to consider military and other options in Syria, U.S. officials told Reuters.Some officials argue the United States must act more forcefully in Syria or risk losing what influence it still has over moderate rebels and its Arab, Kurdish and Turkish allies in the fight against Islamic State.U.S. officials said they considered it unlikely that Obama would order U.S. air strikes on Syrian government targets, and stressed that he may not make any decisions at the planned meeting of his National Security Council.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov are due to meet in Switzerland on Saturday to resume their effort to find a diplomatic solution along with counterparts from some Middle Eastern countries.Moscow called on Thursday on states in the region not to supply portable anti-aircraft missiles to Syrian rebel groups, warning that any unfriendly actions against Russian forces would draw an appropriate response.'IT'S GOING ON NOW'Air strikes against rebel-held areas of eastern Aleppo had tapered off over the weekend after the Syrian army announced it would reduce raids for what it described as humanitarian reasons, but they have intensified since Tuesday.""The bombing started at 2 a.m. and it's going on until now,"" Ibrahim Abu Laith, an official at the civil defense rescue organization in Aleppo, told Reuters from the city.Rescue workers said 154 people had been killed in recent days. Reuters could not independently verify the death toll.Aleppo has been divided between government- and rebel-controlled areas for years. More than 250,000 people are believed to be trapped in eastern Aleppo - the anti-Assad rebels' most important urban stronghold - facing shortages of food, fuel and medicine.In Geneva, the United Nations said Damascus had partially approved its aid plan for October, giving the green light for convoys to 25 of 29 besieged and hard-to-reach areas across Syria, which are also deprived of some vital supplies.But the Syrian government did not give approval for either eastern Aleppo or three districts near Damascus, Ramzy Ezzeldin Ramzy, the United Nations' deputy special envoy to Syria, said on Thursday, describing the situation as ""dire.""In a government-held area of western Aleppo, at least four children were killed and 10 wounded on Thursday when shells landed near a school, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.Syrian state news agency SANA said the school in the al-Suleimaniya area had been targeted in what it described as a terrorist attack.SIGN UP"	['Obama']	[]

The first one, Kunduz city, fell twice, but it is allegedly once again under the control of the Afghans.WSJ adds that Afghan security forces are being stretched thin as they respond to Taliban attacks in provincial capitals across the country.According to the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), a U.S. watchdog agency appointed by Congress, the U.S.-backed Afghan troops, who are in the lead of security operations despite facing capability gaps, are being sent into battle with some ""ghost"" troops, a move that limits the number of actual troops on the ground therefore endangering the lives of Afghan and American service members doing the actual fighting.""Neither the United States nor our Afghan allies truly know how many Afghan soldiers and police are available for duty, or, by extension, the true nature of their operational capability,"" SIGARtold lawmakers in April 2015.SIGAR estimated that of the 319,595 troops who are supposed to be in the ANDSF, nearly 200,000 are ""ghost"" forces whose salaries are being collected by corrupt officials.In Helmand alone, Aqa Noor Kintoz, the provincial police chief, said in June that up to half of the tens of thousands of the ANDSF troops who had been deployed to his province at the time were ""ghost.""His predecessor was accused of ""exploiting his official powers, establishing ghost police and underestimating his responsibilities in the war with insurgents,"" reported TOLO News.There is no longer mention of tens of thousands of troops in Helmand in recent news articles.Helmand is one of the deadliest regions of the ongoing war for U.S.-led coalition and Afghan forces.  As the largest and top opium producing province, it is an important source of funding for the Taliban, estimated to generate billions.It is also located in southern Afghanistan along the Pakistan border, making it easier for Taliban jihadists to escape into sanctuaries allegedly sanctioned by Islamabad.Reuters reports:Afghan officials say security forces are losing as many as 5,000 people each month through casualties and desertion, while only about 3,000 new soldiers and police are recruited over the same period.Helmand is also close to fallen back into the hands of the Taliban.Taliban jihadists, which have a close relationship with al Qaeda and the Haqqani Network, controlled nearly 40 percent of Helmand's 13 districts as of March, including parts of the capital, The New York Times (NYT) learned from the Afghan security forces.In July, SIGAR determined that the the Afghan security forces were struggling ""to respond to the Taliban's growing national presence.""By August, nearly five months after the NYT report, the Taliban was launching attacks ""on several fronts"" in Helmand and had seized control of ""around 80 percent of the province,"" doubling their control of the province, Kareem Atal, chief of Helmand's provincial council, told The Associated Press (AP).Despite investing nearly $70 billion in U.S. taxpayer funds on the ANDSF, the forces are still unable to ""properly"" engage the Taliban on the battlefield, noted SIGAR at the of July.""There are a number of districts that the government claims are under their control, but the government is only present in the district administrative center and all around are under the control of the insurgents,"" said Atal, echoing a recent assessment by the U.S. Forces-Afghanistan (USFOR-A) of the situation across the country.At the end of July, USFOR-A suggested that nearly one-third of Afghanistan is either under insurgent control or influence, primarily the Taliban, or at risk of being so.In response to the chaos in Helmand, President Barack Obama deployed nearly 100 American troops in late August to the provincial capital of Lashkar Gah, said Brig. Gen. Charles Cleveland, spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan.Afghan officials say security forces are losing as many as 5,000 people each month through casualties and desertion, while only about 3,000 new soldiers and police are recruited over the same period.SIGN UP"	['Obama']	[]

The Pope told the group, on ecumenical pilgrimage to Rome, that a person cannot be a Christian without living as a Christian.""It is a hypocritical call oneself a Christian and send away a refugee, or one who needs my help. Jesus taught us who the good Christian is in the parable of the good Samaritan,"" he said.The Pope also underscored what he termed the ""contradiction in those who want to defend Christianity in the West and on the other hand are against other religions and against refugees,"" he said, in evident reference to Muslim migrants.""This is not something in a books, it is a something in the news every day,"" he said.When asked about the Protestant Reformation, Francis said that medieval theologians taught that the Church is always in need of reform. ""This is progress,"" he said.""The greatest reformers of the Church are saints: men and women who follow and practice the word of the Lord and have their soul filled with the gospel,"" he said.The Pope announced that later this month he intends to visit Lund, Sweden, and ""together with the Lutheran World Federation we will commemorate, after five centuries the beginning of Luther's reform and thank the Lord for fifty years of official dialogue between Lutherans and Catholics.""The Pope's words this morning coincided with the release of his message for the 2017 World Day of Migrants and Refugees, where he reflected primarily on the plight of child migrants.Follow Thomas D.

[A] few months ago when you were asked, what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia ... And the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years.""SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERToday, Obama's first Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, sees Russian conspiracies everywhere, all leading to Donald J. Trump.Welcome back to the McCarthy era.It is now an article of faith in the Democratic Party that: 1) Russian President Vladimir Putin wants Donald Trump to win the U.S. election; 2) Email hacks of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Clinton campaign chair John Podesta help Donald Trump; 3) Russia can be held responsible for the hacking -- rightly or wrongly; 4) Trump called upon Russia to hack Clinton's email (actually, he just joked about it); 5) Trump is responsible for Wikileaks, and perhaps guilty of treason as well.The Russian conspiracy theory, for Democrats, obscures whatever the leaked emails contain -- be they Hillary Clinton's closely-guarded Wall Street speeches, which Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) sought and failed to uncover; or be they a question passed by CNN contributor (now DNC chair) Donna Brazile to the Clinton campaign to give her an advantage in a town hall debate with Sanders in March.Brazile's version of the conspiracy theory was evasive yet concise: ""Our intelligence community has made it clear that the Russian government is responsible for the cyberattacks aimed at interfering with our election, and that WikiLeaks is part of that effort. This revelation should deeply trouble all Americans in both parties. And yet, Donald Trump continues to deny that Russia is behind these attempts to meddle with our electoral process and cheer on these efforts to undermine our democracy.""The excuse is always the same: You cannot trust the emails, because of Russia, and Trump.It is entirely plausible that Russia is, in fact, hacking the Democrats -- perhaps for fun, and perhaps for profit. Though it is a mystery why Putin would prefer Trump to Clinton, because Russia used Clinton to achieve everything it wanted in foreign affairs.Thanks to Clinton's Russian ""reset,"" Russia reversed American plans for missile defense in Europe; set the stage for the invasion and annexation of the Crimea; and expanded nuclear cooperation with Iran, which still wants nuclear weapons.Lately, Russia has begun to replace the U.S. as the pre-eminent outside power in the Middle East. That is largely the fault of Clinton's successor, the hapless John Kerry, who bumbled his way into a phony chemical weapons agreement that effectively accepted the Assad dictatorship as a permanent fixture.But Hillary Clinton did nothing on Syria -- despite self-serving claims in her memoir, Hard Choices. The ""hard choice"" would have been to resign rather than accept genocide, and she declined it.The Washington Post tried to make excuses for Hillary Clinton's ""reset"" policy, as it gave her its endorsement. ""When Ms. Clinton launched the policy, Dmitry Medvedev, not Vladimir Putin, was president of Russia, and nobody -- maybe not even Mr. Putin -- knew how things would play out."" Rubbish -- everyone knew. As Clinton's own running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) said in the vice presidential debate, you would have to be ignorant of Russian history to trust Vladimir Putin -- at all.The Post also claimed: ""As Mr. Putin reasserted himself and Russia became more hostile, Ms. Clinton was clear-eyed about the need to adjust U.S. policy."" Really? Did she speak up in 2012 when President Obama leaned across to Medvedev over a hot mic and said those infamous words, meant to be conveyed to Putin: ""This is my last election. After my election, I have more flexibility."" That was near the end of Clinton's term, when she was supposedly wiser. Yet she said nothing in protest.Of interest: the fact that the Obama administration chose to blame Russia, publicly, for the hacking. That accusation was very convenient for the Clinton campaign, which now cites it at every opportunity. But the accusation makes no sense, if national interest is considered. If the accusation is false, then the White House has alienated Russia for no reason. And if it is true, the administration has just advertised the weakness of our cyber-defenses. Politics, as always for Obama and Clinton, came first.The Clinton campaign likes to argue that Trump is friendly to Russia because of his own business interests. But as Clinton Cash revealed, and as Wikileaks has now confirmed, the Clintons and their entourage -- including Podesta -- courted Russian business and patronage. Clinton allowed the State Department to approve the infamous Uranium One deal, which placed 20% of U.S. uranium resources in the hands of a Russian firm controlled by Putin -- greased by a Clinton Foundation donation.It is horrific to watch Russia march across land frontiers in Europe as if international law simply did not exist, and to watc assist the Assad regime's mass murder. And yet the grim reality, which only Trump seems to grasp, is that Russia is also a strategic partner against Islamic terror (which Clinton refuses even to call by its proper name). Russia's other interest is in creating chaos in the international system. So we are, at best, ""frenemies"" -- but not friends one election, enemies the next.Democrats like to accuse Trump of xenophobia, but their Russian hysteria is actually worse, echoing their absurd pretense in the 2010 midterms that foreign donors were using the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to influence our elections -- even as real-life foreign donors were lining up at the Clinton Foundation to bribe their way into Hillary's good graces and largesse.The Clinton campaign's Russia conspiracy theory is little more than the Clintons' latest, last, desperate attempt to hide the truth.Joel B.

Our lawsuit is therefore against the federal government.  We knock out the immunity, and then we can sue Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.In response, the Justice Department simply tried to dodge the issue, saying we were suing the wrong entity. Our lawyers are preparing a full-throated response, but meanwhile, the left is crowing: this little hit piece about our case is filled with hyperbole and nonsense. The government filed a very predictable motion that, unsurprisingly, raises two issues: our standing to sue and state action. To have standing to sue, one must show an injury in fact that is fairly traceable to the action one is challenging, and that can be redressed by the court. The government concedes in its motion that we have shown that.However, the government is arguing that the injury is from the social media giants and thus not fairly traceable to them, and therefore the injury is also not redressable by the court. But ""fairly traceable"" does not require a direct injury from the entity one is suing. If the action we are challenging materially increased the probability of injury, we have met that standard. And we clearly have: as everyone knows, the only reason why social media can discriminate against us the way they do is because of the immunity granted by the federal government.The second argument that the Justice Department makes in its response to us is related in many ways to the first. The DoJ argues that there is no constitutional violation because the harm caused (the censorship) was by a private actor (social media). That is generally true, but the Supreme Court has declared that the government is responsible when it enacts laws that change the legal relationship between two groups, including the selective withdrawal from one group of legal protections against private acts, regardless of whether the private acts can be attributed to the government -- and that is precisely the situation here.The challenged congressional statute--which, by definition, is an Act of ""Congress"" - alters the legal relations between us as Plaintiffs on the one hand and Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube on the other, such that these media giants are permitted to censor, with impunity, our speech based on its content and viewpoint. Consequently, state action lies in the enactment of this federal statute, regardless of whether the private acts are attributable to the government. And the resulting injury is ""fairly traceable"" to the challenged statute and ""redressable"" by the relief requested. In sum, the government's motion should be denied.Our response to the government challenge notes:Through the use of Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube, anyone person with access to the Internet can become a town crier with a voice that resonates farther than it could from any soapbox, and the same individual can become a pamphleteer. In sum, the Internet, particularly through social media, has become the new marketplace of ideas.Today, the impact of the Internet as a medium of worldwide human communication cannot be overstated. Social media, particularly including Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, are exceedingly important for worldwide human communication and thus provide important forums for that communication. Denying a person or organization access to these important social media forums based on the content and viewpoint of the person's or organization's speech on matters of public concern, as in this case, is an effective way of silencing or censoring speech and depriving the person or organization of political influence and business opportunities.Businesses that provide Internet services in California, such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, are subject to SS 51 of the California Civil Code, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of political affiliation, religious affiliation, or political or religious beliefs, including speech expressing those beliefs. Facebook's, Twitter's, and YouTube's discrimination against Plaintiffs as set forth in the Complaint violates SS 51 of the California Civil Code, but for SS 230 of the CDA.By way of Section 230, the government is empowering this type of discrimination and censorship. By its own terms, this statute permits Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube ""to restrict access to or availability of material that [they] consider to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable."" But this statute does not provide any kind of objective standard for determining which speech is ""objectionable.""Consequently, Section 230, according to our response:Can we guarantee that the judge will agree with us? No plaintiff can ever do that, and certainly not in the types of cases we bring. If the district court judge dismisses our case, will we pursue this further, including possibly to the Supreme Court? Yes. This issue is too important. With this power of censorship, social media could seriously influence this presidential campaign, and indeed, is already doing so.For years I have documented the outrageous bias of Facebook's speech policies. Notoriously one-sided, those who oppose jihad terror, support Israel and stand against the most brutal and extreme ideology on the face of the earth (sharia) have been systematically blocked and banned. Just last June, Facebook took down my page and blocked me after a devout Muslim opened fire on a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Facebook said they took down my page because of their rule against ""hateful, obscene, or threatening"" content.But it is not hateful, obscene, or threatening to oppose jihad terror such as we saw in Orlando and in so many other places. Truth is not hateful or obscene. What is hateful, obscene and threatening is that Facebook is moving to silence everyone who speaks honestly about the motivating ideology behind such attacks. To get at Facebook and the other social media giants, we have to challenge the government statute first.The left needs to handicap and shut down the opposition, because its positions do not stand up to refutation and cogent analysis. That's why the ""liberals"" are working hard to shut down free speech. Liberal, indeed. But we will continue to fight them every step of the way.Pamela Geller Lawsuit Document by Breitbart News on ScribdPamela Geller is the President of the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI), publisher of PamelaGeller.com and author of The Post-American Presidency: The Obama Administration's War on America and Stop the Islamization of America: A Practical Guide to the Resistance.

Trump after both the release of a lewd tape featuring Trump and his debate Sunday with Democratic rival Hillary R. Clinton, according to two polls conducted by the We the People Convention Oct. 8 and Oct. 11 with likely Ohio voters.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROctober 11 Poll Results by Breitbart News on ScribdOhio voters in the first poll of 1,539 likely voters supported Trump with 46 percent of the electorate compared with 40 percent for Clinton, said Tom Zawistowski, the executive director of We the People Convention. The Oct. 8 poll carries a 2.46 percent margin of error with a 95 percent level of confidence.Libertarian Gary Johnson was the choice of four percent of the voters and the Green Party nominee Dr. Jill Stein was the choice of one percent, the radio host of TEA Party Talk with Tom Z. said.The Oct. 8 poll was not planned to capture the reaction to the tape controversy; rather it was meant to be part of a before-and-after for the debate, he said.October8PollResults.pages (1) by Breitbart News on ScribdThe respondents were asked: When you talk to people in your community about the presidential election, who do most of them say they are going to vote for? Forty-nine percent said Trump, 32 percent said Clinton.Ninety-one percent of the respondents said they were aware of the lewd tape and 76 percent said they planned to watch the presidential debate.In the Oct. 11 poll, Zawistowski said We the People went back to the original sample population and 473 voters responded.The second poll, taken the day after the debate, showed 50 percent supported Trump and 39 percent supported the former first lady. The second poll carries a 3.75 percent margin of error with a 95 percent level of confidence.Johnson and Stein did not participate in the debate, and the Libertarian's support fell to three percent, while no respondents chose Stein, which is a reflection of the small sample population in the second poll.Zawistowski said the poll shows that before the debate Trump had a six percentage point lead in the aftermath of the lewd tape's release, but three days later and after the debate Trump has a 12 percentage point lead.Respondents were asked in the Oct. 11 poll: Since the debate Sunday, over the past two days, when you talk to people in your community about the presidential election, who do most of them say will vote for now?  Trump was the answer from 46 percent and Clinton was the choice of 36 percent.The polls were conducted from a list of 45,105 registered voters in Ohio, randomly selected from a list of 4.5 million current land lines in the state. In the Oct. 8 poll, 1,539 participated, for a response rate of 3.4 percent. In the Oct. 11, poll, only the 1,539 were contacted and 473 responded, for a 30.7 percent response rate.SIGN UP	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

Their financial resources are virtually unlimited, their political resources are unlimited, their media resources are unmatched, and most importantly, the depths of their immorality is absolutely unlimited.Trump highlighted the now well-documented collusion between the global special interests, corporate media, and Hillary Clinton who champions policies to cede ""U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends. and her donors."" Trump slammed, what he described as, our ""illusion of democracy""- explaining how our political process is controlled ""by a small handful of global special interests rigging the system.""Trump explained that the ""Clinton machine,"" working through its arm in the corporate media, has declared ""war"" not just against him, but against the American people, who want to reclaim their government to represent their needs and interests, rather than simply representing the desires of corporate donors and transnational elites. Trump said:Let's be clear on one thing. The corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism. They're a political special interest no different than any lobbyist or other financial entity with a total political agenda, and the agenda is not for you, it's for themselves.And their agenda is to elect crooked Hillary Clinton at any cost, at any price, no matter how many lives they destroy.

He has told his version of events to police, who say they have reason to believe his co-pilot, 28-year-old Feras M. Freitekh, meant to crash the plane.Prevalla and Freitekh were flying a Piper PA-34 Seneca twin-engine plane as part of Freitekh's aviation education on Tuesday when the plane crashed onto East Hartford's Main Street. Prevalla has told law enforcement officials that Freitekh began to argue with him over control of the plane, and before he could wrest the plane from his hands, it had crashed. According to The New York Times:Mr. Freitekh was coming in for a landing when he told the instructor that ""something's a little off here,"" a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation said. Mr. Prevalla, according to the official, ""says, 'Let me take over.' And the kid comes in for a second time for a landing, or he doesn't let him take over.""Mr. Prevalla was becoming increasingly anxious, and as they made a second approach, he told Mr. Freitekh, ""I'm taking over,"" according to the official.But apparently before the instructor could get control, Mr. Freitekh sent the plane into a nose-dive onto Main Street.""Nothing's off the table,"" East Hartford police Lt. Josh Litwin told reporters on Wednesday, including terrorism, as the crash has been deemed an ""intentional"" one. Officials note, however, that Freitekh ""was not on any terrorism watch list"" and that no evidence at his residence has led officials to believe he was tied to international terrorist groups. Police have yet to investigate the content on his electronic devices.Freitekh's Facebook page, under the name ""Rafael Majdi Feritekh,"" does not appear to indicate that Freitekh publicly displayed any sympathy for Islamic or jihadist groups. It does appear to show a passion for flying aircraft, with his profile picture being an image of him kissing the nose of a plane.Abdul-Rahman Freitekh, a cousin living in Jordan, told The New York Times that Freitekh ""did not pray"" and ""religion was not an issue.""""Unfortunately, this looks, at this point, like an individual who wanted to end his life and used this event to do it,"" an unnamed law enforcement official told The Hartford Courant.Mr. Freitekh was coming in for a landing when he told the instructor that ""something's a little off here,"" a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation said.

Trump's presidential campaign is firing back hard at Democratic rival Hillary Rodham Clinton after revelations in WikiLeaks-published emails from her campaign staff prove she truly does support the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP).SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""Today's email release reveals what we already knew, that Hillary Clinton supports TPP and TPA and she lied about it to the American people at the debate,"" Jason Miller, Trump's senior communications adviser, said in a statement. ""She is without a doubt opposed to America First trade policies. Clinton's so-called opposition to TPP will fade away should she become President and she will sell us out to global special interests.""The emails, hacked from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and published by WikiLeaks in the latest tranche of emails, prove that Clinton's campaign originally assumed she would support both fast track Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) and the TPP. Then, when it became controversial, the emails show the political staffers around Hillary Clinton concocted a scheme to help her flip-flop her position to against it--not because she would be truly against it but for political purposes in order to get votes from union members.In fact, in one such email, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook admitted it would not be ""comfortable"" for Clinton to oppose something she had supported throughout her time as Secretary of State.Not only did she support it in her book--and publicly at least 45 other times according to CNN--but according to Bloomberg she actually had ""taken a leading part in drafting"" the TPP as Secretary of State.SIGN UP"	['Clinton']	[]
