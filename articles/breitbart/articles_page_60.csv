Our public schools had been the envy of the world, but the world caught up. And we started getting outpaced when it came to math and science education. And African American and Latino students, in part because of the legacy of discrimination, too often lagged behind our white classmates - something called the achievement gap that, by one estimate, costs us hundreds of billions of dollars a year. And we were behind other developed countries when it came to the number of young people who were getting a higher education. So I said, when I first came into office, by 2020 I want us to be number one again. I want us to be number one across the board.The president, who appeared with both current U.S. Secretary of Education John King and the former secretary, Arne Duncan, told students, ""We live in a global economy,"" and that they will be competing for jobs with people not only from the United States, but also from ""India and China.""Obama told students about the ""real changes"" he has made in education, noting that the federal government now intervenes in the education of ""young people, from the time they're born all the way through until they got a career.""""And the good news is that we've made real progress,"" he said, touting the expansion of the Head Start program and funding for a new federal pre-school program - which was provided in the massive new education bill called the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). In the spirit of ""bipartisanship,"" Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) and Rep. John Kline (R-MN) urged Republicans in Congress to support the bill and most complied.""High-quality early education is one of the best investments we can make, which is why we've added over 60,000 children to Head Start,"" Obama boasted. ""We called for high-quality preschool for every four-year-old in America.""Obama also touted his Race to the Top (RttT) ""competition,"" which served as the incentive program for states to adopt the Common Core State standards - the highly controversial and unpopular education reform also intended as a social justice program to close the achievement gap between low-income and middle class students. The president said RttT - which was included in his stimulus bill in 2009 - ""inspired states to set higher, better standards so that we could out-teach and out-compete other nations.""Obama continued that he worked with ""private and philanthropic partners"" to bring up-to-date technology to high schools as well as ""personalized"" learning for students - which is heavily reliant on massive personal student data collection.The president also added, ""we're investing more in getting girls and young women and young people of color and low-income students into science and engineering and technology and math.""Obama praised teachers who ""stay up late grading your assignments,"" yet still ""aren't paid as much as they should be.""""They're not doing it for the glory,"" he said. ""They're doing it because they love you, and they believe in you, and they want to help you succeed.""The president added:By 2020, two out of three job openings require some form of higher education. Now, that doesn't always mean a four-year college degree, but it does mean - whether it's a four-year university, or a community college, or some sort of training program - you've got to get a little bit more than just what you're getting in high school.Obama explained that much factory and office work - which he labeled ""repetitive work"" and said once required only a high school education - ""now is done by machines.""""So in order for you to succeed in the marketplace, you've got to be able to think creatively; you've got to be able to work with a team; you've got to be able to work with a machine and figure out how to make it tailored for the specific requirements of your business and your job,"" he said. ""All those things require some more sophisticated thinking than just sitting there and just doing the same thing over and over again. And that's why you've got to have more than just a high school education.""However, the president assured students that he has made it easier for them to access ""free money for college.""""Fill out your FAFSA, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid,"" he urged the students.Obama told students that he has also ""reformed the student loan system"" and now plans to make community college ""free"" for all students.He said:When I came into office, you had tens of billions of dollars that were going to big banks, serving as middlemen for your student loans. We said, well, let's cut out the banks. Let's give the money directly to the students so they can afford college and we can make the loans cheaper, and we can expand Pell grants.And now, what we're trying to do is to push to make two years of community college free for every responsible student all across the country. All across the country.""I am really proud of what we've accomplished,"" Obama said.However, consistent with Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton's attacks on state governments in an effort to make federal control of education more appealing, Obama added:There are still too many states that are cutting back on public education. And part of the reason tuition is going up is because states aren't putting as much money into state education, universities, community colleges as they used to. That's why, if you're 18, by the way, you've got to vote to make sure that the folks who represent you actually deliver.""For too many students in America, zip code still determines how far they'll go,"" Obama continued. ""And that's not acceptable.""The president blamed a lack of success for some students from low-income, minority communities on ""just the luck of the draw.""The president said his program, called My Brother's Keeper, is intended to ""help more young people, especially kids of color, get mentorships and the resources and the guidance they need to succeed."" Obama promised to remain involved in the initiative after he leaves office. [W]hen I took office almost eight years ago, we knew that our education system was falling short when it came to preparing young people like you for that reality.

Common causes for political lobbying include immigration rules, internet and privacy law, as well as rules about driverless cars.Further evidence of the closeness between government and the tech industry is the rising number of employees who are moving between the two sectors. In 2015, 183 people who worked for the Obama administration were hired by Google, whilst 58 went in the opposite direction. This is compared to just 4 people who moved between the government and tech sectors in 2006.Observers also point to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg sharing a stage with Barack Obama in June this year, as well as the ever more apparent left-leaning bias in Silicon Valley.Facebook employees were found to have donated to Hillary Clinton more than any other candidate in the current election cycle, whilst Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz donated $20 million to the Clinton campaign and left-wing organizations.It was also revealed this week through the latest WikiLeaks data dump that Apple CEO Tim Cook and Microsoft founder Bill Gates were on Hillary Clinton's list of potential Democratic vice-presidential nominees.You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com SIGN UP

The woman said they first thought one of their adult children was making a surprise visit, then the door to the bedroom opened and the suspect was standing in the doorway. The man grabbed a gun, pointed it at the suspect, and held him at gunpoint while the woman dialed 911.The woman retrieved another gun in the process, holding it on the suspect from a different angle. The incident occurred Sunday morning.Police identified the suspect as 38-year-old DeJuan McCraney. He ""was convicted in 2001 of attempted aggravated murder and released from prison in 2010."" Police say McCraney was not armed when he stepped into the couple's bedroom doorway, but they did discover a 9mm pistol they believe he laid on the couch before walking toward the bedroom. He now ""faces charges of aggravated burglary and having weapons illegally.""The woman of the house spoke out in support of the Second Amendment once the incident was over, saying:This is why gun control is a bad idea. We held him at bay until police arrived about 10 after 7. Did anyone die? No. Could anyone have died? Most certainly. Our guns saved our lives today.

There is an app with it that allows your phone's camera to see into and behind retinas and actually look through the eyes at the human brain.These technologies being used in Africa, where doctors say 80 percent of the people who are blind there could be cured with proper diagnosis, technology and care.Elsewhere, another such app, called Opternative, provides a 25-minute ""appointment"" with your computer and smartphone, then delivers results from board-certified ophthalmologists that have proven as accurate as traditional exams. An outfit from Israel developed what it calls 6on6, which lets users figure out their eye prescriptions through the manipulation of light on the eye.Other countries increasingly are moving away from requiring optometrists to examine patients and issue prescriptions before patients are allowed to acquire eye glasses or contact lenses. Japan and much of Europe already have discarded the prescription requirement, and others are considering it.But in the United States, powerful special interests are trying to take things in the other direction. A coalition of optometrists and contact lenses manufacturers are pushing Congress to adopt legislation that would strengthen the control medical professionals have over prescriptions for glasses and, especially, contact lenses.They want to undo a law passed in 2004 that gave patients much more freedom over where and how to acquire their contact lenses. Before 2004, eye doctors did not have to provide prescriptions to patients, and many did not. They simply ordered the contact lenses their patients required, which meant more profits for the doctors for acting as middlemen and more profits for the lens makers, who could charge more to what amounted to a captive market.The 2004 law required doctors to give patients prescriptions they could take anywhere to fill. It also said doctors must confirm or challenge prescriptions within eight working hours or the prescriptions would be assumed valid ... to prevent doctors from holding onto their monopolies by simply refusing to acknowledge their own prescriptions.This led firms, such as 1-800-CONTACTS, Walmart and others, to enter the market, and today, 43 million Americans wear contact lenses, and the industry has grown to $7 billion in annual sales.Powerful contact lens makers and the American Optometric Association have teamed up to back the Contact Lens Customer Health Protection Act, which would again let doctors slow-roll prescriptions if customers decide to purchase lenses elsewhere as long as they wished on the theory customers will get tired of living like Mr. Magoo and come crawling back.It also contains a forward-looking provision that would require sellers of contact lenses to provide fax and landline numbers to field doctors' questions. Online retailers do not use faxes or landlines in most cases, but rather, they respond by email.This is another technique doctors use to retain control over this lucrative side business that no other medical field has available - gumming up the works with questions that must be answered before prescriptions can be filled.Eye care people and lens makers argue the new rules have led to increased eye infections among patients and other quality-related problems, but voluminous research shows this not to be the case and that no increase in infections has occurred since contacts became widely available online.More tellingly, the contact lens firms so concerned about the health of Americans' eyes if they are allowed to order their own contact lenses or, heaven forbid, diagnose themselves, still somehow bring themselves to sell lenses in Japan, Europe and elsewhere where prescriptions are not required.Besides, as economist Veronique de Rugy points out, if the health of eye patients is the top concern, doctors should push for the widest variety of purchasing options.""The best actual guarantee of consumer health is the widespread availability of affordable lenses,"" de Rugy wrote. ""The cheaper and more convenient it is for consumers to purchase contacts, the easier it is for them to adhere to guidelines and wear only fresh, clean lenses. The market competition thus also improves customer health.""It's not hard to follow the action here. Eye health professionals had a highly profitable side business selling contacts to a captive audience. The 2004 legislation opened up that business to competition, and today, more customers than ever are enjoying lower prices, more choice and better service.The answer is not to subject consumers to higher prices and lower availability. It's to get in and compete. The doctors still have some advantages - convenience first among them. If they can't find a way to cooperate, they may find the U.S. becoming more amenable to the rules in place elsewhere, which would mean even less profits for them.SIGN UP"

"FOIA requests involving Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and the 2012 attacks on Benghazi while she was secretary of state were not conducted through normal procedures, according to FBI documents.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAn unnamed female State Department Office of the Inspector General employee with deep familiarity with how Clinton and her staff interacted with career professionals at the department's Freedom of Information Act requests told the FBI that Under Secretary of State for Management Patrick Kennedy was central to the narrative.Kennedy supervised the department's Office of Information Programs and Services, which handled FOIA requests. It was Kennedy, in August 2014, who sent out the memorandum to all State Department employees telling them they were not allowed to use personal emails for official business.The interview offered insights into internal dynamics of how the department worked-or did not work.The IG employee told the FBI:For the FOIA requests related to the 30,000 CLINTON-related emails and the Congressional inquiry that requested Benghazi-related emails, those [sic] review process were handled outside the normal chain of people.

""Good example, bad example? Am I totally off base?""Clinton argued that Republicans had failed by attacking her marriage, and that voters cared about the issues more than her relationship with her husband.""I feel like this is something that was dealt with in the nineties, and I am more than willing to have people draw their own conclusions,"" she said. ""But, I've been married now for a very long time and I'm very proud of that marriage.""Clinton explained that staying with Bill Clinton was the result of her ""values,"" and that she was proud of her daughter Chelsea and her two grandchildren.""I'm going to continue to live my life in accordance with my values and I'm very happy to have a life partner that I've been with for many, many years,"" she concluded.The transcript was emailed by Hillary Clinton's research director Tony Carrk to former Clinton adviser Karen Dunn, who was helping the campaign with debate preparations in January 2015.""This transcript is NOT public, but for reference for the answer,"" Carrk wrote, apparently discussing how Hillary Clinton would respond to debate questions about her relationship with Bill Clinton.Full transcript below:SIGN UP"

And that even includes one of the scientists who made the discovery in the first place.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe discovery was first announced in 2012 in a lecture by Professor Ryanga Myneni of the University of Boston.Rising CO2 levels are causing the planet to get greener, Myneni revealed. In the last 30 years, he estimated, the planet's greenery has increased by 14 per cent. About half of this, he calculated, was a direct result of increased carbon dioxide levels, rather than of other factors like warmth, irrigation or fertilisers. And the area covered is vast:  as Myneni's co-author Zaichun Zhu, of Beijing University, puts it, it's equivalent to adding a green continent twice the size of mainland USA. What's more, Myneni showed, this greening is taking place across the board, in all manner of vegetation: tropical rain forests, subarctic taiga, grasslands, semi-deserts, farmland, the lot.We have reported on this greening before at Breitbart here and here - and, of course, it's very good news. But it hasn't been widely circulated in much of the media for reasons which will soon become clear.The first person to break the good news was science author and journalist Matt Ridley, who wrote it up in the Wall Street Journal in a piece titled How Fossil Fuels Have Greened The Planet.He began:Did you know that the Earth is getting greener, quite literally? Satellites are now confirming that the amount of green vegetation on the planet has been increasing for three decades. This will be news to those accustomed to alarming tales about deforestation, overdevelopment and ecosystem destruction.Perhaps unsurprisingly, the notion that CO2 could be beneficial was not something the greenies wanted to hear. And that included the co-author of the study Ryanga Myneni, who did everything he could to discredit Ridley's (entirely accurate) account of his study.Ridley described what happened next in his recent Global Warming Policy Foundation lecture at the Royal Society in London.At the end of 2015, when his paper had been under peer review for eight months so he knew these results were coming, Dr Myneni, criticized me specifically, saying on a green blog that ""[Ridley] falsely claims that CO2 fertilisation is responsible for the greening of the earth"". Yet a few months later he himself published evidence that ""CO2 fertilisation explains 70% of the greening trend"".In the press release accompanying the article in April 2016 he once again referred to me by name:[""The beneficial aspect of CO2 fertilization in promoting plant growth has been used by contrarians, notably Lord Ridley...to argue against cuts in carbon emissions to mitigate climate change...""]As Richard Tol commented: ""The new paper vindicates what Matt Ridley and others have been saying all along -- yet they apparently deserve to be kicked nonetheless.""I wrote to Dr Myneni politely asking him to justify his criticism of me with specific examples. He was unable to do so. ""There are no 'up-sides' to having too much CO2 in the air,"" was all he said.Even now, Myneni is determinedly trying poo poo the significance of his own study. In response to Ridley's lecture he has issued an official statement at the University of Boston website, again pouring scorn on Ridley.Q: Is Greening not a good thing?
A: We do not fully understand the CO2 fertilization effect. Experiments do indicate a fertilization effect and higher water use efficiency. The same experiments also indicate diminishing effects over time. Moreover, we do not know how much of what we observe in experiments translates in to the real world. Much of this has to do with how nutrient limitations would play out when CO2 becomes abundant. In short, there is no evidence to count on CO2 fertilization benefit. Personally, I would not buy the fertilization benefit for the price of global warming (and all the impacts that this warming implies).Q: Are Climate Change (Global Warming) and attendant impacts real?
A: Lord Ridley discounts global warming and impacts. Yet, he is all for the fertilization benefit. He starts his talk with the statement ""I am a passionate champion of Science"" and goes on to ignore 30+ years of IPCC assessments! What is worse, he assumes that the people behind the science have malevolent motives (suppressing publication of our work ... etc). How sensible is it to argue that thousands and thousands of scientists are somehow in cahoots to push the global warming hoax on innocent people of the world ...Careful readers - and you really don't need a PhD to see through this: indeed it's probably a disadvantage - will note that at no stage do Myneni's disclaimers actually contradict the facts of his study, as faithfully and accurately reported by Ridley. His answer to the second question is just a succession of rhetorical fallacies: ad hominem, straw man, appeal to authority; his answer to the first, effectively admits that Ridley's interpretation is correct - ""experiments do indicate a fertilization effect and higher water use efficiency"" - but then tries to fudge his way out with a few airy denials.The other key accusation Ridley makes is that Myneni and his colleagues may deliberately have sought to delay publication of their report, lest skeptics take too much pleasure in it.Myneni's results, however, remained unpublished. I was puzzled by this. Then I realized that one of the IPCC's periodic assessment reports was in preparation, and that probably Dr Myneni and colleagues might delay the publication of their results until after that report was published, lest ""the skeptics have a field day"" with it.That last phrase, by the way, is from one of the Climategate emails, the one on 22 September 1999 in which Dr Michael Mann approves the deletion of inconvenient data.Sure enough, Myneni's results were eventually published three years later in April 2016 in a paper in Nature Climate Change, with 32 authors from 24 institutions in eight countries - when the IPCC report was safely in the public domain and the great Paris climate jamboree was over.Myneni makes his lengthy excuse at the Boston website, which I wouldn't bother reading unless you're feeling very patient. My translation: ""A very enormous dog ate my homework.""The Alarmist media, it goes without saying, are taking Myneni's side in this. The BBC's house eco-loon Roger Harrabin had this to say on Twitter:#globalgreening.

And an extraordinary place it is too. Scientists on the global warming gravy train, it seems, are so desperate to prop up the alarmist narrative - and the generous grant-funding that goes with it - even to the point of denying the significance of their own research.Did you know that the Earth is getting greener, quite literally?

It continued, ""The detainee was a financial and travel facilitator over an extended period of time for al-Qa'ida external operations chief Khaled Shaykh Muhammad and USS Cole bombing mastermind Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri.""The Miami Herald adds:Rabbani's brother Abdul Rahim was similarly reviewed and the board upheld his indefinite detention status in August. A 2009 federal task force recommended that the Rabbani brothers be considered for possible trial by federal or military court. But neither has ever been charged with a crime.A bipartisan bill, which President Obama signed into law, prevents the president from transferring detainees onto U.S. soil, a move that is part of a plan to close the facility that the Pentagon submitted to Congress earlier this year.In August, the Obama administration transferred 12 Yemenis and three Afghans, including two ""forever prisoners,"" from the U.S. military detention center to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), marking the largest detainee transfer under Obama's watch.The latest estimate by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) revealed that nearly 30 percent of Gitmo detainees who have been released are now either confirmed or suspected of having returned to terrorist activities.Hours after releasing a Mauritanian prisoner, the Pentagon disclosed Monday that the Guantanamo parole board has approved the release of an Afghan man -- meaning 20 of the last 60 captives can leave with security assurances that satisfy Secretary of Defense Ash Carter.However, the Board found that in light of the factors and conditions of transfer ... the threat the detainee presents can be adequately mitigated.

After the event at Trident Technical College, Clinton headed to a fundraiser at the home of Akim and Constance Anastopoulo.Other emails show staffers' concerns about Clinton's sleep schedule.On Oct. 11, 2015, top aide Huma Abedin explained a decision by Clinton to schedule a debate-practice session from 6.00 p.m. to 9.00 p.m. ""We have an event in the window that she originally suggested,"" Abedin wrote. ""Evening is probably better on body clock too, no? That was part of our thinking.""In January 2011, Abedin reminded Clinton to take a nap before a 3.30 p.m. meeting, according to an email released by the U.S. Department of State.A January 2013 email, released by the Department of State, shows Abedin saying ""she's often confused,"" in response to an email saying that Clinton was taking a nap.This October 2015 email from Wikileaks, shows Podesta saying Clinton need to rest.

The reporter asked Obama to comment about the increased inflow of Central American migrants.""No, actually, David, they spiked heavily in 2014, went down significantly in 2015, have gone back up this year, in part because there's still desperation in Central America, but are still not at the levels they were in 2014,"" Obama said to the Washington Post reporter, David Nakamura.The data from Obama's own agency proves him wrong.Here are the charts released by the Department of Homeland Security, showing the number of migrants who arrived at  the border  in ""family units,"" or while claiming to ""Unaccompanied Alien Children,"" younger than 18.The total 2016 inflow from the three Central American countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras adds up to 117,200, according to the federal data.Here are the 2014 numbers, according to the Department of Homeland Security, which add up to 112,749.So the 2016 inflow of 117,200 is larger than the 2014 inflow of 112,749.The increase from 2014 to 2016 means that Obama was incorrect when he claimed that ""No, actually, David, they spiked heavily in 2014 ... have gone back up this year ... but are still not at the levels they were in 2014.""The 2014 inflow was a shock to Washington and the public, and it helped derail the so-called ""Comprehensive Immigration Reform"" push by progressive and business groups.Obama's error may have been caused by the department's standard practice of displaying the inflow of Mexicans alongside alongside the inflow of Central American migrants. Many reporters have inadvertently commingled the two sets of numbers.According to a careful reading of the DHS reports, 21,264 Mexican ""UACs"" and members of ""family units"" were detained at the border in 2014. Many or all chose to be apprehended by the border patrol in the hope of applying for easy asylum rules that Obama is offering to Central American migrants.But Mexicans are not eligible for Obama's Central American migration rules, so the number of Mexican migrant ""UACs"" and family units declined from 21,264 in 2014 down to 15,407 in 2016. That decline was enough to keep the combined 2016 inflow of Mexican and Central American would-be migrants below the 2014 level.But the Washington Post reporter and Obama were not talking about all migrants -- they were talking about only Central American migrants, whose total numbers in 2016 were higher than in 2014.Here's the White House transcript of the question and answer, starting with comments from President Obama.But one area where we have seen a big spike over the last several years is actually from the smaller countries in Central America where the economy is doing poorly; agriculture has done poorly, in part because of changing weather patterns; violence brought on by narco-traffickers.  So Vice President Biden, I gave him the charge of working with those countries to come up with a development plan.  Congress, on a bipartisan basis, supported us putting more money into these countries for development, more effective policing, dealing with fighting the narco-traffickers in a more effective way, investing in young people.  But that's not going to happen overnight.  That will be a decade-long process, potentially. In the meantime, we insist that those countries cooperate with us to send a message to the populations that it is a dangerous trip to reach the United States, and if you get here, you're likely to be turned back, to try to discourage this dangerous passage but also to try to undermine the human traffickers who are preying on the desperation of these people to make money...      Q    Central Americans, numbers have --      PRESIDENT OBAMA:  That's what I just said.  I said Central America -- they've increased, David.  Why --     Q    I was wondering if you could comment about whether (inaudible) policy.     PRESIDENT OBAMA:  No, actually, David, they spiked heavily in 2014, went down significantly in 2015, have gone back up this year, in part because there's still desperation in Central America, but are still not at the levels they were in 2014.  But I appreciate you shouting out a question, since I'm sure there are a lot of other colleagues of yours who would want to do the same.  (Laughter.)      Thank you very much, everybody.  Appreciate it.Before Obama changed the migration rules in 2010 and 2011, Central American migrants who tried to sneak across the border were routinely sent home by the border patrol. Since Obama quietly changed the rules, migrants from Central American -- chiefly El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala -- are now welcomed across the border to legally begin the years-long process of requesting asylum, and are sent to local bus stations so they move to cities around the nation.While they're waiting for their court dates in 2017, 2018, 2019 or later, Obama allows the migrants to compete against Americans for jobs and also to crowd into already-failing American schools in California and Maryland, Massachusetts and Colorado, and many other states. Obama has even set up a process where additional Central Americans can apply to the local U.S. embassy for approval to migrate into the United States.Obama is a progressive, and he has repeatedly said that Americans have no moral or legal right to restrict migration, and he has repeatedly said that migrants make America better.But he knows his migration is deeply unpopular, so he's only offering the asylum deal to Central Americans under the media-magnified claim that they're fleeing violence. In contrast, the cross-border flow of Mexicans has been kept down, in part, because they're not supposed to be allowed file for asylum. For example, the number of Mexican youths who crossed the border in 2014 was 15,634, and was just 11,926 in 2016.Roughly speaking, if all of the Central American migrants are granted asylum, they will cost American taxpayers more than $192 billion over the next 75 years. Those costs include welfare, wage subsidies and K-12 education for the migrants' children. Very few of the Central American migrants have useful skills for a high-tech economy.Note: This Breitbart editor has also shouted an immigration question during a Rose Garden event. The question was asked when Obama announced his decision in June 2012 to grant work-permits to almost 1 million younger illegal immigrants, during an economic slowdown that had forced many Americans out of the job market. The question asked was ""Why do you prefer foreigners over American workers?"" 
But one area where we have seen a big spike over the last several years is actually from the smaller countries in Central America where the economy is doing poorly; agriculture has done poorly, in part because of changing weather patterns; violence brought on by narco-traffickers. 
 So Vice President Biden, I gave him the charge of working with those countries to come up with a development plan.  Congress, on a bipartisan basis, supported us putting more money into these countries for development, more effective policing, dealing with fighting the narco-traffickers in a more effective way, investing in young people.

SIGN UPBut one area where we have seen a big spike over the last several years is actually from the smaller countries in Central America where the economy is doing poorly; agriculture has done poorly, in part because of changing weather patterns; violence brought on by narco-traffickers.  So Vice President Biden, I gave him the charge of working with those countries to come up with a development plan.  Congress, on a bipartisan basis, supported us putting more money into these countries for development, more effective policing, dealing with fighting the narco-traffickers in a more effective way, investing in young people.  But that's not going to happen overnight.  That will be a decade-long process, potentially. In the meantime, we insist that those countries cooperate with us to send a message to the populations that it is a dangerous trip to reach the United States, and if you get here, you're likely to be turned back, to try to discourage this dangerous passage but also to try to undermine the human traffickers who are preying on the desperation of these people to make money.     Q    Central Americans, numbers have --     PRESIDENT OBAMA:  That's what I just said.  I said Central America -- they've increased, David.  Why --     Q    I was wondering if you could comment about whether (inaudible) policy.     PRESIDENT OBAMA:  No, actually, David, they spiked heavily in 2014, went down significantly in 2015, have gone back up this year, in part because there's still desperation in Central America, but are still not at the levels they were in 2014.

David Vitter (R-LA) found the Clintons' close relationship with Gilbert Chagoury, whose company pledged $1 billion to the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) in 2009, played a role in Secretary Clinton's delay in deeming the Nigeria-based Boko Haram as a terrorist group.The CGI is a non-profit organization launched by former President Bill Clinton and the Clinton Foundation in 2005.Transcripts of former President Clinton's speech at a campaign fundraiser for his wife were made public after being emailed to current Hillary campaign chairman John Podesta as an attachment.The speech reportedly took place behind closed doors, right outside of Washington, D.C. back in October 2015.Bill Clinton told donors:In Nigeria, for example, where Boko Haram is located, my foundation is working in the exact same areas trying to save the lives of (inaudible) children who die from diarrhea with a simple oral rehydration (inaudible) package that costs 50 cents to save the life of a child.Although the Clinton Foundation appears to have provided aid for some in Nigeria, it is unclear if any of the boys and girls were from territory controlled by Boko Haram, which lies in the northeastern part of the country.Citing the United Nations Children's Fund, known as UNICEF, Newsweek reported in July that nearly 50,000  ""children are suffering from severe acute malnutrition in [northeastern Nigeria's] Borno state, the birthplace of the militant group... Of these, 49,000--around one in five children--will die if they do not receive treatment soon as the humanitarian response to the crisis wanes.""In September, The Associated Press (AP) learned from intelligence agency Stratfor that Boko Haram in northeastern Nigeria is ""largely responsible"" for a resurgence of polio, which affects children and causes severe paralysis.The Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), a nonprofit launched by the Clinton Foundation in 2010, joined the governments of Nigeria and Norway as well as non-governmental organizations, business leaders, and civil society to launch the Saving One Million Lives (SOML) effort in 2012.""Under this program, the [Nigerian] Ministry [of Health] has set a new goal of saving one million lives of women and children and improving the quality of care in Nigeria in 2013 by focusing on evidence-based interventions expected to have the greatest impact on lives saved,"" noted the Clinton Foundation in an October 2012 press release announcing SOML.The initiative was primarily aimed at reducing ""child mortality by rapidly increasing access to the most effective diarrhea treatment--zinc and oral rehydration solutions (ORS).""By the beginning of 2015, CHAI's Zinc and ORS Program, which was focused on India, Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda, had ""reached nearly 250 million people"" included ""a network of nearly 150,000 service providers,"" according to the United Nations.The Clinton Health Access Initiative set a goal in 2012 to increase ""the percent of children with diarrhea who received ORS and zinc to 80% by 2015 could help prevent 220,000 Nigerian children from dying.""Hillary's designation of Boko Haram as a terrorist group would have severely inhibited the business dealings of Lebanese construction magnate and longtime friend of former President Bill Clinton Chagoury in Nigeria.A top-prosecutor in Nigeria named the Clinton Foundation top donor a ""kingpin"" of corruption after he made it possible for Nigerian Military Dictator Sani Abacha to steal billions of dollars from the African country.He was subsequently convicted in Switzerland of money-laundering and helping a criminal organization in connection to the stolen money, but later entered a plea-deal and the charges were expunged.Chagoury, who was once on a U.S. no-fly list, also confessed in a British court to assisting the Abacha family in transferring $300 million into foreign bank accounts.Nevertheless, the Clinton Foundation gladly accepted a $1 million to $5 million donation from the nefarious figure.The Clinton Foundation claimed in 2012:CHAI began its work in Nigeria in 2007 with programs including in the Niger Delta to strengthen the conflicted region's HIV/AIDS service infrastructure, which has resulted in a 350% increase in pediatric testing and 70% increase in access to pediatric antiretroviral drugs. CHAI is now taking this vanguard approach to improve access to essential medicines for children, helping to unite businesses, NGOs, and donor organizations around this cause in support of SOML.In Nigeria, for example, where Boko Haram is located, my foundation is working in the exact same areas trying to save the lives of (inaudible) children who die from diarrhea with a simple oral rehydration (inaudible) package that costs 50 cents to save the life of a child.CHAI began its work in Nigeria in 2007 with programs including in the Niger Delta to strengthen the conflicted region's HIV/AIDS service infrastructure, which has resulted in a 350% increase in pediatric testing and 70% increase in access to pediatric antiretroviral drugs.

"Republican Donald Trump will likely win the third presidential debate on Wednesday evening at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe question is whether his victory will matter enough to shift the polls, after so much damage has been done by recent accusations of sexual impropriety, which were delivered in carefully coordinated media attacks in the aftermath of the first debate on Sep. 26.Trump will likely benefit from an ""October surprise"" of his own -- namely, the release of videos by James O'Keefe's Project Veritas that show high-level Democratic political consultants taking credit for inciting violence at Trump rallies over the past year. Already, the revelations have forced senior consultant Robert Creamer -- with close ties to the Hillary Clinton campaign and the White House -- to step down, along with one of his lieutenants. More resignations may be coming, given evidence the campaign may have illegally coordinated with super PACs to carry out various political operations.Two other factors favor Trump. One is the continued presence of low expectations for Trump, which persist in spite of the fact that he out-boxed his rival at the second debate. The second is the fact that the moderator is Fox News' Chris Wallace, who can be tough on Republicans at times, but is likely to be less intrusive and one-sided than any of the other moderators have been thus far.The question is whether it will matter. Third debates, in general, provide opportunities for closing arguments -- not fourth-quarter theatrics.In 2012, Republican Mitt Romney miscalculated badly in the third debate, thinking he was sitting on a lead in the polls. He strained to point out commonalities between himself and President Barack Obama, rather than articulating differences. Trump will not make the same mistake, but might have preferred to showcase a calm demeanor in his final pitch to the electorate. Instead, he will have to throw uppercuts, hoping for a knockout, while Clinton dodges and deflects.High risk, high reward: a fitting end to campaign 2016.Joel B.

The union has been around for more than 80 years, and currently boasts a membership of approximately 60,000 people.""The use of taco trucks is a reference to a threat by a Latino Trump supporter last month that if his chosen candidate loses, the country would see a ""taco truck on every corner,"" thanks to increased illegal immigration and Mexicans' allegedly ""dominant culture.""Trump's hotel is frequently targeted by unions and Democrats prior to political debates and elections. Last October, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton attended a union rally outside the Trump Hotel, in support of efforts to unionize the hotel's workforce.In February, prior to the state's Republican caucuses, unions again picketed the hotel, which site just off Las Vegas Boulevard (the ""Strip""), on Fashion Show Drive.The Trump Hotel's culinary workforce reportedly joined Local 226 recently, but the hotel's management has declined to recognize the union for the purposes of collective bargaining.Unions became a dominant force in local politics as Las Vegas expanded rapidly in the 1990s, and remain so despite the deep downturn in the city's fortunes after the 2008 recession.The Trump campaign's Hispanic outreach director, A.J. Delgado, told Buzzfeed: ""I never, EVER turn down a chance to eat some good tacos.""The protest is not expected to block access to the hotel itself, where the Trump family typically stays when in town, and which would likely be protected by Secret Service.Joel B.

She says that Clinton departed after she purportedly refused to respond.WATCH THE VIDEO BELOW:Millwee says she was thinking about coming out publicly around 1998, when the Monica Lewinsky scandal began to dominate the national conversation.  But at the time, she says she decided to remain quiet, in part fearing for her children after watching the way other Clinton sex accusers were treated by the Clintons and the news media.Three of Millwee's friends told Breitbart News that she told them in the late 1990's that Clinton sexually assaulted her while she was a reporter and that the future president allegedly knocked on her apartment door.Millwee claims the assaults took place in a small, isolated editing room at her now defunct station, KLMN-TV, which covered the Fort Smith/Fayetteville markets.  At the time Millwee reported under the assumed name Leslie Derrick.As part of her job, Millwee says that she covered the so-called Cuban Refugee Crisis, which took place in 1980 when about 125,000 Cubans fled their homeland in boats and were allowed into the U.S.  By May 1980, about 20,000 refugees were housed at Fort Chaffee, Arkansas's military base, creating security and law enforcement problems for then Governor Clinton with refugees rioting and escaping the compound.Millwee says she interviewed Clinton about 20 times at various public events and at Fort Chaffee, and saw him inside the KLMN station.She claims that when she was around him, Clinton singled her out with ""inappropriate gestures,"" and that he made flirtatious comments like, ""Hey pretty girl. How are you today?"" This went on, Millwee says, for several months.Millwee claims that as part of his attempts to come on to her, Clinton gave her half of his tie and told her that she should give him more attention and hold onto the tie because one day he would be the U.S. president.She also says that Clinton signed his name to a page on her reporter's notebook that had her own name on it, writing ""Clinton"" directly above her name.""And I said, 'What are you doing? Giving me an autograph now?' And he said, 'No, I just wanted to show you how good Clinton looks on top of Leslie.'""Millwee provided Breitbart News with an image of Clinton's alleged signature on her reporter's notebook. (see below)Clinton's alleged signature on Millwee's reporter's notebookAs part of Millwee's work, she says that she edited her own stories in the small editing room.Karen Pharis, who was Millwee's assignments editor and later became KLMN TV's acting News Director in Fort Smith, confirmed to Breitbart News that as a reporter Millwee edited her own footage in the editing room, which Pharis recalled as being a ""tiny"" and isolated room about the size of a bedroom walk-in closet.Pharis confirmed that Millwee was a reporter at KLMN and that Millwee's job ""absolutely"" included her conducting interviews with Bill Clinton.Pharis said she does not remember Clinton coming to the station more than ""maybe twice,"" but she also said that she would not have always been present if Clinton was at the station.Pharis said that she remembers Millwee leaving the station abruptly sometime around 1980, but she was not provided with a reason. Pharis said Millwee was a good employee and that she was surprised when Millwee departed.Pharis said that Millwee did not tell her about her story with Clinton until about a year ago.Pharis said she finds Millwee to be credible and that she has no reason to doubt Millwee's story, explaining that it was a different climate in 1980 for female sexual assault accusers to go public or to tell their superiors about alleged assaults.Pharis is currently the General Manager of the Fort Smith Radio Group, which operates five local radio stations.  She is also active in her local community, serving as the Secretary of the Van Buren Civil Service Commission; and is an Advisory Board Member of the Fort Smith Adult Education Center, and a Board Member of The Degen Foundation.Pharis insisted that it is not unusual for there to be no video archives for KLMN TV, explaining that many times reporters would tape over the footage from the day before.It was in that editing room, Millwee claims, that Clinton sexually assaulted her on three occasions.She described the first alleged assault:""...he followed me into an editing room. The first time I remember. That it was very small. There was a chair. I was sitting in a chair. He came up behind me and started rubbing my shoulders and running his hands down toward my breasts. And I was just stunned. I froze. I asked him to stop. He laughed.""That happened on three occasions. And each time it escalated where the aggressive nature of his touch and what he was doing behind me escalated.""She says that after the first alleged assault, Millwee told Clinton to not repeat the alleged inappropriate acts. She says Clinton laughed in response.The second and third alleged assaults involved Clinton rubbing his genitalia against Millwee, she says.The second time took place about a week later, according to Millwee. ""He made a beeline immediately for me. I excused myself; went to the editing room.""She continued:""And he came in behind me. Started hunching me to the point that he had an orgasm. He's trying to touch my breasts. And I'm just sitting there very stiffly, just waiting for him to leave me alone. And I'm asking him the whole time, 'Please do not do this. Do not touch me. Do not hunch me. I do not want this.'""And he finished doing what he was doing and he walked out.""""He took out his private parts?"" I asked.""I do not know,"" Millwee replied. ""I did not see that. I could feel what he was doing from behind me. I do not know if he had taken, you know, private parts out. Or if he was doing it. I assumed he was doing it through material but I could be wrong.""Millwee claims the second alleged assault lasted ""probably three to five minutes. And I am asking him the whole time to please stop.""On the third alleged occasion, Millwee claims that Clinton did ""basically the same thing he did on the second time. Came in, hunched me from behind. Grabbing my shoulders, and you know, having an orgasm and then leaving.""""I was crying,"" Millwee added. ""The third time it happened it was just so overwhelming. I waited a few minutes. I came out. I went into the ladies' room. I was crying and very upset. And we had a lady that had a local show there and she actually came into the bathroom. An older lady. And she said, 'Honey, what is wrong?' And I said I just had a really bad experience and I don't really want to talk about it. But I'm very upset.""She said that she felt ""trapped"" in the editing room, and that she felt there was ""nothing I could do to stop him once he started.""I asked Millwee why she would go into the editing room three times if she purportedly knew that each time Clinton came to the station he would allegedly trap her in the editing room.Millwee replied:""For one thing, the first time he did not complete the sex act. It was more touching and fondling. The second time, I went in. I was stunned. And I believe the third time he was not even in the building when I went in to finish my story. If my memory serves me correctly he had gone into the television station and was seeking me out. 'Where is Leslie?' And in fact, like I said earlier I believed that it was somebody coming in to rush me along with the story. I didn't even realize that he was in the building so I wouldn't have thought that it was him that came in.""Millwee claims that after the third alleged assault, Clinton showed up at her apartment while her grandmother was staying with her, knocked on her door and tried to get her to let him inside.  She says her grandmother was staying with her for weeks at a time because she says she felt that Clinton was getting out of hand and that made her afraid.""He knocked on the door for probably five, ten minutes,"" she said. ""Knocking. Calling my name. Saying, 'I know you are home. Please answer the door.' I did not answer the door.""Millwee says that for her, Clinton allegedly showing up at her apartment was ""just the final straw and after staying up most of the night discussing it with my grandmother I decided then and there that I was going to leave the station.""She says that she actually saw Clinton while covering the Oklahoma State Fair the next day and the two acted as if nothing had allegedly happened the night before.Asked why she is speaking now, she stated, ""I'm very comfortable where I am at now in life.""Millwee continued:""I almost came out during the Monica Lewinsky and Kathleen Willey situation. I watched that unfold a little bit. I was very prepared to go forward then and talk about it. And I watched the way the Clintons and Hillary slandered those women. Harassed them. Did unthinkable things to them. And I just did not want to be part of that. I had very small children at the time. I had a job in pharmaceuticals. It was a very conservative situation. I didn't want to do anything to bring harm to my career. And my family.""It was very scary watching all of that. And I've shared that with some of the other women that have been victims. I just didn't want to go through that at the time. It was more about my kids than anything.""Millwee explained that in 1980 the climate was different for female sexual assault accusers, and says that she didn't tell many people immediately after the incident. She said that she told her mother and the grandmother who she says was present when Clinton allegedly knocked on her apartment door. She says she also told her current husband when they met in 1981.Millwee said that she began to tell others around 1998, after the Lewinsky story broke.Millwee told friends in the late 1990sThe three that Millwee told in the late 1990s are Fran Kaminsky, a friend and former co-worker; Angela Malaer, a friend and Millwee's son's fourth-grade teacher during the Lewinsky scandal; and Ronald Scott, a Houston-based retired lawyer.""Leslie is one of the most frank, credible people I know,"" said Scott. ""She is not manipulative about what she says concerning people or events she is involved in. She tells it like it is.""Scott describes himself as a steadfast advocate for Hillary Clinton and a small donor to her campaign.  In a phone interview, Scott had no kind words for Donald Trump. ""I think Trump is an egomaniac who must not become president,"" he said.Malaer says that when Millwee first told her about the alleged incidents with Clinton, she remembers Millwee stating at the time that she didn't want to go public.  ""She thought it would be too stressful, too emotional"" to go public, Malaer said.Vetting MillweeAn issue with fully verifying Millwee's claims is that despite extensive searches, Breitbart News was unable to track down any of her alleged interviews with Clinton or the now defunct KLMN-TV's general archives.Former station employees and current owners said they believe the archives no longer exist.  The Fort Smith Historical Society and the Archives of Public Communication at the University of Arkansas said they did not ay information on the existence of station archives, either.The Fort Smith/Fayetteville station changed owners and affiliations at various point in its history. From 1978 to 1980, KLMN-TV was a CBS affiliate.In 1980, KLMN-TV swapped affiliations with KFSM-TV and became an NBC affiliate. In 1982, KLMN-TV changed its call sign to KPOM-TV (People On the Move), a name it held until 2005.KPOM continued to produce a news product from 1982 to 1990 but it went out of the news business from 1990 to 2000.It reentered the news market as the Fox-affiliated KFTA, the sister-station to the NBC affiliate KNWA-TV.  Those stations were unable to establish the existence of any KLMN archives.Getting the jobMeanwhile, Millwee did provide Breitbart News with copies of letters sent to the station thanking her for reports as well as a copy of her access document signed by the base security chief to enter the refugee area of Fort Chaffee.And she recounted how she says she first got her job as a TV news reporter:""I graduated a year early from high school - went to college while I was working for a professional soccer team in Tulsa (the Tulsa Roughnecks). I worked with the media there and had a lot of TV contacts. One of my contacts from Channel 8 KTUL TV told me there was a reporter opening in Arkansas and I should apply... I did and got offered the job on the spot.""Book InconsistenciesThis is not the first time Millwee told her story in a public forum.  She wrote about some of her alleged experiences with Clinton in a January 2011 paperback book titled, You Can't Make This Stuff Up!   The Clinton experiences were confined to a few paragraphs in one of the book's chapters and was not the main subject matter of the book.   A blurb for the book stated, ""A true Southern girl, Millwee examines life through the eyes of a child, as a young woman, and as a grown-up Southern belle who finally addresses why all things happen for a reason.""The work was published by Tate Publishing, which describes itself as a ""Christian-based, family-owned, mainline publishing organization with a mission to discover and market unknown authors.""The book, which has zero reviews at Amazon as of this writing, was published with some grammar and copy errors.  Her claims in the book about Clinton received no news media attention at the time, and the book does not seem to have been marketed in a significant way.In the book, Millwee only describes one alleged incident involving Clinton inappropriately touching her in the editing room and not the three alleged events that she detailed in the Breitbart interview.  In her book, Leslie claimed that Clinton cornered her in the editing room and touched her shoulder, but she did not mention anything about him allegedly touching her breasts or rubbing himself against her.Asked to explain the seeming discrepancy, Millwee stated:""I decided as I wrote and organized that I would not put anything that seemed sexual in nature, as far as details, etc. I wanted to put a book on the shelf that could be read by adults, or teens, or proudly tell people about it at church. This story is hugely important to me, but this venue didn't seem the appropriate one to discuss details. The story was written in the context of helping others to understand the lack of a moral compass, compassion, and integrity. I feel I accomplished that without sharing specific details.""Millwee claims in the book that Clinton had singled her out at the television station and that ""everyone"" in the newsroom teased her about it.  She also claimed that Clinton periodically stopped by the station.Millwee wrote:""I remember the first time everyone in the newsroom teased me about the governor. He was using our station periodically while making his regular trips to Ft. Chaffee, and he would walk in the room and greet us all. He approached me, patted me on the shoulder, and said, 'How are you doing, pretty lady?' I was so embarrassed and I am sure I turned a bright shade of red. I was keenly aware that he had approached me first, and was giving me some unwarranted attention.""Millwee described one occasion of Clinton allegedly touching her in the editing room:""I had been absorbed in editing my story for that day and the door had opened behind me. I didn't even turn around. I was busy trying to finish, and just figured someone was trying to hurry me along. I was wrong. I didn't hear anything, and was getting ready to turn around when I felt hands on my shoulders. Immediately, I knew it wasn't one of my peers. I felt his hands rub across my shoulders. I knew it was the governor. I was so frozen I couldn't turn around.""He leaned toward the back of my head and asked, ""How are you doing, pretty lady?"" I didn't move a muscle. I was petrified. Looking back, I don't think he meant to scare or startle me like that; he realized I was uncomfortable, and was quick to try and smooth things over. He made some light conversation, talking a few more minutes, and walked out as quietly as he had entered.""Millwee wrote that the alleged incident caused her to ""dread"" going back into the newsroom.""I knew what everyone would think. I knew everyone would want to know what happened. I was told later he'd come into the station, asked if I was there, and they had directed him to the editing room. I was absolutely mortified. I hated everyone thinking that something had happened.""In her book, Millwee related the story of Clinton allegedly showing up at her apartment, knocking on the door, calling her by the name and then departing.She wrote that she saw Clinton the next day but she didn't write where:""I hoped he had gone back to Little Rock, and I wouldn't see him the next day. As it turned out, I did see him. Absolutely nothing was said. No hint of impropriety, any comment or conversation. We were cordial and discussed relevant events that were pertinent to something I was working on. We made eye contact one time. I felt like he knew that I knew he had been there. I quickly averted my eyes. I was determined to dismiss the whole situation. I never said one word about it, nor did he. I was relieved things had played out the way they did. I was ecstatic my nanny had been there with me.""Millwee further used the book to relate stories from when she was a reporter assigned from the station to cover the Cuban refugees housed at Fort Chaffee.In one chapter, she wrote that around June 1, 1980 riots broke out at Fort Chaffee and that, according to her recollection, about 3,000 refugees had stormed the gates and the base was put on lockdown for a period of time.The Fort Chaffee Task Force Resettlement Operation After Action Report documents 300-400 demonstrators jumped the barriers May 26, 1980, and it relates other instances of rioting, with 300 to 400 attempting to leave the front gate on June 1, 1980, but they were repelled by State Police.The Washington Post later put the number of rioters on June 1 at about 1,000.In the book, Millwee wrote that President Jimmy Carter visited Fort Chaffee. However, neither records nor news reports of Carter visiting could be found and the purported visit was not mentioned in the military's After Action report, which did document numerous trips to Fort Chaffee by Clinton.News reports document that when the rioting ran out of control, Carter sent a White House aide, Gene Eidenberg, who met with Clinton and federal agency representatives at Fort Chaffee.In her book, Milwee says she took her grandmother to the fair with the promise of introducing her to Clinton, not the normal actions of a 20-year-old girl who was afraid of Clinton and says her grandmother was called in to protect her.Asked to explain that part of the book, Millwee replied in an email follow up:""Clinton was quite kind to my Grandmother. As upset as she was at his behavior toward me and recent events, she lived in a very different world that we live in today - sexual behavior like his was not discussed or usually, acknowledged. Certainly not in a public forum. Because of her association with me, he singled her out and talked to her and told her how happy he was to meet her. In spite of the circumstances, she was flattered that he had made an effort to greet her.""My grandmother and I talked about it later that night, and many times over the years. We agreed his behavior was deplorable and unacceptable, but she believed the best way to handle a circumstance such as this was to take yourself away from the situation. While she respected the office he held, she did not condone his behavior toward me, but she would never have confronted him or taken action against him, either. She was a true lady in every sense of the word and that is just the way things were handled in her generation.""FITS CLINTON PATTERNMillwee's claims seem to fit a larger pattern of Clinton's alleged behavior.Gennifer Flowers, who says she was Clinton's mistress for 12 years, was a local television news reporter when Clinton first approached her in 1977.Millwee's story about Clinton allegedly showing up at her apartment fits with the larger story painted by Clinton's rape accuser Juanita Broaddrick, who told this reporter that Clinton allegedly called Broaddrick's office for weeks after the alleged rape in an attempt to meet her again.Also, Paula Jones stated on this reporter's radio program last February that Clinton and his surrogates repeatedly propositioned her after their original infamous alleged encounter on May 8, 1991.

Certainly not in a public forum. Because of her association with me, he singled her out and talked to her and told her how happy he was to meet her. In spite of the circumstances, she was flattered that he had made an effort to greet her.
""My grandmother and I talked about it later that night, and many times over the years. We agreed his behavior was deplorable and unacceptable, but she believed the best way to handle a circumstance such as this was to take yourself away from the situation. While she respected the office he held, she did not condone his behavior toward me, but she would never have confronted him or taken action against him, either. She was a true lady in every sense of the word and that is just the way things were handled in her generation.""SIGN UP Aaron Klein is Breitbart's Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

His running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, also bested Clinton's sidekick Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) in the vice presidential debate.Aides tells Breitbart News they think Trump's success in the second debate came from in-depth preparation on policy issues along with detailed facts about Clinton's various scandals. Aides to Trump tell Breitbart News to expect a performance similar to the St. Louis debate--albeit perhaps even more aggressive--with even more of a focus on the core questions about Clinton and the entire political establishment backing her that Trump says shows there is a ""rigged"" system.The final debate comes amid the rockiest stretch of a debilitating campaign for both parties' nominees.Trump has just begun reestablishing himself in the wake of a series of allegations--with questionable timing, little to no evidence and in some cases contradictory witnesses--from a variety of women that he allegedly groped them. The Trump team is fighting back against those allegations, denying them and saying that the media are trying to ""poison"" the minds of voters with unsubstantiated allegations this close to an election.Meanwhile, James O'Keefe's Project Veritas has cut out the beating heart of the Institutional Left with his latest investigation into voter fraud and collusion and coordination among a variety of progressive organization.O'Keefe's investigations--two videos are already public and sources say more are on the way--have already forced the resignations of two high-level Democratic activists featured in them. Scott Foval has been removed from Americans United for Change (AUC), a progressive organization on the front lines of organizing leftist causes. And now Robert Creamer has stepped aside from his role at Democracy Partners with regard to coordination between the Clinton campaign, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and leftist organizations. All that comes amid an avalanche of emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta published by WikiLeaks, and new revelations that Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy sought a ""quid pro quo"" with the FBI on email classification during the Clinton email scandal investigation.The debate here on Wednesday evening, moderated by the Fox News Channel's Chris Wallace, is not expected to move the race back out of the gutter. In fact, to the contrary, sources on both sides say expect the fight to get rougher--especially as Wallace is expected to, more so than any other moderator so far, be tough on both candidates.On Trump's side, the stakes are extraordinarily high.While polls have tightened in the wake of his recent controversies, Trump remains the underdog. It's a place he likes to be, with his back against the wall fighting for survival before turning the circumstances around entirely while shocking his opponents, but it's not the best place for a candidate to be this deep into October.Trump needs another performance like what he had in St. Louis. Trump has delivered a series of speeches nationwide since he won the GOP nomination officially in Cleveland in July, but has yet to truly showcase his ""America First"" agenda on the national stage.For Clinton, she's coasting with a slight lead in most recent polling--but not a comfortable enough lead where her campaign thinks this election is locked up--so sources say to expect Clinton to bob and weave away from confrontation with Trump. She has a fine line to walk in this final debate where she doesn't want to seem complacent and allow Trump to surge back into contention, but she also doesn't want to go to overtly aggressive and make mistakes that Trump can capitalize on.SIGN UP"
