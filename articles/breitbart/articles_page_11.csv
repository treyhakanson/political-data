""We're doing a lot of things to clean up the system. But everybody that works for government, they then leave government and they become a lobbyist, essentially. I mean, the whole place is one big lobbyist.""During Trump's presidential campaign, he promised to institute a five year ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after leaving government service. He also promised to create a lifetime ban of White House officials lobbying for a foreign government.Trump indicated he would need politically connected people to help him know the system, even if they were lobbyists.""I'm saying that they know the system right now, but we're going to phase that out,"" he said during the 60 Minutes interview. ""You have to phase it out.""Trump also reaffirmed his belief in term limits for members of Congress.""We're going to put on term limits, which a lot of people aren't happy about, but we're putting on term limits,"" he said.SIGN UP"

I would have even bigger a reason to celebrate the Donald Trump victory than I do already.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERMake no mistake, the Donald Trump presidency represents the biggest blow yet to the Great Global Warming Swindle.Climategate was merely an amuse-gueule. This is the main event because it won't just involve cross words in the blogosphere but actual deeds.Specifically, those deeds will involve the U.S. withdrawing from the (albeit toothless and meaningless) COP21 climate agreement (aka ""Clexit""); the effective dismantling of the Environmental Protection Agency by the able and sensible Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute; and also, I would suspect, much laxer federal regulations on matters like fracking, oil pipelines, and fossil fuels generally, as well as an end to the massive subsidies paid to renewables such as the bat-chomping, bird-slicing eco-crucifixes which the President-Elect is so right to hate.For the Greenies, all this must seem like Armageddon come early.Just listen, for example, to the tragic wailing coming from the EPA:U.S. EPA employees were in tears. Worried Energy Department staffers were offered counseling. Some federal employees were so depressed, they took time off. Others might retire early.And some employees are in downright panic mode in the aftermath of Donald Trump's victory.""People are upset. Some people took the day off because they were depressed,"" said John O'Grady, president of American Federation of Government Employees Council 238, a union that represents thousands of EPA employees. After Election Day, ""people were crying,"" added O'Grady, who works in EPA's Region 5 office in Chicago. ""They were recommending that people take sick leave and go home.""If I were them, I wouldn't bother coming back.I really don't think it's possible to exaggerate just what a world of pain is coming to the greenies thanks to Donald J Trump.This will, of course, be spun in most of the mainstream media as a truly terrible thing. And that view will be echoed across a global establishment which has unquestioningly bought in to the climate change narrative and often benefited financially from it. Never forget that the global warming industry is worth annually about the same as the online shopping industry - about $1.5 trillion. An awful lot of people depend for their livelihoods on ""global warming"" being a thing. They're not going to take the loss of their main source of income lying down: I expect the climate propaganda war is going to get a lot more vicious in the next four years, with Trump being vilified as a thuggish, anti-science ignoramus, hell bent on crass economic growth at the expense of the planet and future generations, and with his few supporters in the media being mocked, scorned, and marginalised as rabid, contrarian loons.But that's OK. Those of us on the sceptical side of the climate argument have two massive points in our favour.One is that we're right - all the facts are on our side. (The establishment elite just hasn't caught up with this yet.)And the other thing is that the tide of history is on our side. We've finally got our man in the White House; the field is ours.My view is that this is going to be very good for the U.S. economy. At the weekend, I spoke on a panel at Oxford University on the subject of democracy. (I'll be putting up the video when my cameraman has edited it.) One of the professors on my panel poured scorn on Trump's promise to create jobs and prosperity - arguing that it had no plausible foundation.I disagreed. Even if you have doubts about his other economic plans, Trump's war on the Green Blob is going to make America a lot more prosperous. By driving down the cost of energy it will mean people have more disposable income; it will create jobs for workers in fossil fuel industries (the coal states will benefit especially); and it will make heavy industry more viable, meaning that U.S. jobs can be restored from abroad.There will, I suspect, be knock-on benefits to the global economy too. Once other countries see the effects of Trump's anti-renewables, pro-fossil-fuel revolution, they'll find it harder to justify to their electorates the massive costs of the lunatic green energy policy by which the West has been held to ransom these last few decades.The green war on Western industrial civilisation has been going on for so long I feared I'd never live to see the counterattack.Now that it's happening, I'm so shocked I feel almost as shocked as the greenies are. But it is happening nonetheless and it's time, I think, that we reaped the rewards.You may remember a few months ago I mentioned the Cool Futures Fund. As far as I know it's the world's only hedge fund geared to betting against the climate alarmist ""consensus"".When I helped crowdfund it in January by buying a share in its management company, I did so more than anything as a gesture of defiance. I wasn't altogether sure it would really get off the ground, nor that if it did it would make money - not with the Obama administration and its likely successor the Hillary Clinton administration pushing the green agenda so hard.But now I learn from one of its founders that the Fund is ready to launch early next year: they've done all their compliance and they're good to go - which leaves them pretty well placed, I imagine, to take advantage of the rebalancing of the global energy economy which Trump will undoubtedly effect.Here's their website if you're interested.Don't take my word for it: I have an appalling track record on financial affairs and anyway, I'm biased. I want the Fund to do well because I own one share in its management company and because apart from Trump in the White House I can think of few things more deliciously funny than seeing investors making money out of the hideous and painful and spectacular derailing of the green gravy train.Again, it's happening, it's really happening! The Green Citadel is falling. And I don't know about you but I'm not feeling in any particular rush to take prisoners... U.S. EPA employees were in tears. Worried Energy Department staffers were offered counseling. Some federal employees were so depressed, they took time off. Others might retire early.
And some employees are in downright panic mode in the aftermath of Donald Trump's victory.

For them, Stephen K. Bannon is the straw man of the hour.I can't think of anything stupider than the charge coming from all quarters of the left-including a headline in the pathetically wretched Huffington Post-that Bannon is an anti-Semite. The source? A one sentence claim from an angry ex-wife in divorce court no less, that Bannon didn't want their kids to go to school with Jews. I find that particularly amusing since Bannon wanted to make a film to celebrate this Jew's life.Not to be outdone, CNN, which has been particularly vicious, did a nasty attack on Bannon using another of the thinnest reeds available: This was a headline at Breitbart.com calling Bill Kristol a ""renegade Jew."" In fact, neither Breitbart nor Bannon is responsible for that statement. A Jew is. I wrote the article, which was neither requested nor commissioned by Breitbart. And I wrote the headline: ""Bill Kristol, Republican Spoiler, Renegade Jew.""I wrote the article when Kristol set out to lead the ""Never Trump"" movement, after Trump had secured the Republican nomination. I would write it again in a heartbeat. I would write it the same way and with the same headline. Bill Kristol and his friends betrayed the Republican Party, betrayed the American people, and betrayed the Jews when he set out to undermine Trump and elect the criminal Hillary Clinton. Obama and Hillary are supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood, the organization that launched the Arab drive to destroy Israel and push its Jews into the sea (that was their slogan).If Obama and Hillary had their way, Egypt's leader al-Sisi would be overthrown, the Brotherhood would be back in power, and Israel would be facing a threat from the biggest military power in the Middle East and almost  certainly at war with Islamic terrorists who openly call for the extermination of the Jews.I have known Steve Bannon for many years. This is a good man. He does not have an Anti-Semitic bone in his body. In his new position as Chief Strategist in the Trump White House, Bannon is the strongest assurance that people who love this country can have in America's future, the strongest assurance that America is in the hands of people who will give this country a chance to restore itself and defend itself against its enemies at home and abroad.SIGN UP"

Reports abounded of federal workers and nonprofit employees crying at their desks, scanning the web for out-of-town rentals or accepting the free hugs on offer in Farragut Square.Mr. Gray said he worried that a Trump administration could set the city back because the federal government still controls its purse strings and could enact abortion restrictions, cut vital investment and relax gun control laws.But Democrats now in the government and thinking of leaving it, and young people who had hopes of joining it, have a more immediate concern -- a job.Read the rest here.SIGN UP"

But the path to acquiring a suppressor is circuitous because the items are regulated under the auspices of the National Firearm Act (1934).This means acquisition of a suppressor requires finger prints, photographs of the purchaser, a background check, a $200 federal tax, and registration. Such regulations not only raises the price of suppressors but also increases the time it takes to purchase one.A waiting period of 4 to 6 months is not uncommon.Under President Trump this can change.  Donald Trump Jr. made this clear during a September 26 interview with SilencerCo, in which he said:I've had the privilege of being able to hunt in Europe, where some of the strictest gun laws in the world exist. And guess what, virtually every hunting gun there is suppressed. It's about safety. If you have that kind of noise levels in any of industry, like you do shooting sports, OSHA would be going crazy. It's about safety.Don Jr. went on to describe the regulation surrounding suppressors as ""just another rule the government wants to put in place for no reason."" He added, ""If Europe can do it, America better well be able to do it.""SilencerCo's CEO Joshua Waldron stated that ""it's crazy to be behind the curve"" on suppressors, when contrasted with Europe.

Adjacent to Bab al-Salam in Syria, it is a major conduit for traffic between opposition-held northern Syria and Turkey.Rebel officials described the fighting as a blow to the opposition in the Aleppo region. Many of the insurgent groups operating in the Azaz area also have a presence in eastern Aleppo, where rebel groups had also clashed on Nov 2.The Syrian army backed by Russian air strikes and Shi'ite militias including Lebanon's Hezbollah have been waging a fierce campaign against the insurgents in the city, before the war the country's most populous.MAJOR WEAKNESSRebel infighting has been a major weakness of the anti-Assad revolt since its earliest days. Rebel factions have been divided by both ideology and local power struggles.Jihadist groups have crushed less well-armed nationalist factions, while Islamists have also fought each other, notably in the Eastern Ghouta of Damascus this year.Sources on opposing sides of Monday's fighting gave different accounts of events.The Levant Front official described it as an attack on his group by rivals including the Nour al-Din al-Zinki faction,which also fights under the FSA banner but has coordinated closely with Islamist groups. He called the confrontation a potentially lethal blow to the rebellion.A source on the other side of the conflict said groups including Ahrar al-Sham and the Zinki group had launched a campaign to ""cleanse"" northern Syria of groups that were guilty of acting like gangs. A statement declaring the start of the campaign identified targets including the leader of the Levant Front and the head of its security office.Earlier this month, rebel factions clashed in eastern Aleppo itself. In that clash, the Zinki group and the allied jihadist Jabhat Fateh al-Sham tried to crush the Fastaqim faction, which is part of the FSA.Fateh al-Sham changed its name from the Nusra Front in July and said it was breaking its formal allegiance to al Qaeda. Officials from Ahrar al-Sham did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The Syrian army and its allies have completely encircled eastern Aleppo this year, and in September launched a major campaign aimed at seizing the insurgent-held areas.Rebels launched a counter attack last month, aimed at the city's government-held western districts. But that has failed, with the army and its allies on Saturday recapturing the last piece of territory they had lost.SIGN UP"

15	http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/11/13/democrats-divided-comeback-possible-trump-gop/	The Upside of the Downside for Dems: Their Party May Be Divided, But a Comeback Is Possible– What the Trump GOP Can Do About It 	"A few days ago, I wrote that the post-2016 ideological pendulum-swing within the Democratic Party makes it likely that President Donald Trump will face a weak Democratic challenger in 2020. And yet, as we shall see, over the long run, the news for the Democrats might improve -- thus Republicans must never grow complacent.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERYet of course, before the long run comes the short run, and that bodes poorly for the donkey party in the near term. As evidence of near-term trouble, in that earlier piece I cited the accelerating momentum behind the candidacy of Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN), a follower of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, to be the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Indeed, just in the last couple of days, the Ellison bandwagon seems to have grown into a juggernaut.So what's going on? If the Democrats were too far to the left in 2016, how will it help them to move even further leftward in 2017?What's fueling Ellison's candidacy, of course, is the anger of the Democratic grassroots. We can all see the images of street protests, even riots, and yet the printed words being tossed around are just as incendiary. To take an almost random example, we might pause over a screed from Neal Gabler, writing for BillMoyers.com. Gabler got right to the point: The problem is the voters and their ""incipient fascism."" Describing the 2016 balloting, Gabler declared:It turned out to be the hate election because, and let's not mince words, of the hatefulness of the electorate. In the years to come, we will brace for the violence, the anger, the racism, the misogyny, the xenophobia, the nativism, the white sense of grievance that will undoubtedly be unleashed now that we have destroyed the values that have bound us.So, according to Gabler, there you have it: The voters, at least the Trump voters, are judged to be racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, and nativist.We might pause to wonder: What is Gabler trying to accomplish here? Who thinks that such a slur-filled string of characterizations will inspire anyone to slap his or her forehead and say, ""Gee whiz, now that I've read Mr. Gabler's insults aimed at me, I'm starting to see things his way. So I'll vote Democratic from now on!"" Answer: Nobody.Gabler is just ranting, and yet his is one of many such rants flooding the Internet. But of course, these rants have their cumulative effect: Angry Democrats will become even angrier and even less persuasive to middle-of-the-road voters.Yet even as the Democrats' radicalization is off-putting to the country at large, it's probably necessary for Democratic politicos to accommodate this leftward shift. Why? Because when a wave hits, it's better to surf it than to drown in it.Of course, it hardly needs saying that a party that's poised to pick a hard-left Muslim such as Ellison as its national leader is no longer the party of such foursquare American icons as Andrew Jackson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Harry Truman.  Moreover, if the Democratic presidential nominee in 2020 is carrying Farrakhan baggage, he or she will be unelectable.So it might seem easy to conclude that the Democrats have a terminal problem. Indeed, the conventional wisdom about Democrats these days can be seen in these bleak words from Rolling Stone's Matt Taibbi:Now the Republicans are more dominant than ever, and it is the Democratic Party that is shattered and faces an uncertain future.Yes, as I have argued, we can foresee trouble in the next four years for the Democrats at the national level.That is, if the National Democrats, with or without Keith Ellison, choose to regard the voters with disdain, well, it's a safe bet that the voters will regard the National Democrats with disdain. A National Democrat, we can add, is one with ambitions to lead, help lead, or be an active part of, the entirety of the Democrat Party -- and all of its beliefs.However, not all elected Democrats are National Democrats. That is, across the 50 states, some Democrats -- maybe most -- are happy just plowing their own furrow in their own district or state. These are Local Democrats, and they tend to be more centrist. After all, out in, say, Indiana or Colorado, Democratic pols don't have to worry about the leftist influence of The New York Times because few, if any, of their constituents read the Times.So we can quickly see that a Local Democrat is, in a sense, liberated -- liberated, that is, from the increasingly ""progressive"" orthodoxies promulgated by the ideological spewtrons of NYC and DC.Okay, so let's get specific. Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, to name one, is a Local Democrat, not a National Democrat. To be sure, he's a member of the Democratic caucus within the U.S. Senate, and he votes with the Democrats more often than not, and yet still, he is always careful not to let himself be lumped in with the National Democrats.As a result of such distancing, Manchin has little or no influence on the National Democratic Party, but at least he has managed to keep his seat in the increasingly Republican Mountaineer State.As a reminder of Manchin's ""brand differentiation,"" we can recall his recent political spat with a National Democrat. After Sen. Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader, lashed out at Donald Trump in the nastiest possible terms, Manchin was quick to denounce Reid. As Manchin said in a statement, Reid was ""an absolute embarrassment to the Senate as an institution, our Democratic party, and the nation."" Given that Trump just won 69 percent of the vote in West Virginia, that was smart politics for Manchin, who is, in fact, up for re-election in 2018.So how will Reid and other Democrats react to a fellow Democrat attacking them? After all, if most Democrats, in and out of elective office, are working themselves into a frenzy of anti-Trumpism, what will they think of Manchin, who, in effect, was defending Trump?As a way of answering that question, here's something that Virgil has learned in his decades of watching intra-party squabbles: Sometimes the feud is real, and sometimes it's not.Sometimes, if Politician A calls out Politician B, hard feelings will arise, and perhaps A and B will find themselves embroiled in an all-out political rumble.However, sometimes the fight is a fake. That is, A bashes B, and B bashes back, and yet all the while, both are inwardly smiling, because the whole spectacle has been pre-arranged. That is, it's a show or a pageant aimed at making a point -- sort of like, say, pro wrestling. Indeed, at the end of the day, so to speak, A and B, their sharp words notwithstanding, might go off to have a drink together.And the purpose of such a pageant, of course, is politics -- re-election politics. As we have seen, Manchin did what he had to do: If Trump is wildly popular in his state, he is then well advised to defend Trump, sort of, when he is viciously attacked.And yet as we have also seen, Reid did what he had to do. Since the Democrats are in furious hate-mode against Trump, then Reid, as their leader, must give voice to their feelings. Okay, perhaps Reid got a little carried away in his nastiness, but then, he's always been a nasty guy, and Democrats don't seem to mind his overkill. Indeed, the Senate Dems -- including, at least until recently, Manchin -- have chosen Reid as their leader for the last dozen years.So it could be that Reid and Manchin are simply playing out their own little drama for the benefit of their respective audiences. That is, Reid thrills National Democrats by skewering Trump, and Manchin pleases the folks back in the hills and hollows by skewering Reid. In other words, it's a win-win.Okay, so here we can begin to see how the Democratic Party, having been cast into the wilderness, can begin its comeback.  The guiding principle is localism -- as Democratic legend Tip O'Neill liked to say, ""All politics is local."" And to apply this localism principle, we can offer this success formula: Different Democrats are well advised to react to the same event in different ways, according to the wishes of their different constituents -- different strokes for different Democrats. We can state this key point in another way: A shrewd politician can be compared to a chameleon; it helps to take on the coloration of the immediate environment. That is, be one color in one place, be another color in another place. As chameleons know, that's the best mechanism for survival.Thus we can see, for example, that if Manchin had spent the last year blasting Trump, he'd be a goner in the '18 election. To be sure, it's possible that West Virginia is now so Republican that Manchin will lose in two years just because he carries the ""D"" label, but perhaps he could change that coloring, too -- he could switch parties.Okay, so that's how an individual Democratic politician survives in a tough environment -- by blending into the local landscape. And over time, if enough Democrats learn to play the Manchin game -- nobody here but us Locals! -- in other red states, it's possible that they could score enough victories to add up to a collective comeback for the Democrats.Yet now we come to a paradoxical reality: Yes, it's true, on the one hand, that members of a party must learn to adapt to local conditions. And yet it's also true, on the other hand, that members of a party must stick together, even if they choose to keep each other at a safe distance.That is, for the sake of its own health, a party is generally well-advised to be loose, more like a confederation than a tightly unified body. In other words, for their sake as a party, the Democrats are stronger if they can find room for both Joe Manchin and Harry Reid.Indeed, the one thing that a party can not survive is an outright split, a division into two parties, in which the breakaway party actually runs candidates against the old party. And in fact, just such a split is being talked about in activist circles today. Robert Reich, the former secretary of labor and a longtime fixture on the left, is outright threatening the formation of a third party:This has been a huge refutation of establishment politics, and the political organization has got to be changed... If the Democratic Party can't do it, we'll do it through a third party.Obviously the creation of a new left-wing third party -- or a sudden mass exodus to, say, the Green Party -- would be disastrous for the Democrats.We can recall that the last major split in the U.S. partisan alignment was in 1912; in that year, progressive Republicans, led by former president Theodore Roosevelt, broke off from the regular Republicans, led by President William Howard Taft. As a result of that fracture, both Roosevelt and Taft were swamped in November by Woodrow Wilson, who was leading a united Democratic Party. After that stark lesson in the perils of dividedness, American parties have been more effective at holding themselves together.Yet still, intra-party fractures still happen in Western democracies, and they always end in tears for those fractured. For example, after Margaret Thatcher, a Conservative, was elected as prime minister of the United Kingdom in 1979, the opposition Labour Party found itself split along ideological lines -- moderate left vs. hard left. As a result of that split, Labour didn't win another national election for two decades.Returning to the here and now, it's probably the fear of just that sort of catastrophic cleavage that has inspired so many top Democrats -- including Sen. Chuck Schumer, who will replace the retiring Harry Reid as Democratic leader next year -- to get behind the DNC candidacy of Keith Ellison.Sure, Ellison is a radical, and anti-Israel to boot-- and that must be personally painful to Schumer and to many of his New York constituents -- but, nonetheless, for the sake of his party's unity, Schumer must recognize that Ellison amply represents the angry mood of the Democrats. So for now, at least, inside the party, Ellison is the best bet. The moral of this cynical story: There's a fine line between ""leading"" and ""following"" -- sometimes, a wily pol must do both.Yes, of course, Ellison's style of radical left-wing politics won't help Democrats win back the White House in four years, but most Democrats aren't planning to run for president -- ever.In the meantime, Ellison's ascension to the DNC chairmanship could solve a more immediate concern -- holding the Democratic Party together in the next few months. That is, keeping radical left-wingers, still irate over the treatment of their man Bernie Sanders, from going indie. Once again: sticking together is the sine qua non (without which, nothing) of party politics.And then, with their unity preserved, the Democrats can get back to figuring out how to get their power back -- at least some of it.And here's where the Democrats will, in fact, have a chance to bounce back. You see, there's something of an inverse relationship between control of the White House and control of the Congress. In fact, it's close to an ""iron law"": The Party in the White House almost always -- not always, but almost always -- loses seats in Congress during its White House tenure.And why is this the case? Because, in midterm elections, where overall turnout is smaller than in presidential years, the ""anti"" vote tends to loom larger as a proportionate share in midterms. In fact, history tells us that there's always something for voters to be ""anti"" about. That is, even for a citizen who voted in favor of the incumbent president, it's still easy to become irked at the party in the White House over something. And it's equally easy to take out that anger by voting against the president's party in the midterm elections -- or perhaps not voting at all. Thus it is that the presidential party's Congressional strength is almost always chipped away during the course of its time in the White House.We can observe this phenomenon in our own recent political history: In 1952, Republican Dwight Eisenhower's won a landslide presidential victory. And in that election, he carried many other Republicans into office on his ""coattails."" And so it was in the 83rd Congress, convening in January 1953, that Republicans had 221 Republicans in the House, forming a slim three-seat majority. And in the Senate, Republicans had 48 seats; with Vice President Nixon as the tie breaker, they thus had the slimmest possible majority in that then-96-seat chamber. Then, of course, four years later, in 1956, Eisenhower was thunderously re-elected.Yet even so, Ike and his party weren't universally popular; even Republicans, at times, were disgruntled over one thing or another -- and so the GOP suffered in the midterm elections. In the 1954 balloting, even as the 34th president was riding high, the party lost control of both legislative chambers.In fact, by the end of Ike's presidency, Congressional Republicans had suffered a serious hemorrhage. After that painful midterm election in 1954, and the even more painful midterm in 1958, Republicans were reduced to a rump minority; in the 87th Congress, which convened in January 1961, Republican strength had ebbed to just 173 Members in the House, and 35 in the Senate.We can also note that the same attrition of Congressional strength happened to the Democrats when they held the White House from 1961 to 1969 -- and then to the Republicans from 1969 to 1977, then to the Democrats from 1977 to 1981, and on and on.We can look at this inverse relationship another way: Beginning in 1952, the Democrats fell into a ditch in terms of winning the presidency; in fact, they lost seven of ten presidential elections from 1952 to 1988.Obviously, from a Democrats' perspective, this presidential dearth wasn't a good thing, but there was a silver lining: During that 40-year period, even as they were mostly losing the White House, Dems controlled the House for 38 years, and the Senate for 32 years.Then more recently, the situation reversed: In the six presidential elections from 1992 to 2016, the Democrats won four contests, and yet during that same 24-year span, they controlled the House only for six years and the Senate for only eight years.So we can see: Control of the White House and control of Capitol Hill have a way of moving in opposite directions; the voters seem to prefer divided government.So does Donald Trump's victory portend hard times for Republicans in Congress? Perhaps.And yet it doesn't have to be that way. We'll explore possible alternatives in future installments of this series.###This article is the first in a series. Next: How parties have maintained their power -- all of it. And how the Trump Republicans can do it again.It turned out to be the hate election because, and let's not mince words, of the hatefulness of the electorate.

Leslie Stahl broached the subject by bringing up abortion. She asked, ""Will you appoint- are you looking to appoint a justice who wants to overturn Roe v. Wade?""Trump said his nominees will be ""pro-life."" So Stahl pressed harder, and Trump said:Well, there are a couple of things. They'll be pro-life, they'll be-in terms of the whole gun situation, we know the Second Amendment and everybody's talking about the Second Amendment and they're trying to dice it up and change it, they're going to be very pro-Second Amendment. But having to do with abortion if it ever were overturned, it would go back to the states.This answer is congruent with Trump's campaign pledges to appoint justices to the Supreme Court ""in the mold of Justice Scalia."" On October 9, Trump said his Supreme Court nominees would be ""People that will respect the constitution of the United States. And I think that this is so important.""Numerous times during the campaign, Trump pledged to stand with the NRA and ""save the Second Amendment."" And on April 11, 2015-just when the Republican primary nominees were beginning to emerge-Trump stressed the importance of not only preserving the Second Amendment but preserving it in its ""strongest form.""He said:It is so important that we maintain the Second Amendment and that we maintain it strongly. And one of the main reasons is because the good people, the upstanding people, follow laws and norms, but the bad ones don't. So if the Second Amendment weren't there to protect our rights and someone tampered with them, the good people would be affected but the bad people wouldn't care-they couldn't care less.It is absolutely imperative that we maintain the Second Amendment in its strongest form.Now, as President-elect, he is telling 60 Minutes that he plans to do exactly what he said.

That's three out of four Americans.Of that 74 percent, 58 percent ""strongly"" support the legitimacy of the election, and 16 percent ""somewhat"" support the election. Five percent ""somewhat"" believe the election is illegitimate.The 14 percent who strongly believe the election is illegitimate is only one-in-seven Americans, but that is to launch a major political campaign against Trump. The 14 percent is higher than the 11 percent who said they would never accept George W. Bush's contested election in 2000, according to Gallup.Nationwide, Democrats and their allies in the media and entertainment industries are encouraging mass protests against President-elect Trump.On Nov. 9, for example, President Barack Obama admonished his supporters to keep fighting: ""To the young people who got into politics for the first time, and may be disappointed by the results, I just want you to know, you have to stay encouraged. Don't get cynical. Don't ever think you can't make a difference. As Secretary Clinton said this morning, fighting for what is right is worth it.""Hillary Clinton told her supporters to keep fighting.Our constitutional democracy demands our participation, not just every four years, but all the time. So let's do all we can to keep advancing the causes and values we all hold dear. Making our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top, protecting our country and protecting our planet, and breaking down all the barriers that hold any American back from achieving their dreams.We have spent a year and a half bringing together millions of people from every corner of our country to say with one voice that we believe that the American dream is big enough for everyone, for people of all races and religions, for men and women, for immigrants, for LGBT people and for people with disabilities.

I am so grateful to stand with all of you... so we need -- we need you to keep up these fights now and for the rest of your lives.Since then, progressives have been organizing marches against Trump, while their allies in business and the entertainment sectors also complain about the election. On Nov. 12, for example, Kate McKinnon, a comedian working for ""Saturday Night Live,"" told her audience Nov. 12 that ""I'm not giving up, and neither should you.""The complaints are accompanied by riots and by attacks on Americans, including children and adults.In Chicago for example, David Wilcox was attacked and his car was stolen by a group of Democratic supporters. ""What's happening to America?"" said Wilcox told a Chicago Tribune's news crew. ""You're supposed to be able to vote in peace! It's supposed to be part of our democracy. And what happened is, I vote for somebody, and I get beaten, robbed, and my car stolen, and I have no way of getting my wife to and from work safe anymore,"" he said.David Wilcox, ChicagoThe poll of 665 Americans can be read here.

Ryan, he said, also had ""a plan to cut Americans' hard-earned benefits"" that voters rejected.But Ryan backed off immigration reform when conservatives rejected the ""Gang of Eight"" bill, and free trade deals are no longer on the agenda, for better or for worse, now that Trump's election victory has prompted President Barack Obama to pull the plug on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).Martin is correct to point out an apparent tension between Ryan and Trump on the question of entitlement reform. Trump campaigned across the nation on a promise to protect Social Security. ""You made a deal a long time ago,"" he told Iowa voters on the Sunday before Election Day.Yet Ryan's plans for Social Security and Medicare reform both preserve the current system for people age 55 and over. They would apply to younger people, making Social Security more like the savings program that many people (wrongly) assume it already is, and moving Medicare towards a model of individual insurance.The proposals Ryan made as chair of the House Budget Committee to tackle the deficit and the debt were among the reasons conservatives cheered his nomination as Mitt Romney's running mate in 2012. Those plans are even more relevant today.In every area other than trade and immigration, Ryan's policies line up with Trump's policies. The remaining tensions on entitlement reform, and the details of specific tax policies, could be the subject of productive negotiation between the White House and Congress.Ryan made several political stumbles during the election, fearful that media scandals around Trump's rhetorical blunders would translate into losses for the party as a whole. But Trump overcame those obstacles and had political ""coattails,"" helping the GOP hold both the House and the Senate.Conservatives should give Ryan a chance to show what he is capable of achieving when he is finally able to pass legislation. He could help Trump make his first 100 days among the most consequential of any president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt.This is the opportunity for which the Tea Party campaigned, and which the country desperately needs.

Another 370 who came to Australia for medical treatment then refused to return to the islands would also be eligible.""We deal with one administration at a time and there is only one president of the United States at a time,"" Turnbull told reporters.Trump has called for a moratorium or tight restrictions on Muslim immigration. Most of the asylum seekers are Muslims from the Middle East, Africa and Asia.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry confirmed that the United States had ""agreed to consider referrals"" from the United Nations refugee agency on Australia's refugees.""We are going to work to protect vulnerable refugees around the world, and we'll share that responsibility with our friends in the regions that are most affected by this challenge,"" Kerry told reporters in New Zealand.Australia refuses to resettle any refugee who has arrived by boat since the date the tough policy was announced on July 19, 2013.Australia pays Nauru and Papua New Guinea to house boat arrivals and has been searching for countries that will resettle them.Few refugees have accepted offers to resettle in Papua New Guinea and Cambodia because most hope that Australia will eventually take them in.Any refugee who refuses to go to the U.S. would be given a 20-year visa to stay on Nauru, a tiny impoverished atoll with a population of 10,000 people, Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said.U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials are expected in Australia this week to begin assessing refugees.Turnbull would not say how many refugees the United States might take, but said the most vulnerable would be given priority.""Our priority is the resettlement of woman, children and families,"" Turnbull said. ""This will be an orderly process. It will take time. It will not be rushed.""Refugees who arrive in the future would not be sent to the United States, he said.""We anticipate that people smugglers will seek to use this agreement as a marketing opportunity to tempt vulnerable people onto these perilous sea journeys,"" Turnbull said. ""We have put in place the largest and most capable maritime surveillance and response fleet Australia has ever deployed.""Australian Border Force Commissioner Roman Quaedvlieg said ships had been positioned to turn boats back to Indonesia if asylum seekers attempt to reach Australia in the hope of being sent to the U.S.No people smuggling operation has successfully delivered asylum seekers to Australia by boat since July 2014.Turnbull announced at Obama's Leaders' Summit on Refugees in September that Australia would participate in the U.S.-led program to resettle Central American refugees from a camp in Costa Rica. Australia would also increase its refugee intake by 5,000 to 18,750 a year.Turnbull said at the time that the agreement to resettle Hondurans and El Salvadoreans was ""not linked to any other resettlement discussions"" involving Australia's refugees getting to the U.S.Refugee Action Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul said some refugees on Nauru were ""hopeful"" of resettlement in the United States, but were frustrated by the lack of detail. There seemed no short-term hope for asylum seekers on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island, a male-only camp holding 873 men.""There are some people who if the United States is offered to them, certainly they will take it,"" Rintoul said, adding that several would prefer Australia where they had family.Rights groups have been scathing about conditions on the island immigration camps. Two asylum seekers set themselves on fire on Nauru this year and two local men have been convicted of murdering an Iranian asylum seeker during a 2004 riot at the Manus Island camp.___Associated Press writer Nick Perry in Wellington, New Zealand, contributed to this report.SIGN UP"

Agents are being reallocated to assist with a growing surge of immigrants from Mexico and Central America.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBorder Patrol officials in the Rio Grande Valley (RGV) Sector announced that 150 agents will be temporarily be transferred from the Tucson, San Diego, and Del Rio Sectors to the McAllen and Weslaco Centralized Processing Centers. Their duty will be to increase the screening and processing of the unauthorized immigrants with a focus on UACs (unaccompanied Alien Children) and FMUAs (Family Unit Aliens), according to information obtained from Supervisory Border Patrol Agent Marlene Castro by Breitbart Texas.The move amounts to ""robbing Peter to pay Paul"" as officials take agents off the line from sectors with their own immigrant surges.The sectors are being robbed of agents are having their own surge of illegal immigrants as Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials try to make it look like they are doing something in response to the renewed humanitarian crisis along the southern border. The San Diego Sector reported an increase in FMUA apprehensions of 303 percent when comparing FY 2016 and FY 2107 numbers. UAC apprehensions also increased, by 71 percent over the same time period last year. Breitbart Texas reported on October 22 that the San Diego Sector was also dealing with a 600 percent increase of Haitian refugees comparing FY 2016 to the previous year.The Tucson Sector, from where agents are being moved to Texas, also saw an increase in FMUA apprehensions of 17 percent comparing October 2016 to October 2017. Fortunately, UAC apprehensions were down for the month.The Del Rio Sector saw a 51 percent increase in FMUA apprehensions during this same comparison period while UAC apprehensions dropped by only five percent.Several Border Patrol agents have expressed their frustration at being used as ""babysitters"" to Breitbart Texas. They stated that Mexican cartels have learned they can tie up Border Patrol agents by flooding a region with these children, mostly from Central America. They are then free to move their drug cargo and other ""higher value"" human cargo through other locations.""The smugglers learned in 2014 that they could tie up Border Patrol agents as babysitters and keep us from our primary mission of stopping illegal border crossings and drug smuggling,"" U.S. Border Patrol Agent Chris Cabrera told Breitbart Texas in his capacity as president of National Border Patrol Council Local 3307 in an interview on October 26.

That decision reaffirmed that the right to keep and bear arms was an individual right.Trump's platform was the complete opposite of Clinton's. In fact, during the October 9 presidential debate Trump said he was going save the Second Amendment from ""people like Hillary Clinton.""So the choice was clear-a vote for Clinton was a vote for gun control and a vote for Trump was a vote to defend gun rights from further government intrusion and regulation. Or, as the NRA put it, ""Simply put, gun control was on the ballot this election season, and it suffered a resounding loss.""Simply put, #guncontrol was on the ballot this election season, and it suffered a resounding loss https://t.co/OSC83kI2sb #2A-- NRA (@NRA) November 11, 2016And the NRA observes that gun control's defeat reaffirms the strength NRA members possess when they rally to the cause:Once again, #NRA's members and supporters proved to be the most potent political force in America https://t.co/mVI2e20kK6 #2A-- NRA (@NRA) November 11, 2016AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of ""Bullets with AWR Hawkins,"" a Breitbart News podcast.

[Clinton supports] more comprehensive background checks, repealing the gun industry's immunity from lawsuits for negligence, revoking the licenses of gun dealers that knowingly supply weapons to straw purchasers and gun traffickers, and toughening laws and regulations to prevent domestic abusers and the mentally ill from obtaining guns. She also calls for a renewal of the assault-weapons ban.
