What's more, she far surpassed Obama's 2012 vote total in Florida, the country's biggest swing state. Yet somehow, while Obama carried Florida, Clinton lost it.Which brings us to an important question: Was Donald Trump just good enough to beat a bad Democratic opponent on Tuesday, or does he deserve far more credit?

He used a policy position paper to explain that national reciprocity needs to succeed, saying:The right of self-defense doesn't stop at the end of your driveway. That's why I have a concealed carry permit and why tens of millions of Americans do too. That permit should be valid in all 50 states. A driver's license works in every state, so it's common sense that a concealed carry permit should work in every state. If we can do that for driving - which is a privilege, not a right - then surely we can do that for concealed carry, which is a right, not a privilege.Trump's support for national reciprocity coincides with HR 923; a national reciprocity push from Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) and Representative Marlin Stutzman (R-IN-3rd). The push is a major facet of Gun Owners of America's (GOA) plan not simply to hold ground, but to expand the territory held.Breitbart News previously talked with GOA executive director Erich Pratt about HR 923, and he said:Concealed carry reciprocity legislation could begin moving in Congress real soon. So it's important for gun owners to contact their representatives and urge them to co-sponsor HR 923, the measure which establishes reciprocity and safeguards Constitutional Carry.Gun owners shouldn't have to ask for permission to exercise their constitutionally protected rights. And that's the beauty of HR 923. If it passes, all concealed carriers -- even those from permitless carry states -- will not have to fear prosecution when traveling with firearms from coast-to-coast.The idea that ""gun owners shouldn't have to ask permission to exercise their constitutionally protected rights"" perfectly aligns with Trump's assessment that ""concealed carry...is a right, not a privilege."" And it serves to level the playing field between law-abiding citizens and criminals by drastically reducing the number of places/states in which citizens must walk about unarmed, therefore defenseless.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of ""Bullets with AWR Hawkins,"" a Breitbart News podcast.

Ayotte by 1,437 Votes; Recount Looms as Ayotte Does Not Concede	"The Democratic governor of New Hampshire declared victory shortly before noon Wednesday in her challenge to unseat Sen. Kelly Ayotte in the closest Senate race in the 2016 election cycle.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""It will be my job in the U.S. Senate to make the best decisions for New Hampshire to work with President-elect Trump when it is in the best interest of New Hampshire and the country, and to stand up to him when it isn't,"" said Gov. Maggie Hassan, who ran as future partner to her party's nominee for president Hillary R. Clinton-while Ayotte struggled to describe her own place in relation to Trump, her party's nominee.""As you all know, I entered public service as an advocate for people who experience disabilities,"" she said. ""People whose voices are too often not heard. I believe we are stronger when we listen to all voices and all perspectives. We are stronger when we are working to ensure that every person has the opportunity to share in our nation's success.""The governor declared victory before the final ballots were counted and without a concession from the Ayotte campaign, whose spokeswoman offered this statement:""This has been a closely contested race from the beginning, and we look forward to results being announced by the Secretary of State, and ensuring that every vote is counted in this race that has received an historic level of interest.""The New Hampshire Secretary of State certified 100 percent of the state's ballots counted, giving Hassan the nod over Ayotte by 1,023 votes.Clinton beat Trump by 1.437 votes in the battle for the state's four electoral votes.In an Oct. 3 debate with Hassan, Ayotte said she thought Trump was a role model for children, but soon walked it back: """"I corrected that because I made a mistake. I mean debates many people are -- you're asked a lot of questions at a debate. But it's clear to me that neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton, unfortunately, are role models.""In her final construct, the former state attorney general said: ""I will stand up to Donald Trump, but I will vote for him.""The senator never campaigned with Trump.Ayotte was a distant third in the GOP primary for Senate in 2010, when she was plucked up by Sarah Palin, who called her a ""mama-grizzly"" and made her the front runner. In those days, Ayotte campaigned as a member of the Tea Party and disciple of Palin. But, over time in Washington, Ayotte drifted away from her mentress, who in 2013 denounced Ayotte for supporting the ""Gang of Eight"" amnesty bill for illegal aliens.When Capitol Hill conservatives forced the partial shutdown of the federal government in September-October 2013, the senator joined with Democrats to undercut conservatives.New Hampshire law allows candidates to request a recount if the deciding margin is at least 20 percent of the votes cast.SIGN UP"
5	http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/11/09/exclusive-sarah-palin-michigan-finally-went-rogue/	EXCLUSIVE — Sarah Palin: Michigan Finally Went Rogue	"Flipping Michigan red is huge. It had been a blue state since 1988, so it was thrilling to see the numbers today. They deserve the best.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERMichigan really can be the ""Comeback State."" I told people at my recent rallies there that they are blessed with every element of a perfectly positive storm that could, finally, rev up their state's economy like they deserve: the natural resources, the industrial infrastructure, and most importantly the manpower and work ethic. And now, finally, Michigan has chosen a pro-private sector presidential candidate who knows how to create jobs.I've felt this way about Michigan for many years, including in 2008 when the McCain/Palin campaign staffers shocked us with unexpected news that the campaign was pulling out of the Great Lakes State.I remember my jaw dropped when I was asked on the air what I thought about us ""giving up"" on Michigan. I believe it was FOX News' ""Campaign Carl"" Cameron who caught me like a Michigan deer in the headlights, asking me that question. The campaign had forgotten to give me the memo evidently.I remember candidly responding something like, ""What? We're not going to Michigan? Why? Every vote counts!"" It was a rotten decision to bail on Michigan.That night our small ""JV Team"" (they called the VP campaign the ""B Team"" or ""JV'ers"") had a better idea than that A-Team, which seemed to be giving up on not only Michigan but the entire campaign at that point.The campaign was just going to land at a hotel on the road anyway that night, so we decided we'd rent a car and zip to Michigan instead of sleeping. We'd campaign there on our own and show Michigan some love and respect, then zip back to make it in time for our next rally. We'd ask for forgiveness later.I figured the A-Team would never be the wiser because some of them didn't know what their own plans looked like, much less what a good plan looked like.Somebody leaked our plan, then someone told someone else at ""headquarters"" (we ask each other still today where ""headquarters"" was) that whomever was driving the rental car would be arrested if we ""went rogue"" and drove over the state border, and that I'd better never think of ""going rogue"" again. What a day. It pretty much changed my life.The whole Michigan experience empowered many of us because we knew that to disrespect a state in our union -- when professional politicos had nothing better planned anyway that night -- was disrespecting the hardworking patriots who weren't asking much of their government; they just wanted opportunity to work.After that day the ""she's going rogue"" mantra stuck, especially every time I spoke candidly and ignored the TelePrompTer. I wrote the bestseller Going Rogue with Michigan as an inspiration.So, watching those Trump numbers come in from Michigan -- knowing it was a key state to flip for victory and, more importantly, knowing that Michigan deserves her turn at prosperity again -- was an answer to prayer.Those Michigan Independents, Republicans and good Reagan Democrats, who know the political status quo has to go, put their faith in the GOP ticket. They're putting faith in those they elect to not jump off the planks in the America First platform. They cannot be let down again.The whole nation is pulling for the once robust industrial cities like Detroit. We want to buy American-made everything. And once government gets off our back and gets back on our side, we can do it.At a recent Trump rally in Michigan, I told the crowd that Hillary's decision to play the woman card wouldn't work in Michigan. Voting her the first woman president wasn't going to happen, not because of sexism, but because she's out of touch. She admitted that she hasn't driven a vehicle in decades.I said, ""I want the first woman president to be connected to the people and to at least have driven a car lately. Heck, better yet -- I want our first woman president to drive a truck. Made in Detroit!""SIGN UP"

That was an improvement from 2012 Republican presidential nominee former Gov. Mitt Romney's effort of 47 percent, according to the Miami Herald.South Florida Turnout Underperformed Compared Statewide Average: If Hillary was going to win Florida on election night, she needed a tremendous get-out-the-vote effort in the south Florida Democratic strongholds of Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach Counties.While turnout was over 74 percent across Florida, turnout in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach Counties was at 72 percent, 70 percent and 74 percent respectively.Late in the afternoon on Election Day, Trump and his surrogates expressed concern that turnout in Panhandle counties was light and that it could lessen his chances. Turnout was lower than the Trump campaign had hoped for in the far western Escambia County - where Trump hosted two rallies in the run up to Election Day -- at 73 percent.Bay and Okaloosa Counties, two other major populated counties in the heavily Republican panhandle, exceeded turnout at 74 percent and 75 percent, respectively. Santa Rosa County, however, far underperformed with only 67 percent turnout.Suburban Voters Won the I-4 Corridor for TrumpNearly every presidential election cycle, pundits focus on swing voters in Florida's I-4 corridor, which runs from the Tampa-St. Petersburg area, northeast through Orlando and up to Daytona Beach on the state's eastern coast.Dr. Susan MacManus, a political science professor at Tampa's University of South Florida, attributed Trump's I-4 corridor success to suburban vote, saying it was enough to win the day over the Democratic-leaning precincts in the urban centers of Tampa and Orlando.""The suburban vote was much heavier than usual,"" MacManus said to Tampa ABC affiliate WFTS on Wednesday. ""It's how Donald Trump won the I-4 corridor 51-45 percent.""Hillsborough County Is No Longer the Bellwether: Late in the campaign, Donald Trump brought big crowds to the MidFlorida Amphitheatre and the Florida State Fairgrounds in Tampa. But it wasn't enough to give him Hillsborough County, home to Tampa.As went Hillsborough County, so went the country in the past four presidential elections, but that trend ended Tuesday night when Clinton won the county by 40,000 votes. Trump, however, did manage to flip nearby Pinellas County, home to St. Petersburg with a victory of over 5,000 votes. Pinellas had gone Democrat in three of the last four elections, the exception being the 2004 contest between George W. Bush and John Kerry.No Down-Ballot Trump Effect on Marco RubioSen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) cruised to an easy win over his Democratic opponent Rep. Patrick Murphy (D-FL) for reelection.Rubio's race was called much earlier than Florida was for Trump.As of Wednesday afternoon, Trump's margin of victory was nearly 120,000 votes. Rubio's margin of victory over Murphy was nearly 717,000. Overall, there were 200,000 voters that voted for Rubio that did not vote for Trump.Almost immediately after announcing his candidacy for U.S. Senate after dropping out of the presidential race through Election Day, Rubio maintained a lead in polling over Murphy.Rubio never fully embraced Trump's candidacy, despite endorsing him as the GOP nominee. Murphy attempted on numerous occasions to tie him to Trump, but in the end it had no effect.Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poorSIGN UP"

Except for a relative handful of wealthy and connected people, nobody actually wanted to vote for her.She is the most corrupt, compromised, dishonest, self-dealing, delusional and unlikeable candidate perhaps to ever run for president.I used to wonder why President Obama would want to hand his legacy over to such fake and felonious monster. Then I realized that he doesn't really care about anything but himself and for as long as she is around, people will miss him.Anyway, Mrs. Clinton's campaign was about everything and anything and, in the end, nothing.In her closing ad, played to the tune of a famous pop song, ""supporters"" declared they were voting for ""equality,"" ""respect,"" ""courage,"" ""community,"" ""fairness"" and a bunch of other gobbledygook. The only thing nobody said they were voting for: Hillary Clinton.Some voted for her because she was not Donald Trump. Others voted for her because, as Democrats, they are part of a grand corrupt compromise that brings together all the various grievous factions that make up the Democratic Party.But the glue that keeps this aging syndicate from fracturing into all-out war is thinning. How long can Black Lives Matter race-baiters work in cahoots with the United Steelworkers Union?That glue almost came apart in the insurgent campaign of Bernard Sanders. But, thanks to the corrupt conspiracy inside the Democratic National Committee, that revolt was put down.In the Republican revolution, Mr. Trump gave voice to voters who have been ignored by GOP leaders for decades. He gave them a voice and together they changed the party's stance on immigration, trade, economics, national security and globalism.He uprooted and altered the very language the party spoke. The whispered tiptoeing of political correctness was slain.The same revolution that exploded the Republican Party this year is still boiling inside the Democratic Party. Eventually, it will explode. And the longer it seethes, the more devastating the explosion will be.Welcome, Democrats, to the revolution.* Charles Hurt can be reached at charleshurt@live.com; follow him on Twitter via @charleshurt.SIGN UP"

""We made a promise to each other to not discuss it while we were in church because there was so much tension.""With the election behind them, Milton and her fellow parishioners are getting ready to give away food for Thanksgiving.

It would have also forced law-abiding citizens to pay a fee for the background check, effectively taxing them for loaning a gun to a friend.Question 3 was sponsored by Michael Bloomberg-funded Everytown for Gun Safety, and WCSH 6 reports that it ""failed"" to pass.According to the Bangor Daily News, ""By any measure, it's a stunning victory for what David Trahan, the executive director of the Sportsman's Alliance of Maine, called a group of 'ragtag volunteers.'"" It's a victory that proves ""you can win on an issue without money ... at the grass-roots level.""Franklin County Sheriff Scott Nichols also fought against Question 3. He appeared in a television ad, where he stressed that ""background checks are 'already' [the] law and that [an expansion] wouldn't stop criminals, but it would rather create them out of otherwise law-abiding Mainers."" In other words, background checks for retail sales have been the law of the land since 1998, and expanding those checks to private sales would only criminalize law-abiding Mainers who refused to comply with new fee requirements and more government oversight on gun sales.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of ""Bullets with AWR Hawkins,"" a Breitbart News podcast.

""And then, only then, would you dismantle what's in place.""Carson declined to say whether he was being considered for a Cabinet position, but Politico reports that his name is being floated as a possible candidate for positions such as secretary of health and human services or secretary of education.Trump campaigned on replacing Obamacare with a simpler, cheaper alternative that has less government regulation.A GOP-led Congress means that a Trump administration would have the best chance of coming up with an alternative to Obamacare since 2010 passage of the law.Carson entered the spotlight at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast when he criticized President Obama over his signature healthcare law.Carson ran against Trump in the primary only to drop out and endorse him in March.Carson said Wednesday that Trump would win over his critics with his leadership on issues like Obamacare.""I think actually a lot of people who have tried to demonize him will be quite shocked when they see who he really is,"" he said.

But conciliatory comments from the president-elect helped global stock markets recover a large chunk of their earlier losses.On Wall Street, financial companies led the gainers, surging 3.2 percent. Banks and other financial stocks tend to benefit from higher interest rates and less government regulation, two things investors anticipate could happen during a Trump presidency.Health care stocks were also heading sharply higher. Traders had feared Clinton would implement curbs on drug pricing increases that could hurt drugmakers and biotechnology companies.Utilities were down the most, sliding 2.6 percent, followed closely by consumer-focused stocks. Crude oil prices headed higher after being down earlier in the day.The Dow Jones industrial average was up 171 points, or 0.9 percent, to 18,504 as of 1:05 p.m. Eastern Time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 17 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,157. The Nasdaq composite index rose 38 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,232.A sell-off in bonds sent prices tumbling, driving the yield on the 10-year Treasury note up to 2.04 percent from 1.86 percent late Tuesday, a large move. That's the highest the rate has been since January. That rate is a benchmark used to set interest rates on many kinds of loans including home mortgages.Traders are selling bonds to hedge against the possibility that interest rates, which have been ultra-low for years, could rise steadily again under a Trump administration, said Tom di Galoma, managing director of trading at Seaport Global Securities.""People are starting to believe that Donald Trump is good for the economy, which makes him not so good for the bond market,"" di Galoma said. ""You've also had the stock market come back overnight. People are starting to realize that a Trump presidency is not the end of the world.""Though uncertainty remains over Trump's trade, immigration and geopolitical policies and what his victory means for the future of globalization, investors appeared somewhat calmed by his victory speech, in which he praised Clinton and urged Americans to ""come together as one united people"" after a divisive campaign.""While Trump slightly soothed some concerns in his victory speech, uncertainty remains over what kind of a U.S. he plans to lead,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA.Health care companies like hospital chains and some insurers that gained business from the Affordable Care Act's coverage expansion took heavy losses. Meanwhile, shares jumped for drugmakers and pharmacy benefits managers that likely will face less regulatory scrutiny over price increases from a Trump administration.HCA, the nation's largest hospital chain, was down nearly 15 percent, while Viagra maker Pfizer climbed more than 7 percent, the biggest gain in the Dow. The biggest pharmacy benefits manager, Express Scripts Holding Co., was up more than 6 percent.Traders also bid up shares in defense contractors, anticipating the companies will thrive under a Trump presidency. Northrop Grumman climbed 5.1 percent, while Lockheed Martin rose 5.7 percent. Raytheon added 7.1 percent.Private prison operators also surged. Corrections Corp. of America vaulted 47 percent, while GEO Group jumped 20.1 percent.Firearm sales typically surge when a presidential candidate who favors an expansion of gun-control laws is elected. That's not the case with Trump, however. That gave investors a reason to sell shares in firearm makers. Smith & Wesson slid 14.4 percent, while Sturm, Ruger & Co.., fell 13.7 percent.In Europe, Germany's DAX was up 1.6 percent, while France's CAC-40 gained 1.5 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was 1 percent higher.As Trump gained the lead in the electoral vote count, share prices tumbled in Asia, which were open during the election results.By the time Trump was confirmed the winner and made his speech, financial markets had steadied. The dollar also recouped some ground, while assets that many investors search out at times of uncertainty, such as gold, came off earlier highs.One currency that remained heavily sold is the Mexican peso. It was down 8.4 percent as the prospect of a wall along the United States' southern border, a key campaigning point for Trump, has come one step closer to reality. Trump has insisted that Mexico will pay for the wall. The U.S. currency rose sharply to 19.75 Mexican pesos from 18.68 pesos.Also potentially impacting the peso is Trump's threat to rip up trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement, a key plank in Mexico's economic strategy and growth.""If Trump is able to follow through with these suggestions, Mexican activity will suffer greatly,"" said Jane Foley, senior foreign exchange strategist at Rabobank International.Trump doesn't formally take the reins of power until January but he will begin the transition to his presidency almost immediately. In the coming weeks, investors will be looking to see if he further tempers some of the rhetoric that polarized American opinion and often spooked investors in financial markets.Another point of interest will center on the U.S.'s trade relations with China and its impact across Asia. Trump's victory has raised concerns that the U.S. and China might embark on a trade war of sorts and that protectionism around the world will grow.Those concerns weighed heavily on Asian stocks. Japan's Nikkei 225 index closed 5.4 percent lower, recouping some losses. Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed 2.2 percent lower.SIGN UP"

Darrell Issa Narrowly Holds on to Seat in California	"SAN DIEGO, California -- Republican Rep. Darrell Issa retains his seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, despite an aggressive challenge from Democrat Doug Applegate.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERHours after polls closed in California and results began pouring in, Issa appeared poised to lose his seat in the 49th district to Applegate, but late in the night, as nationally it became evident that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump would win the race for President of the United States, Issa pulled ahead in his fight to save his own seat.As of 10:24 a.m. PT on Wednesday morning and 100 percent of 511 voting precincts partially reporting, Issa pulled out a 51.1 percent win to Applegate's 48.9 percent. The California Secretary of State logged 93,684 votes for Issa and 89,704 for Applegate at that time, a difference of less than 4,000 votes. He's served nearly sixteen years in Congress.In October, President Barack Obama helped Applegate raise cash at a minimum $10,000-a-plate fundraiser in La Jolla, California, according to CNN. Obama mocked Trump and Issa at the time on a number of fronts including deriding Issa's offer of prayers at the annual White House Christmas party. CNN reported that Obama impersonated the prayer jibing, ""Please change this man from the socialist Muslim.""With the results of California's June primary election it became clear that Issa's seat was in peril.  Issa received 50.8 percent of the vote to Applegate's 45.5 percent. No party preference candidate Ryan Glenn Wingo received 3.7 percent of the primary election vote. Under California's top-two primary system only Issa and Applegate moved on, leaving Wingo's supporters up for grabs.Back in February Issa warned that Donald Trump, not yet the Republican presidential nominee, could be the next Rep. Todd Akin whose comment about women contributed to the loss of his congressional seat. Issa heavily backed Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for president. Rubio ultimately lost the Republican presidential primary election in his home state and dropped out of the race. In March Issa suggested a brokered Republican National convention for then presidential candidate Rubio.Trump's closest primary election competitor Sen. Ted Cruz dropped out of the race in May. With only Trump left in the race, Issa endorsed Trump, the then presumptive Republican presidential nominee.Despite support from Obama for Applegate and a cash infusion, the Democrats were not able to flip the seat.San Diego Rep. Duncan Hunter, an early endorser of Trump, easily won re-election to the U.S. House of Representatives in his district, the 50th, on Tuesday night. He won with 64.2 percent to Democrat opponent Patrick Malloy's 35.8 percent.Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana SIGN UP"

(AP) -- Demonstrators opposed to the election of Donald Trump smashed windows and set garbage bins on fire in downtown Oakland, California early Wednesday, as protesters swarmed streets across the country in response to the election. The protests elsewhere were generally peaceful.In Oregon, dozens of people blocked traffic in downtown Portland and forced a delay for trains on two light rail lines. Media reports said the crowd grew to about 300 people, including some who sat in the middle of the road to block traffic. The crowd of anti-Trump protesters burned American flags and chanted ""That's not my president.""In Pennsylvania, hundreds of University of Pittsburgh students marched through the streets, with some in the crowd calling for unity. The student-run campus newspaper, the Pitt News, tweeted about an event later Wednesday titled ""Emergency Meeting: Let's Unite to Stop President Trump.""In Seattle, a group of about 100 protesters gathered in the Capital Hill neighborhood, blocked roads and set a trash bin on fire.The Oakland protest grew to about 250 people by late Tuesday evening, according to police. Officer Marco Marquez said protesters damaged five businesses, breaking windows and spraying graffiti.Police issued a citation for a vehicle code violation, but did not make any arrests.A woman was struck by a car and severely injured when protesters got onto a highway early Wednesday morning, the California Highway Patrol said. Protesters vandalized the driver's SUV before officers intervened. The highway was closed for about 20 minutes.Marquez said the department is fully staffed for the possibility of another protest Wednesday evening.Oakland is a hotbed of violent protest in the San Francisco Bay Area. Protesters briefly shut down two major freeways, vandalized police cars and looted businesses two years ago when a Missouri grand jury decided not to indict a white police officer in the fatal shooting of a black teenager in Ferguson.And nearly 80 people were arrested after a night in 2010 that saw rioters using metal bats to break store windows, setting fires and looting after a white transit police officer, Johannes Mehserle, was acquitted of murder and convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the slaying of Oscar Grant, an unarmed black man who was shot dead on a train platform the previous year.Elsewhere in California, police said at least 500 people swarmed on streets in and around UCLA, some shouting anti-Trump expletives and others chanting ""Not my president!""Smaller demonstrators were held at University of California campuses and neighborhoods in Berkeley, Irvine and Davis and at San Jose State.BREITBART LIVE"

They were strongly opposed by the NRA at every turn in the road and, in the end, the NRA won. And this was by no means the first time the NRA defeated Kaine.Breitbart News previously reported that Kaine suffered three resounding loses to the NRA between April 2013 and June 2016:He assumed the office of U.S. Senator for Virginia in January 2013 and immediately threw his support behind Senator Joe Manchin's (D-WV) post-Sandy Hook gun control legislation. The NRA opposed the legislation and it was soundly defeated on April 17, 2013.Moreover, just one day after the December 2, 2015 San Bernardino terror attack Senate Democrats tried to use the heightened sense of emotion to squeak through a gun control bill adding terror watch-lists to background checks-although the San Bernardino attackers were not on any list. MSNBC reported that every Democrat Senator except Heidi Heitkamp (D-SD) voted for the gun control. The NRA opposed it. The measure was defeated.Following the June 12, 2016 Orlando terror attack Kaine co-sponsored an amendment which would have added watch-lists to background checks thereby expanding gun control. The amendment was authored by Senator Dianne Eeinstein (D-CA), and would have given the Attorney General of the United States the power to intervene without due process and block people suspected-but not convicted-of crimes from buying a gun. The NRA opposed this amendment and it was defeated on June 20.But he ignored these loses when speaking to the Progressive National Baptist Convention on August 11, 2016.
