""I guess you got to give them credit for that.""Flournoy then suggested that the trio get together for a phone call to discuss the issue offline.The emailed discussion occurred in July 2014, as rumors swirled around Clinton's relationship with his wife. The conversation was made public as part of the WikiLeaks leaks of Podesta's private email account.In December of 2014, Mills emailed Podesta with the subject line ""Julie.""""Saw her pic in this or last weeks Enquirer,"" Podesta wrote. ""Probably need to revisit our Whitehaven conversation.""The New York Post reports that the email was likely discussing Julie Tauber McMahon as the ""Energizer"" according to a book by former agent Ronald Kessler.""K,"" Mills replied.It was not the only story that the team flagged for closer discussion.In Feb. 2014, the three aides emailed about Kathleen Willey insisting that Hillary enabled Bill's behavior and tried to discredit her allegations.""Well, this certainty shows an organized assault,"" Podesta replied, after Flournoy said that she saw the story the previous night and ""ignored it.""The running theory was that the hits on Clinton's personal life were being ""coordinated"" by nefarious parties, including Fox News chief Roger Ailes.In February 2014, Washington Post reporter Dan Balz emailed Former Deputy Secretary of State Thomas Nides to ask about rumors.""Confidentially: Rumors around that the NYT is digging into Clinton/Bill Clinton and ready to pop something,"" he wrote. ""Do you know what this is about?""Nides forwarded the email to Mills who sent the email to Flournoy and Podesta and Bruce Lindsey, a lawyer working for the Clinton FoundationFlournoy replied with inside information from New York Times reporter Amy Chozick.""According to Amy C of the Times - they don't have the story and are working off of rumors. Rumor they are trying to run down is that he had a ""roommate"" in Chappy,"" Flournoy wrote. ""This is somewhat of a coordinated effort - Roger Ailes deeply involved.""It appears that the New York Times story on the topic was never published.In March 2014, Mills emailed Podesta and Flournoy a link to a TMZ story about Bill Clinton posing with ""two star hookers at the famed Nevada Bunny Ranch brothel.""There is, as yet, no response from Podesta released.SIGN UP"

O'Keefe's team has also uncovered evidence that Democratic consultants may have been relaying messages to and from Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and super PACs using a system one consultant called ""the Pony Express."" Campaigns and Super PACs are not permitted by law to coordinate with each other.In the preface to the second video, O'Keefe states that the first video ""blew up on social media, but sources have told us that several large corporate media outlets are afraid to cover our discoveries for fear of future retribution from a Hillary Clinton administration. Truth is dangerous especially when it challenges power.""This second investigation features an undercover Project Veritas reporter posing as a Democratic Party donor brainstorming an elaborate voter fraud scheme to fraudulently register people to vote in various states using the lax voter registration policies currently in place.Like O'Keefe's first video, the second also prominently features Democratic operatives Robert Creamer and his colleague Scott Foval, who was removed from his position at the leftwing advocacy group Americans United for Change on Monday as a result of O'Keefe's investigation. O'Keefe notes that at the time the second video was shot, Foval ""worked for People for the American Way, an organization funded in large part by George Soros.""In the video, Foval is heard saying, ""We manipulated the vote with money and action, not with laws.""He then explains:It's a pretty easy thing for Republicans to say, 'Well, they're bussing people in!' Well, you know what? We've been bussing people in to deal with you fuckin' assholes for fifty years, and we're not going to stop now. We're just going to find a different way to do it. So, I mean I grew up with that idea. They used to bus people out to Iowa. If they needed people there we'd bus people out to Iowa.Foval also discusses the problem of being caught, stating, ""The question is, whether when you get caught by a reporter, does that matter? Because does it turn into an investigation or not? In this case, this state, the answer is no, because they don't have any power to do anything.""Foval suggests that the voter fraud scheme could potentially be implemented ""on a much bigger scale. You implement a massive change in state legislatures and in Congress. So you aim higher for your goals, and you implement it across every Republican-held state.""He then speculates on ""the ripest environment to do it in"":Honestly the ripest environment to do it in? Two, within striking distance. Michigan, Indiana. Least restrictive donation caps and campaign finance laws and investigative arms, and any of that. Like they have weakened it so bad in those three states, you could fuck your mother in front of the governor and not go to jail. If you have enough money to do this.Creamer, as Breitbart's Joel Pollak reported, is ""a veteran Chicago activist and convicted felon who is thought to have planned Democrats' political strategy during the push for Obamacare in 2009 and 2010. Creamer is also the co-founder of Democracy Partners, a consulting group that, according to Project Veritas videos, apparently contracts directly with the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC, and that works with an array of super PACs and consultants to organize, film and publicize their provocations.""Foval is heard in the second video saying:Bob Creamer is diabolical and I love him for it. I have learned so much from that man over the last twenty years, I can't even tell you. And he calls me to be his firefighter a lot of the time, because there are people who in our movement will not do what it takes to get shit done. And I'm not that person. I'm the one they send when everything has gone to shit. And so he spends a lot of time on the phone with my boss asking me to go places that I don't wish to go.While the second video captures Foval and the Project Veritas undercover reporter brainstorming about the voter fraud scheme, O'Keefe notes that ""Creamer hesitated to help our 'donor' pull off the voter fraud scheme that Foval crafted.""However, Foval did put the Project Veritas ""donor"" in touch with another leftwing operative who appeared more receptive: Cesar Vargas.As O'Keefe explains: ""Vargas is an interesting character. He is the co-founder of the Dream Action Coalition, a New York lawyer, and is a dreamer himself. Born in Mexico, Vargas is an undocumented alien. He has known Bob Creamer for years.""In the video, Vargas is heard saying about the voter fraud scheme:Like I said, this is not gonna happen this election. So I think it's about, for us, let's see who the next president is. If it - if it's Donald Trump, it even makes more sense. The issue will be more credible and it'll give us more opportunity to jump in there. If it's Secretary Clinton, and the voter ID laws are losing and we have much more opportunity to vote, and we have immigration reform, it's not going to be as significant, right?When the Project Veritas reporter points out that this would be ""voter fraud,"" Vergas replies, ""It's civil disobedience.""The video ends with a clip of Foval stating, ""We have to do a better job of making our people do what they're supposed to do. Not asking them. Making them. Not expecting them and taking them for granted, but beating the shit out of them.""O'Keefe notes that more videos in this undercover investigation ""will continue through the election.""Update:J. Christian Adams, the President and General Counsel of the Public Interest Legal Foundation, has filed a legal complaint with the Federal Election Commission against ""Hillary for America, the Democratic National Committee, Democracy Partners, Americans United for Change, and other known and unknown individuals and groups"" based on O'Keefe's second video investigation.Adams issued the following statement to Breitbart News:American voter rolls are corrupted with unacceptable numbers of aliens who are illegally registered to vote. Groups should not be coordinating with campaigns and political parties to exploit vulnerabilities in our election system. We hope this matter is fully investigated and that if aliens are voting, they are prosecuted by the Justice Department. That would mark a change in DOJ policies of the last 7 years.As the complaint notes, the Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF) is ""is a non-profit educational and legal foundation dedicated to protect the right to vote, preserve the Constitutional framework of American elections, and educate the public on the issue of election integrity.""Read their complaint here.It's a pretty easy thing for Republicans to say, 'Well, they're bussing people in!' Well, you know what? We've been bussing people in to deal with you fuckin' assholes for fifty years, and we're not going to stop now. We're just going to find a different way to do it.

Their research relied upon data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES).The professors found ""that some non-citizens participate in U.S. elections, and that this participation has been large enough to change meaningful election outcomes including Electoral College votes, and Congressional elections.""As the Washington Post article stated:The report came the same week that the North Carolina State Board of Elections found the names of 145 individuals on voting rolls who were ineligible to vote because they were illegal immigrants who had been recipients of Obama's 2012 executive amnesty (DACA).As Breitbart's Caroline May reported at the time:According to a Winston-Salem Journal report, the State Board of Elections discovered the potential illegal voters... when the N.C. Division of Motor Vehicles ran a search for DACA licenses... DACA beneficiaries in North Carolina are able to obtain drivers licenses, but they are not able to vote. The Journal notes that it is likely more ineligible people may still remain on the voting rolls. ""Nearly 10,000 names on the rolls are tagged by the DMV as 'legally present,' according to elections and transportation officials. But that doesn't mean that all 10,000 are ineligible to vote at this time. These are license holders who were not U.S. citizens when they got a license."" [...] According to the report, earlier this month the SBOE officials did a sample cross-check of 1,600 of the 10,000 ""legally present"" names against a Department of Homeland Security database and found... that six percent were ineligible [to vote], meaning if the ratio held for the whole 10,000, 600 people would be ineligible.During a recent North Carolina rally, Donald Trump warned that the election is being ""rigged"". Trump later tweeted:The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many polling places - SAD-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2016Despite its own reporting on voter fraud and the role non-citizen foreign nationals likely had in delivering Democratic victories in close elections, the Washington Post now seems to be disregarding its own coverage on the issue in order to characterize Trump's claims as ""ridiculous,"" ""unsubstantiated"" and part of ""broad conspiracy theories"".House Speaker Paul Ryan has similarly sought to denounce the concerns of voter fraud expressed by his Party's nominee- insisting that the election results will be inherently secure. Ryan's spokesman told Buzzfeed that the Republican House Speaker is ""fully confident"" the election will be carried out ""with integrity"".The statement from Ryan's office is remarkable given the fact that, as the 2014 Washington Post report suggests, the health care law Ryan claims to oppose may only have been possible because non-citizen foreign nationals illegally cast their ballots in U.S. elections.
How many non-citizens participate in U.S. elections? [...] Our best guess... is that 6.4 percent of non-citizens voted in 2008 and 2.2 percent of non-citizens voted in 2010... Because non-citizens tended to favor Democrats (Obama won more than 80 percent of the votes of non-citizens in the 2008 CCES sample), we find that this participation was large enough to plausibly account for Democratic victories in a few close elections. Non-citizen votes could have given Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass health-care reform and other Obama administration priorities in the 111th Congress. Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) won election in 2008 with a victory margin of 312 votes. Votes cast by just 0.65 percent of Minnesota non-citizens could account for this margin. It is also possible that non-citizen votes were responsible for Obama's 2008 victory in North Carolina. Obama won the state by 14,177 votes, so a turnout by 5.1 percent of North Carolina's adult non-citizens would have provided this victory margin.
According to a Winston-Salem Journal report, the State Board of Elections discovered the potential illegal voters... when the N.C. Division of Motor Vehicles ran a search for DACA licenses... DACA beneficiaries in North Carolina are able to obtain drivers licenses, but they are not able to vote. The Journal notes that it is likely more ineligible people may still remain on the voting rolls.

""We know that the media is corrupt and biased. It's become a cliche. But this is something I've never seen. We're like the barbarians at the gate. There are millions of people on Twitter who are trumpeting this. I'm getting 10,000 retweets, and yet not a single crack in the mainstream media.""""We've done stories where the New York Times will do a little blog entry,"" O'Keefe allowed, but otherwise, there has been ""nothing, nothing"" written in the mainstream media about his recent work - even though, as he noted, the activist that he caught on tape admitting to organizing political violence to benefit the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign has now resigned from his position.Marlow summed up the state of Project Veritas' investigation: ""You've infiltrated a Clinton Super PAC. Not only have you exposed that they claim to be communicating regularly with the Clinton campaign, which is illegal, but they are putting in massive amounts of resources to quite aggressively create violence during the Trump rallies, and then plan to blame them on Trump.""After Marlow played a clip from the undercover Project Veritas video, O'Keefe said it was ""evidence of criminal campaign coordination violations,"" since ""a Super PAC can't work with Hillary's campaign.""""The great news is, there's no circumstantial evidence. It's solid. The piece is bulletproof,"" he added. ""There hasn't been a single negative comment from any left-wing media company trying to undermine this because there's nothing they can say.""""Let me tell you something else: Bob Creamer goes to the White House. My undercover was invited to the White House,"" he continued. ""Now, I couldn't go because I couldn't get in. I wouldn't dare use a fake ID. That's illegal. But I was invited to the White House. I was on White House conference calls, my team was. And they were working with the Hillary campaign. Bob Creamer in the video says Hillary knows what's going on, through the chain of command. The problem is, these are not low-level people for them."" (Bob Creamer is one of the activists captured in the undercover Project Veritas video.)""Now they did axe Scott Foval, who is not either a low-level person, but they're trying to make him take the fall,"" O'Keefe continued, referring to the other star of the undercover video, who was removed from his position with Americans United for Change on Monday. ""Scott Foval makes it explicit. He says, quote, 'The Clinton campaign pays the DNC, the DNC pays this outfit called Democracy Partners, Democracy Partners pays my organization, and we go out and we do the ...' and then the expletive.""(Here O'Keefe was carefully avoiding a term for bovine excrement, which Foval employed as a euphemism for his group's organized effort to violate campaign finance laws. His quote, edited for profanity, was ""and we go out and we do the s*** on the ground."")""By the way, the reason we were able to gain access to all these institutions is because we spent a year - a year - building relationships with these people,"" he added. ""Unlike conspiracies where there's circumstantial evidence, this is explicit, it's illegal, there's documents to back it up.""As for what comes next, O'Keefe teased, ""We talked about how this election is rigged? You won't believe what you see later today. We'll be done with this production in a few hours, export it, and I'll make sure I send you a copy of it so you guys can cover it.""He said that what Project Veritas does ""requires patience, and it requires focus.""These are qualities the mainstream media lacks, in O'Keefe's estimation. He complained about ""a media environment where, first of all, yesterday you turn on the television and you see a corgi walking up stairs. That's what Fox was playing. I kid you not. They were playing cats playing patty cake. The media is not only corrupt, they're complacent, and they can't question power because they need access to that power.""""Trump is a proxy vote,"" he continued. ""Even if you don't like Trump per se, personally, he's the proxy vote against the corrupt media and complacent Establishment because if Trump were to get in, these journalists would lose all their access. They would not be able to have their status quo, and it is literally a fight for their very survival.""He said mainstream media reports understand that if Trump wins, ""they're sidelined, and they have no power, and they're panicking right now.""""What you see with this investigation is, you see the fact that they're panicking, the fact that they are freaking out. I mean, I've done many stories. I think this is the biggest one we've ever, ever done,"" O'Keefe said. ""I mean, we've done some things where people have said some terrible, disgusting things, but this is White House-level stuff, and not a single journalist has reported this. Not a single mainstream media journalist.""He recalled meeting Andrew Breitbart and showing him some earlier undercover videos about the advocacy group ACORN, prompting Breitbart to declare, ""James, this is going to embarrass the New York Times."" O'Keefe remembered Breitbart accurately predicting that the media would be ""dragged kicking and screaming"" into covering the story. O'Keefe echoed that comment from Breitbart in a tweet today about his latest expose, saluting the power of social media to bypass traditional media gatekeepers.""Here's the thing that didn't exist eight years ago. Right now, on Twitter, it's nothing short of a phenomenon,"" he said. ""I have never, ever seen anything like this. I mean, ten thousand Twitter followers a day, and there's like thirty thousand people on Reddit - an army who are just tweeting at journalists and emailing journalists, flooding their inboxes: 'Why the hell aren't you covering this?' That didn't exist. That did not exist eight years ago. We did not have this type of army.""He expressed some disappointment with Fox News and other outlets that might normally have been willing to break from the mainstream media herd. ""My sources have told me this story was spiked by major - I don't want to call them 'friendly,' but people who you'd think would be friendly to our type of journalism,"" O'Keefe revealed. ""This story was spiked, last minute, by corporate people. And the reason why they spiked it, I suspect, is because they're afraid of retaliation and retribution from a Department of Justice, whether a future Hillary Clinton administration, or a current White House Department of Justice.""""We don't have a separation of powers in this country,"" O'Keefe declared. ""These publicly traded media companies can't do it. They can't get blood on their hands. They can't break news. We are living in an American Pravda. I don't think we've ever seen anything like this. The more true it gets, the worse it gets. They're not going to not cover this story, Alex, because it's false. They're not gonna cover the story because it's true. And the more lethally, effectively real the things that we're exposing, the less likely that companies are actually going to expose it.""""That's it. All you have left are the citizen-journalists in this country,"" he warned. ""That's all we have left. Here's what I'm going to do today: I'm going to activate our army, and I'm going to flood the inboxes of these journalists. I'm going to shame them.

And I tweeted him back, and I said, 'Brit, I reached out to Fox one week ago. I emailed your reporters. You can come to my office. I can come to your office. I can show you the raw tapes if you'd like. You can vet it. But don't give me the excuse that you gotta look at it. You guys aired for a week, for a week, you aired the hidden camera sex audio,'"" he recalled, referring to the tape of Donald Trump making lewd comments more than a decade ago.""If this video was aired for seven days, I guarantee you Trump would win the election. I guarantee it. So the media's choices about their assignment editing is political, and we're gonna get around it by activating our army,"" O'Keefe declared.Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.LISTEN:SIGN UPO'Keefe said he has never seen anything like the response to his Democrat-violence expose, which has become an ""Internet phenomenon.""""You and I have worked together for probably six, seven years now,"" he told SiriusXM host Alex Marlow. ""We know that the media is corrupt and biased. It's become a cliche. But this is something I've never seen. We're like the barbarians at the gate. There are millions of people on Twitter who are trumpeting this. I'm getting 10,000 retweets, and yet not a single crack in the mainstream media.""""We've done stories where the New York Times will do a little blog entry,"" O'Keefe allowed, but otherwise, there has been ""nothing, nothing"" written in the mainstream media about his recent work - even though, as he noted, the activist that he caught on tape admitting to organizing political violence to benefit the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign has now resigned from his position.Marlow summed up the state of Project Veritas' investigation: ""You've infiltrated a Clinton Super PAC. Not only have you exposed that they claim to be communicating regularly with the Clinton campaign, which is illegal, but they are putting in massive amounts of resources to quite aggressively create violence during the Trump rallies, and then plan to blame them on Trump.""After Marlow played a clip from the undercover Project Veritas video, O'Keefe said it was ""evidence of criminal campaign coordination violations,"" since ""a Super PAC can't work with Hillary's campaign.""""The great news is, there's no circumstantial evidence. It's solid. The piece is bulletproof,"" he added. ""There hasn't been a single negative comment from any left-wing media company trying to undermine this because there's nothing they can say.""""Let me tell you something else: Bob Creamer goes to the White House. My undercover was invited to the White House,"" he continued. ""Now, I couldn't go because I couldn't get in. I wouldn't dare use a fake ID. That's illegal. But I was invited to the White House. I was on White House conference calls, my team was. And they were working with the Hillary campaign. Bob Creamer in the video says Hillary knows what's going on, through the chain of command. The problem is, these are not low-level people for them."" (Bob Creamer is one of the activists captured in the undercover Project Veritas video.)""Now they did axe Scott Foval, who is not either a low-level person, but they're trying to make him take the fall,"" O'Keefe continued, referring to the other star of the undercover video, who was removed from his position with Americans United for Change on Monday. ""Scott Foval makes it explicit. He says, quote, 'The Clinton campaign pays the DNC, the DNC pays this outfit called Democracy Partners, Democracy Partners pays my organization, and we go out and we do the ...' and then the expletive.""(Here O'Keefe was carefully avoiding a term for bovine excrement, which Foval employed as a euphemism for his group's organized effort to violate campaign finance laws. His quote, edited for profanity, was ""and we go out and we do the s*** on the ground."")""By the way, the reason we were able to gain access to all these institutions is because we spent a year - a year - building relationships with these people,"" he added. ""Unlike conspiracies where there's circumstantial evidence, this is explicit, it's illegal, there's documents to back it up.""As for what comes next, O'Keefe teased, ""We talked about how this election is rigged? You won't believe what you see later today. We'll be done with this production in a few hours, export it, and I'll make sure I send you a copy of it so you guys can cover it.""He said that what Project Veritas does ""requires patience, and it requires focus.""These are qualities the mainstream media lacks, in O'Keefe's estimation. He complained about ""a media environment where, first of all, yesterday you turn on the television and you see a corgi walking up stairs. That's what Fox was playing. I kid you not. They were playing cats playing patty cake. The media is not only corrupt, they're complacent, and they can't question power because they need access to that power.""""Trump is a proxy vote,"" he continued. ""Even if you don't like Trump per se, personally, he's the proxy vote against the corrupt media and complacent Establishment because if Trump were to get in, these journalists would lose all their access. They would not be able to have their status quo, and it is literally a fight for their very survival.""He said mainstream media reports understand that if Trump wins, ""they're sidelined, and they have no power, and they're panicking right now.""""What you see with this investigation is, you see the fact that they're panicking, the fact that they are freaking out. I mean, I've done many stories. I think this is the biggest one we've ever, ever done,"" O'Keefe said. ""I mean, we've done some things where people have said some terrible, disgusting things, but this is White House-level stuff, and not a single journalist has reported this. Not a single mainstream media journalist.""He recalled meeting Andrew Breitbart and showing him some earlier undercover videos about the advocacy group ACORN, prompting Breitbart to declare, ""James, this is going to embarrass the New York Times."" O'Keefe remembered Breitbart accurately predicting that the media would be ""dragged kicking and screaming"" into covering the story. O'Keefe echoed that comment from Breitbart in a tweet today about his latest expose, saluting the power of social media to bypass traditional media gatekeepers.""Here's the thing that didn't exist eight years ago. Right now, on Twitter, it's nothing short of a phenomenon,"" he said. ""I have never, ever seen anything like this. I mean, ten thousand Twitter followers a day, and there's like thirty thousand people on Reddit - an army who are just tweeting at journalists and emailing journalists, flooding their inboxes: 'Why the hell aren't you covering this?' That didn't exist. That did not exist eight years ago. We did not have this type of army.""He expressed some disappointment with Fox News and other outlets that might normally have been willing to break from the mainstream media herd. ""My sources have told me this story was spiked by major - I don't want to call them 'friendly,' but people who you'd think would be friendly to our type of journalism,"" O'Keefe revealed. ""This story was spiked, last minute, by corporate people. And the reason why they spiked it, I suspect, is because they're afraid of retaliation and retribution from a Department of Justice, whether a future Hillary Clinton administration, or a current White House Department of Justice.""""We don't have a separation of powers in this country,"" O'Keefe declared. ""These publicly traded media companies can't do it. They can't get blood on their hands. They can't break news. We are living in an American Pravda. I don't think we've ever seen anything like this. The more true it gets, the worse it gets. They're not going to not cover this story, Alex, because it's false. They're not gonna cover the story because it's true And the more lethally, effectively real the things that we're exposing, the less likely that companies are actually going to expose it.""""That's it. All you have left are the citizen-journalists in this country,"" he warned. ""That's all we have left. Here's what I'm going to do today: I'm going to activate our army, and I'm going to flood the inboxes of these journalists. I'm going to shame them. If nothing else, they'll respond to the tweets and come up with some excuse."" ""Brit Hume tweeted at me, from Fox, yesterday, and he said, 'We need to look through this.' And I tweeted him back, and I said, 'Brit, I reached out to Fox one week ago. I emailed your reporters. You can come to my office. I can come to your office.

They discuss, ahead of a March 18 ""press call with AZ locals about guns,"" how they will go after Donald Trump on the issue.Podesta's succinct response: ""Interestingly, I am worried about blowback from our supporters.""In the other email thread, dated November 5, 2015, Margolis addresses the draft of a speech in which Clinton was to say, ""I represented New York in the Senate, and New York City has much stricter gun laws than upstate New York, because their needs are different. That's why I think it's important that localities be able to make that decision for themselves."" Margolis did not want to leave the door open for localities to make their own decisions, but he could not take the chance of offending rural voters.

That deal established ""the comprehensive lifting of all UN Security Council sanctions as well as multilateral and national sanctions related to Iran's nuclear programme.""""There is a tremendous amount of potential in these inter Faith orgs including the ability to reach so me [sic] working class voters,"" his message read, to which Podesta praised him for the group's ""great effort.""The report from the group's executive director Christopher J. Hale detailed a strategy for encouraging members of congress to support the controversial Iran deal, which was eventually effected on July 14, 2016.The strategy revolved around convincing leading Catholic prelates to use their influence to pressure congresspersons into accepting the deal.""While I think there should be many goals for these meetings, I think the top-line goal is pretty clear: we need Archbishop William Lori and Cardinal Donald Wuerl to make direct appeals to Senators Cardin and Mikulski on this issue,"" Hale writes. ""While I don't have any advance knowledge, I have a sense from the conversations setting up the meetings that there might be willingness for that to happen.""Along with outreach to Catholic bishops, Hale reported that the group had taken out advertisements in the liberal Catholic journals National Catholic Reporter and Commonweal.Hale said that his ""colleagues will be working with our allies to scan the local newspapers this upcoming week to see if people are communicating faith values in supporting the deal to letters to the editors in newspapers across the nation.""""That would be something to be proud of for our group,"" he stated.The director also referred to the group's ""grueling preparation for Pope Francis's apostolic trip to the US.""""As you can imagine, Iran is just a portion of the work we're doing in preparation for the Holy Father's trip,"" he said.Along with efforts to infiltrate the Church hierarchy, the organization's collusion with the Obama administration is made apparent in Hale's report.""I spoke to the White House yesterday and they assure us the media's moniker calling us 'God Squad' isn't just sweet nothings, but actually a fair assessment of the substantial difference we're making in this conversation,"" he wrote.Following last week's Wikileaks revelations, Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput described a meeting with two members of the other ""Catholic"" organization that Podesta claims to have founded--Catholics United. In a published essay, Chaput depicts a methodology eerily similar to that employed by Catholics in Alliance.Chaput said that the two men were ""obvious flacks for the Obama campaign and the Democratic Party--creatures of a political machine, not men of the Church,"" who showed remarkable ""talents of servile partisan hustling.""""And presumably (for them) bishops were dumb enough to be used as tools,"" he said.In a stinging statement, the head of the U.S. Bishops Conference, Archbishop Joseph E. Kurtz, issued his own indictment of the Clinton team, calling them out for interfering in the Church's self-governance for ""short-term political gain.""Kurtz suggested that Podesta's actions in creating ""Catholic"" lobby groups for the Democratic Party constituted a breach of religious freedom, ""one of the founding principles of our republic,"" which ensures the right of faith communities to ""preserve the integrity of their beliefs and proper self-governance.""As more and more comes out detailing exactly how these groups exploited the Catholic hierarchy as ""useful idiots"" for political gains, the less likely their ploys will work in the future and the more suspicious Catholics will be of any friendly overtures coming from the Clinton campaign.Follow Thomas D.

The interviewee, whose name is redacted on the document, ""served as an Assistant Shift Leader on former Secretary of State CONDOLEEZZA RICE's and HILLARY CLINTON's protective details.""This woman said Clinton treated the agents protecting her and her staff's lives with ""contempt."" The document states: ""[Redacted] explained that CLINTON's treatment of DS agents on her protective detail was so contemptuous that many of them sought reassignment or employment elsewhere.""Prior to CLINTON's tenure, being an agent on the Secretary of State's protective detail was seen as an honor and privilege reserved for senior agents. However, by the end of CLINTON's tenure, it was staffed largely with new agents because it was difficult to find senior agents willing to work for her.""[Redacted] claims to have had at least one conversation with Secret Service agents who experienced the same poor treatment.""The individual giving this interview also claimed Clinton would put her staff in dangerous situations against the advice of her security -- and agents suspected that she did so to generate ""favorable press"" and photo ops that she could use for a presidential campaign.On a trip to Jakarta, Indonesia, in early 2009, CLINTON requested to visit an area of Jakarta that presented security and safety challenges. This visit was reportedly for a photo opportunity regarding CLINTON's ""clean cooking stoves"" initiative. The DS advance team recommended against traveling to this area because the route could not be secured and was lined with dangerous circumstances and individuals. As such, the DS advance team recommended in writing that this excursion be stricken from the schedule but were told by DS management that it was going to happen because ""she wanted it."" DS agents felt this excursion into potentially hostile areas placed CLINTON, her staff, the media, and her security detail in unnecessary danger in order to conduct a photo opportunity for ""her election campaign."" DS agents had the perception that CLINTON was using her position as Secretary of State to campaign for President of the United States. DS agents felt CLINTON traveled with hand-picked media who would present her in favorable light in order to garner political support. It was also believed that CLINTON disregarded security and diplomatic protocols, occasionally without regard for the safety of her staff and protection detail, in order to gain favorable press. [emphasis added]The interviewee recalled an anecdote where Clinton exposed her limousine driver to danger by badgering him to open a window in ""a dangerous area of the West Bank"":CLINTON traveled in an armored vehicle whose passenger windows do not open. This is a design feature for the protection of the occupants. However, the driver's window does open slightly. On one occasion while traveling to Palestine CLINTON ordered the limousine driver, believed to be [Redacted] to open the window while in ""occupied territory"", referring to a dangerous area of the West Bank. [Redacted] initially declined to respond to CLINTON's request; however, repeated demands by CLINTON forced him to open his window despite the danger to himself and the occupants.This testimony echoes the accounts of several Secret Service agents who have similarly described Clinton's behavior as abusive.Author Ronald Kessler, who has written several books based on interviews with USSS agents, has one interviewee who gives the exact same assessment as the former State employee:There's not an agent in the service who wants to be in Hillary's detail. If agents get the nod to go to her detail, that's considered a form of punishment among the agents. She's hard to work around, she's known to snap at agents and yell at agents and dress them down to their faces, and they just have to be humble and say, ""Yes ma'am,"" and walk away. Agents don't deserve that. They're there to do a job, they're there to protect her, they'll lay their life down for hers, and there's absolutely no respect for that. And that's why agents do not want to go to her detail.Former Secret Service agent Gary Byrne released a book, Crisis of Character, earlier this year alleging that she would have regular ""eruptions"" over small slights or even polite greetings. ""She'd explode in my face without reservation or decorum,"" Byrne said of his first-hand experiences. One colleague reported that Clinton responded to him saying, ""Good morning, First Lady,"" with a ""Go f*** yourself."" Another told Byrne that she threw a Bible and hit him in the back of the head in an episode of rage.On a trip to Jakarta, Indonesia, in early 2009, CLINTON requested to visit an area of Jakarta that presented security and safety challenges.

At one point she invited a Trump supporter on to the stage and asked him why he supports the Republican presidential nominee.""Do you get worried at all with how impulsive he is,"" Schumer asked, ""that he gets so fired up from Saturday Night Live doing a skit on him? Do you worry he'll be impulsive and get us in a lot of f--ing trouble we can't get out of?""After dismissing the audience member from the stage, Schumer asked survivors of sexual assault in the crowd to stand.Schumer, who's known for her hyper-sexual raunchy brand of comedy, continued to rip Trump over lewd remarks he made about women in a caught-on-tape conversation in 2005 with former Access Hollywood anchor Billy Bush.""I can't imagine looking at my little niece, who's two and a half, and saying, 'This is our president, he wants to finger his daughter,'"" Schumer joked.Moments later, loud boos began to rang out after Schumer began to explain to the audience why she ""likes Hillary.""Schumer, seemingly shaken and upset over heckling crowd members, said, ""just so you know, from now on, if you yell out, you're going to get thrown out.""The boos grew louder, and Schumer responded by instructing audience members to ""point to the people booing.""Schumer's standup soon turned to gun control, as she recounted the incident involving a deadly shooting in Louisiana during the opening for her movie Train Wreck last year, where a gunman opened fire, killing two young women, Mayci Breaux and Jillian Johnson.Not shying away from her dogged support for Hillary Clinton, a large portion of Schumer's routine covered an oft-repeated story about the time she performed standup at the former secretary of state's birthday party.Before her performance Sunday, Schumer was seen participating in a voter registration drive.Letting voters lean on her while they update their voter registration! #ImWithHer pic.twitter.com/WifLjlbKd7-- Hillary for Florida (@HillaryforFL) October 16, 2016Last month Schumer joined the growing list of celebrities to vow to leave the U.S. should Trump win the election in November.""My act will change because I will need to learn to speak Spanish,"" she said during an appearance on BBC's Newsnight.

Clinton told MSNBC:It may be hard for your viewers to remember how difficult it was to talk about HIV [and] AIDS back in the 1980s. Because of both President and Mrs. Reagan, in particular Mrs. Reagan, we started a national conversation where before nobody would talk about it. Nobody wanted anything to do with it.""It penetrated the public conscience,"" Clinton added. ""People began to say, 'Hey, we have to do something about this, too.'""An email thread, marked with four exclamation points (!!!!) and dated the next day - March 12 - shows Clinton campaign staffers Lauren Peterson, Megan Rooney, Nick Merrill, Maya Harris, and Xochitl Hinojosa scrambling to produce a statement for Clinton in which she would walk back her praise of the Reagans.""Here is a revised draft of a statement,"" writes Rooney. ""It does include the words 'I made a mistake' in the first line.""""We need a strategy for getting her to approve this,"" she continues. ""I don't know if that means someone who is traveling with her (Maya?) making the case... or something else.""A draft statement read:Yesterday, at Nancy Reagan's funeral, I made a mistake in speaking about the Reagans' record on HIV and AIDS. Since then, I've heard from countless people who were devastated by the loss of friends and loved ones, and hurt and disappointed by what I said, and I understand why. My comment was just wrong.I want to use this opportunity to talk not only about where we've come from but where we must go in the fight against HIV and AIDS.To be clear, the Reagans did not start a national conversation about HIV and AIDS. Unfortunately, the opposite was true. That distinction belongs to generations of brave men and women who started not just a conversation but a movement that continues to this day.Hinojosa wrote:Flagging that there was a whole segment on MSNBC where someone with HIV/AIDS said that HRC's apology wasn't enough. Buzzfeed is also writing a follow up piece on whether our supporters and activists were satisfied.

LGBT media is also hearing from angry people.""I think we really should do everything we can to get this up today, if at all possible (fingers crossed),"" wrote Peterson. ""Does not seem to be dying down online, either.""The staff then revised Clinton's statement to say:Yesterday, at Nancy Reagan's funeral, I said something inaccurate when speaking about the Reagans' record on HIV and AIDS. Since then, I've heard from countless people who were devastated by the loss of friends and loved ones, and hurt and disappointed by what I said, and I understand why. I made a mistake, plain and simple.Los Angeles LGBT newspaper The Pride reports about Clinton's gaffe and the rage it produced among LGBT activist groups.Richard Socarides, a gay New York-based Democratic activist and Clinton supporter, emailed senior campaign officials to warn them the candidate should address the issue ""before this spins out of control.""""Nancy Reagan in fact helped start a national conversation about HIV and AIDS but as we all know it was far too little and way too late,"" Socarides wrote. ""When Bill Clinton ran for president in 1992 it was on a platform that was highly critical of the Republican response to the HIV crisis. It had been a record of neglect. As first lady and as senator and as Secretary of State Hillary has been a champion for increased funding and raising awareness.""Echoing Socarides' comments in a subsequent email was Steve Elemendorf, a gay Democratic lobbyist, who said he ""cannot overstate how big a problem"" the remarks were and called for immediate action from the campaign.Kristina Schake, a deputy communications director for the Clinton campaign, wrote in another email that Clinton ally and Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin was receiving complaints about Clinton's remarks and his response, which condemned the remarks but didn't reference the candidate herself.""I stayed with Chad last night who was receiving lots of angry calls and notes from people that he didn't call her out by name,"" Schake wrote. ""He wouldn't do that to her and kept stressing she just made a mistake, but suggested we need to do something more today to protect her. She has a great record and we lost a lot of ground messaging-wise.""The Pride suggests LGBT activists still have questions about why Clinton would offer praise of the Reagans.""Even though Clinton twice apologized for the remarks and recommitted herself to fight HIV/AIDS in the aftermath, it remains unclear why she made the remarks in the first place,"" the report says. ""Some have speculated she confused Nancy Reagan's work on Alzheimer's disease with HIV/AIDS; others claims the remarks were an effort to curry favor with Reagan Democrats.""It may be hard for your viewers to remember how difficult it was to talk about HIV [and] AIDS back in the 1980s. Because of both President and Mrs. Reagan, in particular Mrs. Reagan, we started a national conversation where before nobody would talk about it. Nobody wanted anything to do with it.Yesterday, at Nancy Reagan's funeral, I made a mistake in speaking about the Reagans' record on HIV and AIDS. Since then, I've heard from countless people who were devastated by the loss of friends and loved ones, and hurt and disappointed by what I said, and I understand why. My comment was just wrong.
I want to use this opportunity to talk not only about where we've come from but where we must go in the fight against HIV and AIDS.
To be clear, the Reagans did not start a national conversation about HIV and AIDS. Unfortunately, the opposite was true. That distinction belongs to generations of brave men and women who started not just a conversation but a movement that continues to this day.Flagging that there was a whole segment on MSNBC where someone with HIV/AIDS said that HRC's apology wasn't enough. Buzzfeed is also writing a follow up piece on whether our supporters and activists were satisfied. While I pointed them to folks who can be helpful, I'm sure they'll find supporters who aren't satisfied.

As Breitbart News previously reported, American taxpayers carry the costs of educating nearly four million foreign-born students who do no speak English. Most of the non-English speakers in American schools perform at extremely low levels while costing taxpayers roughly $59.8 billion per year:As the Center notes, ""half of the growth in foreign-language speakers since 2010 is among those born in the United States."" And ""overall, 44 percent (28.5 million) of those who speak a language other than English at home are U.S.-born,"" meaning these nationwide problems will only worsen over time.Eleven percent of U.S. residents spoke a language other than English at home in 1980. Only 35 years later, that share increased to 21.5 percent of the U.S. population.Arabic speakers increased dramatically in the U.S., with a 34 percent increase from 2010 to 2015:The largest percentage increases from 2010 to 2015 were among speakers of Arabic (up 34 percent), Hindi (up 33 percent), Urdu (up 24 percent), Chinese (up 19 percent), French Creole (up 16 percent), Gujarati (up 14 percent), and Persian (up 13 percent). Hindi and Gujarati are languages of India; Urdu is spoken in Pakistan; French Creole is spoken in Haiti; and Persian is the national language of Iran.The largest numerical increases from 2010 to 2015 were among speakers of Spanish (up 3.1 million), Chinese (up 525,000), Arabic (up 292,000), Hindi (up 203,000), Tagalog (up 163,000), French Creole (up 117,000), and Urdu (up 92,000). Tagalog is spoken in the Philippines...States with the largest share of their populations speaking a foreign language at home in 2015 were: California (45 percent), Texas (35 percent), New Mexico (34 percent), New York (31 percent), New Jersey (31 percent), Nevada (30 percent), Florida (29 percent), Arizona (27 percent), Hawaii (26 percent), Illinois (23 percent), and Massachusetts (23 percent).Nevada saw its share of foreign-language speakers explode from 1980 to 2015 with a 1,005 percent increase. Georgia and North Carolina saw their share increase 916 percent and 729 percent. Virginia, where 23 percent of Northern Virginia residents are foreigners and 68 percent of the state's foreign-born population is clustered around the D.C. Beltway, saw its share rise 460 percent. Florida's share increased 356 percent. North Carolina, Virginia, and Florida are must-win swing states in presidential elections. Progressives deliberately craft immigration policy to disenfranchise Americans: As President Obama told Latino audience in Florida last year, there will be a ""President Rodriguez"" ""someday"" thanks in part to him unilaterally granting illegal aliens amnesty.There were 40 million Spanish speakers, 3.3 million Chinese speakers, 1.7 million Tagalog speakers, and 1.2 million Arabic speakers in the U.S. in 2015.Forty percent of those who primarily speak a foreign language at home also told the Census Bureau they don't speak English very well.As Breitbart News previously reported, current extreme immigration levels will by 2060 import 78.2 million foreign-born people.The largest percentage increases from 2010 to 2015 were among speakers of Arabic (up 34 percent), Hindi (up 33 percent), Urdu (up 24 percent), Chinese (up 19 percent), French Creole (up 16 percent), Gujarati (up 14 percent), and Persian (up 13 percent).

I will note, however, that in a relatively brief document, the words ""object"" or ""objection"" appear 84 times. The words ""does not recall"" appear 20 times.Her responses are preceded by eight ""General Objections"" and two ""Objections to Definitions."" Her responses to 21 individual questions begin with either ""Secretary Clinton objects"" [to this interrogatory] or ""Secretary Clinton does not recall.""It is clear that her strategy in handling this court-ordered deposition is of a kind with her stonewalling and obfuscation at every step of this investigation.We submitted 25 questions on August 30 to Clinton as ordered by U.S. District Court Judge Emmet G. Sullivan. Those questions and her responses come in our Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit before Judge Sullivan. It was first filed in September 2013, seeking records about the controversial employment status of Huma Abedin, former deputy chief of staff to Clinton. The lawsuit was reopened because of revelations about the clintonemail.com system (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:13-cv-01363)).Judicial Watch has previously taken the deposition testimony of seven Clinton aides and State Department officials.Here is the full text of her responses as filed with the court:NON-PARTY HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON'S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF'S INTERROGATORIESPursuant to the Court's August 19, 2016 order and Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Non-Party Hillary Rodham Clinton hereby responds to Plaintiff's Interrogatories dated August 30, 2016. The General Objections and the Objections to the Definitions set forth below are incorporated into each of the specific responses that follow. Any specific objections are in addition to the General Objections and Objections to the Definitions, and failure to reiterate a General Objection or Objection to the Definitions does not constitute a waiver of that or any other objection.GENERAL OBJECTIONSOBJECTIONS TO DEFINITIONSRESPONSES TO INTERROGATORIESResponse: Secretary Clinton objects to Interrogatory No. 1 as outside the scope of permitted discovery. The clintonemail.com system, as that term is defined in the Instructions and subject to Secretary Clinton's objection to that definition, consisted of equipment set up to host e-mail for President Clinton's staff. Information regarding the creation of that system, including the reasons for its creation, is irrelevant to this lawsuit and outside the scope of permitted discovery. The Court permitted discovery in this case on the question of ""the purpose for the creation and operation of the clintonemail.com system for State Department business."" Dkt. #124, at 17 (emphasis added). That question is the subject of Interrogatory No. 2, which is answered below.Response: In the Senate, when Secretary Clinton began using e-mail, she used a personal e-mail account for both work-related and personal e-mail. Secretary Clinton decided to transition from the account she used in her tenure at the Senate to the clintonemail.com account. She recalls that it was created in early 2009. Secretary Clinton did not set up the account. Although Secretary Clinton does not have specific knowledge of the details of the account's creation, her best understanding is that one of President Clinton's aides, Justin Cooper, set up the account. She decided to use a clintonemail.com account for the purpose of convenience Response: Secretary Clinton recalls deciding to use a clintonemail.com e-mail account to conduct official State Department business in early 2009. She does not recall any specific consultations regarding the decision to use the clintonemail.com account for official State Department business.Response: Secretary Clinton objects to Interrogatory No. 4 insofar as it purports to request information about communications after her tenure as Secretary of State, which communications would be irrelevant to the purpose for the creation and operation of her clintonemail.com account while she was Secretary of State. Subject to the foregoing objection, Secretary Clinton states that she does not recall participating in any communications before or during her tenure as Secretary of State concerning or relating to her decision to use a clintonemail.com account to conduct official State Department business.Response: Secretary Clinton objects to Interrogatory No. 5 insofar as it misstates her comments in the 60 Minutes interview that aired on July 24, 2016. In that interview, she stated that ""it was recommended that [using personal e-mail] would be convenient."" Subject to that objection, Secretary Clinton states that former Secretary of State Colin Powell advised her in 2009 about his use of a personal e-mail account to conduct official State Department business.Response: Secretary Clinton objects to Interrogatory No. 6 on the ground that it requests information that is not within the scope of permitted discovery for the reason set forth in General Objection No. 5. Secretary Clinton further objects to Interrogatory No. 6 to the extent it requests information about communications made to other persons that were not conveyed to Secretary Clinton. Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, Secretary Clinton states that she does not recall being advised, cautioned, or warned, she does not recall that it was ever suggested to her, and she does not recall participating in any communication, conversation, or meeting in which it was discussed that her use of a clintonemail.com e-mail account to conduct official State Department business conflicted with or violated federal recordkeeping laws. Response: Secretary Clinton objects to Interrogatory No. 7 on the ground that it requests information that is not within the scope of permitted discovery for the reason set forth in General Objection No. 5. Subject to and without waiving that objection, Secretary Clinton states that she does not recall considering factors other than convenience in deciding to use a personal e-mail account to conduct official State Department business.Response: Secretary Clinton does not recall whether she had a specific expectation that the State Department would receive FOIA requests for or concerning her e-mail. She understood that, because her practice was to e-mail State Department staff on their state.gov accounts, her email was being captured in the State Department's recordkeeping systems.Response: Secretary Clinton understood that e-mail she sent or received in the course of conducting official State Department business was subject to FOIA. She further understood that, because her practice was to e-mail State Department staff on their state.gov accounts, her e-mail was being captured in the State Department's recordkeeping systems. Response: Secretary Clinton objects to Interrogatory No. 10 on the ground that it requests information that is not within the scope of permitted discovery for the reason set forth in General Objection No. 5. Secretary Clinton further objects to Interrogatory No. 10 on the ground that the word ""manage"" is vague. Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, Secretary Clinton states that her practice was to e-mail State Department staff on their state.gov e-mail accounts, and Secretary Clinton understood that those e-mails were preserved in the Department's recordkeeping systems and available to the Department in conducting searches in response to FOIA requests.Response: Secretary Clinton does not recall specifically informing the State Department's records management personnel about her use of her clintonemail.com e-mail account to conduct official State Department business; she did openly communicate via her clintonemail.com account with many people in the State Department. Secretary Clinton does not recall interacting with Clarence Finney or employees of the Executive Secretariat's Office of Correspondence and Records.Response: Secretary Clinton objects to Interrogatory No. 12 insofar as it requests information about requests for access to her clintonemail.com account that may have been directed to other persons that were not conveyed to her. Subject to the foregoing objection, Secretary Clinton states that she does not recall State Department personnel asking her for access to her clintonemail.com e-mail account to search for e-mail responsive to a FOIA request during her tenure as Secretary of State.Response: Secretary Clinton objects to Interrogatory No. 13 on the ground that it requests information that is not within the scope of permitted discovery for the reason set forth in General Objection No. 5. Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objection, Secretary Clinton states that it was her practice in conducting State Department business to e-mail State Department staff on their state.gov accounts, and she did not consider how e-mails she sent to or received from persons who did not have State Department e-mail accounts would be searched by the Department in response to FOIA requests.Response: Secretary Clinton objects to Interrogatory No. 14 as seeking information outside the scope of the permitted discovery in this case. The Court's May 4, 2016 Order provides that Plaintiff is not entitled to discovery on the subject of ""cybersecurity issues."" Dkt. #73, at 13.Response: Secretary Clinton recalls that her November 13, 2010 e-mail exchange with Huma Abedin attached as Exhibit B to Plaintiff's Interrogatories was triggered by a problem with the State Department's telephone system. When Secretary Clinton wrote, ""This is not a good system,"" she was referring to the way in which the State Department would notify her of telephone calls. Secretary Clinton does not recall what precisely she meant by the words ""address"" or ""device."" To the best of her recollection, she meant that she was willing to use a State Department e-mail account or device if it would resolve the problems with receiving telephone calls, so long as her personal e-mails with family and friends would not be accessible to the State Department. Following this e-mail exchange, the State Department changed the way in which it notified Secretary Clinton of telephone calls, resolving the problem that triggered this e-mail.Response: Secretary Clinton does not recall requesting a State Department-issued Blackberry or a State Department e-mail account in or around August 2011.Response: Secretary Clinton objects to Interrogatory No. 19 as outside the scope of permitted discovery, as the Court's May 4, 2016 Order provides that Plaintiff is not entitled to discovery on the subject of ""cybersecurity issues."" Dkt. #73, at 13. Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objection, Secretary Clinton states that she does not recall reviewing Assistant Secretary Bowell's Information Memo attached as Exhibit D to Plaintiff's Interrogatories during her tenure as Secretary of State.Response: Secretary Clinton objects to Interrogatory No. 18 as outside the scope of permitted discovery, as the Court's May 4, 2016 Order provides that Plaintiff is not entitled to discovery on the subject of ""cybersecurity issues."" Dkt. #73, at 13. Secretary Clinton further objects to Interrogatory No. 18 on the ground that it mischaracterizes Secretary Clinton as the sender and author of the June 28, 2011 cable attached to Plaintiff's Interrogatories as Exhibit E. During Secretary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, all cables originating from Main State ended with the name ""CLINTON."" The presence of Secretary Clinton's name at the end of the cable was a formality, and it did not mean that she sent, authored, or reviewed the cable. Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, Secretary Clinton states that she does not recall seeing the June 28, 2011 cable attached as Exhibit E to Plaintiff's Interrogatories during her tenure as Secretary of State.Response: Secretary Clinton objects to Interrogatory No. 19 as outside the scope of permitted discovery, as the Court's May 4, 2016 Order provides that Plaintiff is not entitled to discovery on the subject of ""cybersecurity issues."" Dkt. #73, at 13. Secretary Clinton further objects to Interrogatory No. 19 insofar as it requests information about whether Secretary Clinton was advised, cautioned, or warned about hacking or attempted hacking of her clintonemail.com e-mail account after her tenure as Secretary of State, which is irrelevant to the purpose for her creation and operation of the clintonemail.com account while Secretary of State and therefore outside the scope of permitted discovery. Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, Secretary Clinton states that she does not recall being advised, cautioned, or warned during her tenure as Secretary of State about hacking or attempted hacking of her clintonemail.com e-mail account or the server that hosted her clintonemail.com account.Response: Secretary Clinton objects to Interrogatory No. 20 on the ground that it requests information that is outside the scope of permitted discovery for the reason set forth in General Objection No. 5. Secretary Clinton further objects to Interrogatory No. 20 on the ground that the word ""manage"" is vague. Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, Secretary Clinton states that she does not recall considering whether to allow the State Department access to her clintonemail.com e-mail account when she was preparing to leave office. She believed that her e-mails with persons with state.gov e-mail accounts were already captured in the State Department's recordkeeping systems. Secretary Clinton does not recall anyone from the State Department asking her for access to her clintonemail.com e-mail account or asking her to print her work-related e-mails when she was preparing to leave office.Response: Secretary Clinton objects to Interrogatory No. 21 as outside the scope of permitted discovery in this case for the reason set forth in General Objection No. 3. Secretary Clinton further objects to Interrogatory No. 21 on the ground that it requests information that is outside the scope of permitted discovery for the reason set forth in General Objection No. 5. Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, Secretary Clinton states that she does not recall considering after she left office whether she could alter, destroy, disclose, or use emails concerning official State Department business. Secretary Clinton further refers Plaintiff to her Response to Interrogatory No. 22.Response: Secretary Clinton objects to Interrogatory No. 22 as outside the scope of permitted discovery in this case for the reason set forth in General Objection No. 3. Secretary Clinton further objects to Interrogatory No. 22 on the ground that it requests information that is outside the scope of permitted discovery for the reason set forth in General Objection No. 5. Secretary Clinton further objects to Interrogatory No. 22 insofar as it requests information about all e-mail in her clintonemail.com account, including personal e-mail. Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, Secretary Clinton states that she does not recall altering, destroying, disclosing, or using any e-mails related to official State Department business from her tenure as Secretary of State in her clintonemail.com account or instructing anyone else to do so after she left office and before her attorneys reviewed the e-mails in her clintonemail.com email account in response to the State Department's request.Response: Secretary Clinton objects to Interrogatory No. 23 as outside the scope of permitted discovery for the reason set forth in General Objection No. 3. Secretary Clinton further objects to Interrogatory No. 23 on the ground that it requests information that is outside the scope of permitted discovery for the reason set forth in General Objection No. 5. Secretary Clinton further objects to Interrogatory No. 23 insofar as it requests information about all e-mail in her clintonemail.com account, including personal e-mail. Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, Secretary Clinton states that it was her expectation that all of her work-related and potentially work-related e-mail then in her custody would be provided to the State Department in response to its request. Secretary Clinton believes that her attorneys retained copies of the e-mails provided to the State Department in December 2014, but she does not have any personal knowledge about the details of that process. Secretary Clinton decided that, once her work-related and potentially work-related e-mails were provided to the State Department, she had no reason to keep her personal e-mails, which did not relate to official State Department business. She believes that her personal e-mails were not kept, and she does not have any personal knowledge about the details of that process.Response: Secretary Clinton objects to Interrogatory No. 24 on the ground that it calls for information protected by the attorney-client privilege.Response: Secretary Clinton objects to Interrogatory No. 25 on the ground that it requests information that is outside the scope of permitted discovery for the reasons set forth in General Objection No. 5. Secretary Clinton further objects to Interrogatory No. 25 on the ground that the word ""management"" is vague. Secretary Clinton further objects to Interrogatory No. 25 insofar as it requests information related to alternate or replacement servers used after Secretary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, Secretary Clinton states that she does not recall having communications with Bryan Pagliano concerning or relating to the management, preservation, deletion, or destruction of any e-mails in her clintonemail.com email account.***We previously took the sworn testimony of Clinton's top aides, Cheryl Mills and Huma Abedin, as well as top State Department official Patrick Kennedy and former State IT employee Bryan Pagliano regarding the creation and operation of Clinton's non-government email system.We plan to depose John Bentel, the State Department's former director of Information Resource Management of the Executive Secretariat (""S/ES-IRM""), the office that handles information technology for the Office of the Secretary, on October 24, 2016.The American people now have a little more information directly from Hillary Clinton about her email practices. Our lawyers will review the responses closely and will soon decide our next steps.In the meantime, Mrs. Clinton's refusal to answer many of the questions in a clear and straightforward manner simply reflects her disdain for the rule of law.SIGN UP"

In 2014, the LTBI rate for Somali refugees declined to 30 percent, which still remains a very high rate, even among resettled refugees.The rates of LTBI among Somali refugees who arrived in Minnesota during this seven year period are significantly higher than LTBI rates for refugees reported in other states, which range from 12 percent in California to 35 percent in Vermont.In 2004, 34 percent of all arriving refugees in Minnesota tested positive for LTBI. In 2014, 22 percent of all arriving refugees in the state tested positive for LTBI.As a point of comparison, only four percent of the general population in the United States tests positive for latent TB infection. Five to ten percent of the general population that tests positive for LTBI develops active TB at some point in life, according to the Centers for Disease Control.The 296 cases of active TB diagnosed in Minnesota in the past five years among refugees is at a level that is ten times higher than any of the fourteen other states for which Breitbart News has been able to obtain data. (Thirty-six states have not made this data publicly available.)MDH confirmed the data Breitbart News reported, but blamed the ten times greater rate of active TB cases among refugees in the state on ""the American diet and lifestyle,"" as well as the state's superior tuberculosis reporting information system.""Oftentimes the reason that Minnesota reports TB and other infectious diseases at higher rates than other states is because we have a stellar system of surveillance and screening,"" the MDH said in a statement provided to Breitbart News. In other words, it may be nearly as bad in other states; they just aren't tracking it.But extraodordinarily high rates of latent TB infection among arriving refugees, and Somali refugees in particular, combined with relatively low completion of treatment for LTBI among those refugees who arrived in the state between 1990 and 2010, may be a more plausible explanation for why Minnesota's rate of active TB among refugees is ten times greater than any other state.As Breitbart News reported, a landmark 2013 study from the University of California at San Diego ""analyzed data from LTBI [latent tuberculosis infection] screening results of 4,280 refugees resettled in San Diego County between January 2010 and October 2012,"" and concluded that ""[t]he prevalence of LTBI was highest among refugees from sub-Saharan Africa (43 percent) and was associated with current smoking and having a clinical comorbidity that increases the risk for active tuberculosis.""Despite compelling evidence to the contrary that high rates of latent TB infection among arriving Somali refugees is the primary cause of heightened rates of active TB among the refugee communities in Minnesota, MDH remains unpersuaded of causality.Breitbart News asked MDH if it considers ""the American diet and lifestyle"" the most significant cause of other medical conditions that cause latent TB to activate among refugees, or if their pre-existing health conditions prior to arrival, such as high rates of latent TB infection, were a more significant cause.""We do not have sufficient data or information to assess whether development of risk factors for activation of latent TB occurred before or after U.S. arrival for Minnesota's foreign-born TB cases,"" MDH responded.""This statement by MDH seems to be an answer to an irrelevant question,"" Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, told Breitbart News, adding, ""The relevant facts are: TB was acquired in Somalia. The 'risk factor' for having active TB is the tubercle bacillus. People with latent TB have the tubercle bacillus. Anything that weakens the immune system can activate the TB. I know of no evidence that the American diet or lifestyle has anything to do with it. Malnutrition, immune-suppressing drugs, some other infection can do it. Maybe cold weather can.""""People with latent TB are a public health risk. They need a full course of treatment and periodic monitoring, as with chest x-rays. One case of active TB requires a huge investment of public health resources to find and test all contacts,"" Orient added.The entire MDH response states (emphasis added):The sentence you referenced in MDH's initial statement refers to the phenomenon described in peer-reviewed public health literature as the ""healthy immigrant paradox."" In general measures of population health, such as infant mortality, infant birth weight, and life-expectancy, immigrants overall tend to be healthier than those who were born in the United States. This is also true for prevalence of chronic diseases. This health advantage dissipates the longer immigrant groups have been in the United States. There are, of course, variations within sub-groups of immigrants, but this phenomenon is observed both in the United States and in other industrialized countries. While the phenomenon is well-defined, explanations for what causes it are varied. This article by Uretsky and Mathiesen (2007) provides a good explanation of the healthy immigrant paradox.Regarding tuberculosis, risk factors for activation of latent TB include several chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer, end-stage renal disease, and other immunocompromising conditions. We do not have sufficient data or information to assess whether development of risk factors for activation of latent TB occurred before or after U.S. arrival for Minnesota's foreign-born TB cases. The data MDH collects are on conditions present at or around the time of TB diagnosis.Please note about the study you cited: [Chronic Disease Prevalance of a Refugee Population in Dayton, OH]The study was not peer-reviewed literature, but was someone's thesis project from a university library archive and is specific to one geographic area, Dayton, OH. It is not representative of Minnesota's refugee population.Despite MDH's unwillingness to admit what common sense confirms, untreated LTBI among Minnesota's refugee population is a ticking TB time bomb that has been exploding in the state since 1993, and it may not be done causing damage. The potential that many of the thousands of refugees who arrived in Minnesota with LTBI since 1990 and have never been treated will develop into active TB cases remains a significant health concern for all Minnesotans.While the number of active TB cases reported in the United States declined for 22 consecutive years between 1993 until 2014, ""the incidence of TB in Minnesota increased throughout much of the 1990s and peaked at 239 TB cases (4.8 cases per 100,000 population) in 2001,"" MDH reported in 2005:The most distinguishing characteristic of the epidemiology of TB disease in Minnesota is the very large proportion of TB cases reported among foreign-born persons, which has averaged 81% over the past 5 years. In 2005, 173 (87%) new TB cases in Minnesota occurred in persons born outside the United States. This exceptionally high percentage of foreign-born TB cases reported in 2005 represents the largest proportion of foreign-born cases reported in Minnesota since 1992, when MDH began collecting data on TB case-patients' countries of birth. In contrast, 54% of TB cases reported nationwide in 2005 were foreign-born.The 173 foreign-born TB case-patients reported in Minnesota during 2005 represent 31 different countries of birth. The most common region of birth among foreign-born TB cases reported in 2005 was sub-Saharan Africa (58%), followed by South/Southeast Asia (24%)In a 2009 article published in Bildhaan: An International Journal of Somali Studies, author Amin Mohamed wrote:Minnesota's foreign-born population has increased significantly as refugees around the world are choosing to reside in the state. According to the Center for Immigration Studies report in December 2005, Minnesota's immigrant population increased from 261,000 in 2000 to 374,000 in 2005 (a 43.3% increase).The state also has one of the highest percentages of tuberculosis cases among foreign-born residents in the United States. The percentage of foreign-born persons' TB cases in Minnesota increased from 50% in 1995 to 87% in 2005....Among the foreign-born patients in Minnesota from 2001 through 2005, the largest percentage (34%) was born in Somalia.Though the foreign-born TB problem in Minnesota began around 1990, MDH did not begin publicly reporting LTBI rates among arriving refugees until 2004.An additional reason cited by the 2013 University of California at San Diego study for the risk of active TB posed by high rates of latent TB infection within the refugee community is the very low rates of completion of latent TB treatment programs among that group.The problem is particularly severe among refugees arriving from Sub-Saharan Africa, the study reports:In this study of LTBI prevalence based on interferon g release assays and LTBI treatment among refugees resettling in San Diego County between 2010 and 2012, refugees from sub-Saharan Africa had the highest prevalence of LTBI (43.1%) compared with refugees from the Middle East (18.3%) and Asia (19.0%). Despite the significantly higher odds of LTBI among refugees from sub-Saharan Africa, LTBI treatment initiation was significantly lower among these refugees than among refugees from the Middle East (60.5% and 78.6%, respectively; P <= .001). This is concerning because it reveals a missed opportunity to decrease the risk of progression to active TB among this high-risk group of refugees resettling in the United States. Treatment completion analysis was limited by small numbers but suggested that refugees from sub-Saharan Africa may also have lower treatment completion rates than refugees from the Middle East (71.4% and 86.2%, respectively; P = .51), although this was not statistically significant.The low treatment initiation among refugees from sub-Saharan Africa in this study is particularly alarming because refugees from this region of the world have been resettling in the United States since 1980. Although there is likely no single factor that accounts for the low treatment rates among this group of refugees, future research using focus groups among African refugees with LTBI could help understand the reasons for this disparity.MDH says that the treatment completion rate among all refugees has improved in recent years.The Minnesota Refugee Health Report for 2011 published by MDH reported that 90 percent of the 610 refugees who arrived in 2010, or 548, in need of LTBI therapy were placed on such therapy.Of those, 82 percent, or 451 out of 548, completed latent TB infection therapy. All told, 152 refugees who arrived in Minnesota in 2010 who tested positive for LTBI, however, received no treatment.The percentage of refugees who tested positive for LTBI and successfully completed latent TB infection therapy after being placed on it increased to 86 percent in 2014.Prior to 2010, however, the percentage of refugees who tested positive for LTBI who successfully completed therapy was apparently much lower. The objective for 2011 was only 55 percent, indicating that was a goal above what had been accomplished in the previous years.That suggests a fairly large population of refugees who arrived in the six year period between 2004 and 2009 for which we have data were never treated for LTBI and remain at risk for activation.A total of 8,056 refugees tested positive for LTBI in Minnesota during those six years.Assuming 90 percent of those initiated LTBI therapy, and 50 percent of those completed LTBI therapy, as many as 4,431 refugees who arrived in Minnesota between 2004 and 2009 have LTBI and remain at risk for developing active TB.Added to that are decades of refugees who arrived before Minnesota began reporting this data in 2004.In its statement to Breitbart News, MDH admitted:The data you are referring to, showing 50% of the 593 foreign born residents of Minnesota diagnosed with TB arrived as refugees, represents years 2010 - 2014. The majority of those refugees actually developed TB disease after being in Minnesota at least five years, and many had been in the US at least 10 years, so these are not new arrivals to the US.In other words, the majority of the 296 refugees diagnosed with active TB in Minnesota between 2010 and 2014 arrived in Minnesota prior to 2009, during the period when the state experienced very high rates of LTBI among arriving refugees, combined with much lower treatment rates for those refugees.Presumably, many of those refugees with LTBI still reside in Minnesota.Here's a summary of LTBI infection rates among refugees arriving in Minnesota between 2004 and 2014, as provided by MDH:In 2004, 34 percent of arriving refugees tested positive for LTBI in Minnesota. Fifty-five percent of refugees arriving in Minnesota whose country of origin was in Sub-Saharan Africa tested positive for LTBI.In 2005, 40 percent of arriving refugees tested positive for LTBI in Minnesota. Fifty-one percent of refugees arriving in Minnesota whose country of origin was in Sub-Saharan Africa tested positive for LTBI.In 2006, 46 percent of arriving refugees tested positive for LTBI in Minnesota. Forty-nine percent of refugees arriving in Minnesota whose country of origin was in Sub-Saharan Africa tested positive for LTBI.In 2007, 45 percent of arriving refugees tested positive for LTBI in Minnesota. Fifty percent of refugees arriving in Minnesota whose country of origin was in Sub-Saharan Africa tested positive for LTBI.In 2008, 30 percent of arriving refugees tested positive for LTBI in Minnesota. Forty-five percent of refugees arriving in Minnesota whose country of origin was in Sub-Saharan Africa tested positive for LTBI.In 2009, 30 percent of arriving refugees tested positive for LTBI in Minnesota. Forty-two percent of refugees arriving in Minnesota whose country of origin was in Sub-Saharan Africa tested positive for LTBI.In 2010, 28 percent of arriving refugees tested positive for LTBI in Minnesota. Forty percent of refugees arriving in Minnesota whose country of origin was in Sub-Saharan Africa tested positive for LTBI.In 2011, 22 percent of arriving refugees tested positive for LTBI in Minnesota. Thirty-six percent of refugees arriving in Minnesota whose country of origin was in Sub-Saharan Africa tested positive for LTBI.In 2012, 22 percent of arriving refugees tested positive for LTBI in Minnesota. Thirty percent of refugees arriving in Minnesota whose country of origin was in Sub-Saharan Africa tested positive for LTBI.In 2013, 22 percent of arriving refugees tested positive for LTBI in Minnesota. Thirty percent of refugees arriving in Minnesota whose country of origin was in Sub-Saharan Africa tested positive for LTBI.In 2014, 22 percent of arriving refugees tested positive for LTBI in Minnesota. Thirty percent of refugees arriving in Minnesota whose country of origin was in Sub-Saharan Africa tested positive for LTBI.In a 2015 study, several researchers at the Centers for Disease Control recommended that ""implementing LTBI [latent tuberculosis infection] screening and treatment for United States bound refugees from countries with high or moderate LTBI prevalence would potentially save millions of dollars and contribute to United States TB elimination goals.""""These estimates are conservative since secondary transmission from tuberculosis cases in the United States was not considered in the model,"" the authors note.The sentence you referenced in MDH's initial statement refers to the phenomenon described in peer-reviewed public health literature as the ""healthy immigrant paradox."" In general measures of population health, such as infant mortality, infant birth weight, and life-expectancy, immigrants overall tend to be healthier than those who were born in the United States.

""The President's press secretary doesn't speak for me,"" Pence says.""Truth is there's a lot of talk about rigged elections,"" Pence said to a crowd of around 700 gathered in Mason, Ohio. Pence's running mate Donald Trump has been warning Americans along the campaign trail that the system is ""rigged"" for Clinton. Pence continued, ""and I have no doubt the national media is trying to rig this election with their biased coverage.""Earnest told press during the Monday briefing that the White House is ""not at all"" concerned with voter fraud. ""Neither is Mike Pence, who is the second-highest ranking official of the Trump campaign,"" Earnest continued.The reporter that questioned Earnest cited reports out of Colorado of ""dead people voting, and ballot box stuffing, and people voting for family members, and people who are not eligible to vote somehow casting ballots for years."" Earnest deflected to speak of seven ""battleground states"" with Republican governors twice when the reporter asked specifically about Colorado, governed by Democrat Gov. John Hickenlooper.But at his Monday rally in Columbus, Ohio, Pence repeated what he said in Mason, ""I've got a news flash for you, the President's press secretary doesn't speak for me.""They're not worried about it because they deny it's happening, I'm not worried about it because I know the American people are not going to let it happen."" He then told all of those gathered that after they go out and tell somebody about his and Trump's message, he said he wanted them to go out and ""respectfully participate to ensure the integrity of our democracy.He again strongly encouraged the crowd to volunteer at the precinct level.In Mason, Pence said, ""If you're here at a rally and you've not yet volunteered to participate in the electoral process, by respectfully providing accountability at a polling place come election day, then you haven't yet done all that you can do."" He added that he's served as Indiana's governor and a congressman, but the first office he was elected to was precinct committeeman.""The right to vote is the bedrock of our democracy. It has been bought at two high a price. Voter fraud cannot be tolerated by anyone in this nation because it disenfranchises Republican, Independents, Democrats, conservatives and liberals in America,"" said Pence, ""do all you can to respectfully participate in the process and ensure the outcome, the outcome we can all be proud of.""""We need to recognize the vigilance is the price of freedom in an honest democracy,"" Pence said to hundreds more in Columbus, Ohio, just hours after speaking in Mason. ""There's a lot of talk about voter fraud, whether voter fraud happens out there anymore and the truth is, voter fraud is a violation of the right of every American, conservative, liberal, Republican, Democrat, Independent.""Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana They're not worried about it because they deny it's happening, I'm not worried about it because I know the American people are not going to let it happen.""

He also went to Keene, New Hampshire.The majority of Bill Clinton's message was upbeat and positive, although he did suggest that he is tired of hearing that ""America is going to Hell in a hand basket.""Clinton highlighted how important New Hampshire is in the election and he also recalled his own memories from when he was campaigning in the state in 1992. ""New Hampshire is a special place to me and my family for reasons that are obvious and some that aren't,"" he said. ""I have kept the friends I made here more than 25 years ago."" Bill Clinton went on to say ""not in all these years since I went to the White House -- that I don't wish I had one or two fall days in New Hampshire.""Like a good surrogate, Bill Clinton made the case for why his wife deserves the most important office in America. He also praised current President Barack Obama for his accomplishments during his last eight years as president. ""He saved the auto industry, avoided a depression, passed the Dodd-Frank law,"" Clinton said.The health care bill has given 29 million of us health insurance and 100 percent of us are better off because we can't be denied health insurance for pre-existing conditions. You cannot give this country's future away to people who think anger is better than answers, that endless conflict is better than cooperation, and that the path forward in the world is walls not bridges, you can't do it - it's your life.Clinton encouraged the people of New Hampshire to think about which candidate is going to be better to drive America forward into 2017. He insisted that Trump will drive America off a cliff with his ""hell in a hand basket"" rhetoric.In an effort to bring unity back to America after this very decisive election season, Bill Clinton suggested, ""One of the things I think we have to do when this election is over -- every one of us, each in our own way -- is not treat the people on the other side the way they and their candidate have treated us. We should reach out.""In closing, Bill Clinton described how Hillary Rodham Clinton would be a representative for all Americans and she will take America to a new place. ""So if you give her the keys to the truck, what she will do is open the back, put everyone on and drive us to a new mountaintop - that is what New Hampshire can do, God Bless you.""The health care bill has given 29 million of us health insurance and 100 percent of us are better off because we can't be denied health insurance for pre-existing conditions.

Current policy is not even achieving decarbonisation. Whatever your views on the urgency of reducing emissions, the policy of subsidizing renewable energy is not achieving it.Switching to biodiesel or ethanol actually increases emissions. So does burning wood in power stations. So does solar power in cloudy Germany. So do wind farms because they prevent the replacement of coal by gas or nuclear.In 2012 Bjorn Lomborg calculated that 20 years of climate policy had reduced global emissions by less than 1 percent. During that time the world had spent more than a trillion dollars to subsidise wind and solar power, yet between them they had still not achieved 1% of world energy provision. In this country, they have just passed 2%.In Germany, a 20% increase in renewables between 1999 and 2014 has resulted in no change in emissions at all.Testifying to Congress in 2014, Professor Judith Curry, chair of Earth Sciences at Georgia Tech University said:""Motivated by the precautionary principle to avoid dangerous anthropogenic climate change, attempts to modify the climate through reducing CO2 emissions may turn out to be futile.""Savour that one, greentards. All those bat-chomping, bird-slicing eco-crucifixes you've erected; all those banks of stupid solar panels turning agricultural land into a scene out of a bad sci-fi movie; all those forests you've chopped down for ""biofuel""; all those old people you've forced to die in fuel poverty; all those natives you've displaced to grow carbon offsets; all those trillions of dollars which could have been spent on something beneficial - healthcare, education, anti-terrorism intelligence, clean water supplies for the one billion people without access to them... - have instead been squandered on white elephant projects which do precisely zilch for the environment.Greenies don't like hearing this kind of home truth which, of course, was why in their usual open-minded, free-speech-cherishing way they tried to get last night's lecture cancelled. Here, for example, is a delightfully pompous, priggish intervention from Joanna Haigh, a physics professor from Imperial College, London, often used by the BBC to endorse the alarmist ""consensus"". (And who, in the alarmist way, is more than happy to cherry-pick her data in order to prop up her scientifically bankrupt thesis.)Joanna Haigh, Royal Society fellow and council member who attended the meeting, told DeSmog UK: ""The Royal Society has decided that cancelling the booking would give the event an unwarranted higher profile.""She added that ""some scientist experts will attend the meeting and keep check on the accuracy of the statements.""The arrogance and presumption of it! This puffed-up missy would seriously have us believe that the ""science"" only exists on her alarmist side of the argument and that the likes of Matt Ridley - who, by the way, has a perfectly respectable PhD in Zoology from Oxford, and is one of the world's bestselling science authors - can only make their case by playing fast and loose with the facts.Pot. Kettle. Black.What a bunch of disgraceful, money-grubbing, charlatans the climate alarmists are. They are to the scientific method what gangs of Muslim taxi drivers in Rotherham are to 13-year-old white schoolgirls.Obviously Matt Ridley - or Viscount Ridley, to give him his proper title - can't say this sort of thing because he's a member of the House of Lords and has to rub shoulders with alarmist scientists and greenie Ecommunists and BBC journalists and make out that actually he has a modicum of respect for their dodgy science and their nauseating eco-fascistic Weltanschauung.I can though.

But they're wrong. SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""Teflon Don,"" as Trump has been called many times, is back on track after the roughest patch of his campaign yet heading into the Las Vegas debate on Wednesday night-all while the Institutional Left propping up Hillary Clinton is withering under scrutiny. A new round of polls have put a spring in Trump's step, as he has reaffirmed his lead in Ohio according to the latest CNN/ORC poll from the Buckeye State and remains within he margin of error right behind Clinton in the latest CNN/ORC polls from Nevada and North Carolina. Quinnipiac shows Trump just outside the margin of error right behind Clinton in Florida, and a few points outside the margin of error in Pennsylvania while trailing a bit more but within earshot in Colorado. He has retaken the lead nationally in the daily Los Angeles Times/USC poll, after falling into a tie with Clinton, and remains close in other battlegrounds like New Hampshire. In fact, the Live Free or Die state's latest polling show Trump moving up four points in the latest WBUR survey compared to that firm's previous results--meaning Trump has actually, despite what the media says, trended upwards since the second presidential debate and the release of a video that sent his campaign into disarray right before the battle he won in St. Louis.Before bringing two cute children up on stage with him at his Green Bay, Wisconsin, rally on Monday night, Trump reveled in his comeback.""Those polls were great today, but they're also showing that there's like an undercurrent that they can't poll,"" Trump said. Remember when I was in the primaries? How's he doing in such and such--well it looks like he won't win that state. Then the next day you like win in a landslide, but we'll take it any way. I guess it's like people don't like to say they're voting for Trump, which is ok, we'll take it any way we get it. Do you agree? We'll take it any way we get it. But there's a big, big undercurrent out there.WATCH TRUMP'S RALLY IN GREEN BAY
Meanwhile, as allegations from a variety of women who say Trump groped them surface now--decades after the alleged incidents occurred just weeks before an election with little to no proof, and sometimes contradictory witnesses--the mainstream media's overdrive play against Trump, backed by the Clinton campaign, seems to be backfiring. Trump's team is now back on the offensive against the media and political establishment as a whole, including Hillary Clinton.""You look at what is the media covering--the media covers,"" retired U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, a Trump surrogate, said on stage at Trump's Monday evening rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin, as the crowd booed the media. ""Exactly. They know it. They know it.""
The crowd broke into a collective chant, shouting at the mainstream media reporters from CNN and other outlets at that point: ""Tell The Truth! Tell The Truth! Tell The Truth! Tell The Truth!""A grinning Gen. Flynn nodded along. ""There's a great quote--you know what the truth fears?"" he asked the crowd of thousands there to see Trump. ""The truth fears no questions. The truth fears no questions. So when you tell the truth, you don't have to worry about what you're going to say, unlike Hillary Clinton who does not know how to tell the truth. She can't tell the truth. She doesn't know the difference between a lie and the truth.""Later, before he rapped his rousing introductory speech of Trump, Flynn detailed how ""there is an assault"" that the media is levying on behalf of Hillary Clinton against Donald Trump.""There is a barrage attack going on in the media right now against Donald Trump,"" Flynn said. ""It's unbelievable.""The crowd booed the reporters in the back of the room, as Flynn explained how the media operates.""The folks that are here, they're here like a soldier--they're not in charge,"" Flynn said. ""But I'm going to tell you those that run these organizations, it's unbelievable.""Then Flynn cited the new report from the Center for Public Integrity that detailed how the majority of the media is officially backing Hillary Clinton for president--with financial contributions.""Today we found out 96--almost 97--percent of donations coming out of the journalist community go to Hillary Clinton,"" Flynn said. Almost 97 percent. Unbelievable. It's unbelievable. It's 96.6 percent of the journalist community, the donations go to Hillary Clinton. So when you're talking about a liberal bias in the mainstream media, it's for real. It's for real. So what we ask and what I want, what I want is honesty from people. If you're going to deal with me, what you see is what you get out of Mike Flynn in this case. OK? And we have got to be honest with the American public.But it's not just what Flynn was talking about there in Green Bay or that Center for Public Integrity report. WikiLeaks has now published thousands of pages of emails from the account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta that prove the entire institutions of the mainstream media is in the pocket of Hillary Clinton and her campaign. A new tranche of emails published on Tuesday show Politico's Glenn Thrush letting Podesta himself edit an article he was writing about him, contrary to Politico's editorial policies. When Ken Vogel, a different Politico reporter, was caught doing the same thing in emails published over the summer in the Democratic National Committee (DNC) email release that led to the resignation of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) as that organization's chairwoman, Politico apologized for the practice and Politico said that sharing articles prior to publication with subjects was not its policy. But Thrush has been defiant, refusing to apologize, and admitting that he has violated Politico policy many more times than this instance.Absolutely.

Meanwhile, multiple other reporters, anchors, editors, producers and journalists media wide are implicated in the scandal, having dined at the home of a top Clinton staffer days before she launched her presidential campaign and sent the Clintons questions prior to interviews and even presidential debates. The problem is so incessant and the corruption is so heavily rooted throughout the establishment, the proprietor and founder of the Drudge Report Matt Drudge noted on Twitter, that the media cannot ""cover WikiLeaks Podesta shitstorm - because so much of it involves them!"" Drudge Tweeted that it will end up taking a full ""generation to recover from this corruption.""Media CAN'T cover WikiLeaks Podesta shitstorm - because so much of it involves them!

They've got to start talking about WikiLeaks--they got to start talking about the things that are going on. Hillary even got the questions and answers--""The crowd broke out again into another chant at the reporters in the back, yelling: ""TELL THE TRUTH! TELL THE TRUTH! TELL THE TRUTH!""A smiling Trump gave his supporters a big thumbs up before he continued: ""We need some truth.""""We need truth,"" he said. ""We do need truth. You know, to Make America Great Again we do need some truth from these people because they poison the minds of voters because not everybody understands what's happening and by the time they do it might be too late. They're poisoning the minds of voters.""Trump continued after a protester interrupted.""Hillary even got the questions and answers ahead of a major debate--how do you do that?"" Trump noted. ""Think of it: Nobody made a big deal. Nobody even knows about it. She got the questions in advance to essentially a debate. Can you imagine if Donald Trump got the questions in advance? You know what they'd do? They'd reinvent the electric chair, that's what they'd do.""Meanwhile, James O'Keefe's Project Veritas uncovered in his team's latest investigation serious corruption throughout the institutional left, from the top of Clinton's campaign with campaign manager Robby Mook on down through a field director at the leftwing grassroots group Americans United for Change. That field director, Scott Foval, has been fired from the organization just hours after O'Keefe's latest video, but other actors throughout their astroturf movement--at the Clinton campaign, grassroots progressive organizers on the ground, staffers at the Democratic National Committee and the lead activists at the Democracy Partners organization that serves as the beating heart of the radical left--remain intact for now.Wrap it all together with revelations coming out of the FBI that during the investigation into Hillary Clinton's illicit home brew email server, the FBI considered a ""quid pro quo"" with the State Department regarding classification of Hillary Clinton's emails after the fact. Despite her claims to the contrary, on her insecure private email system while Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton regularly sent and received classified information multiple times while it was classified putting that information at significant risk. Donald Trump and his campaign have called for the resignation of Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy, and argue it casts doubt on the FBI director James Comey's decision to not recommend indictment of Hillary Clinton in the matter.All of that--from what has been uncovered in the WikiLeaks scandal to the O'Keefe videos to the quid pro quo discoveries from the FBI investigation, and more--paints what Trump says is a picture of a ""rigged"" system, and have stalled what the media thought was Clinton's inevitable ascendency into the White House.Trump's challenge in Wednesday evening's debate with Clinton--their third and final showdown--and in the days between then and election day on Nov. 8 is clear. He aims to remain on message, and frame his campaign as one against the entire political class. He is unafraid to run against all of Washington, D.C.--both political parties, the entire failed political institution, the media and all powers that be--and whether he can deliver that message around the corrupted media directly to voters remains to be seen.""You have the disappearance of 13 iPhones, many of them whacked with a hammer--who here has gotten rid of your phone and hit it with a hammer?"" Trump asked his crowd in Green Bay. ""How many people? Anybody? Nobody?""As one person raised his hand, Trump joked: ""Oh I want to find out the business that guy's in.""""But she whacked them with a hammer, 13 of them,"" Trump said of Clinton's destruction of her cell phones. ""Two boxes--I don't know if you even know this--two boxes of email evidence has gone missing two weeks ago, and the destruction of laptops in a secret deal with the FBI. Remember also that Crooked Hillary lied under oath to Congress saying she never sent or received classified information on her insecure server.""
As the crowd chanted ""Lock Her Up! Lock Her Up! Lock Her Up!"" Trump continued.""And she pretended not to know that the letter 'C' meant confidential information that was classified,"" Trump said. Hillary then told the FBI she couldn't remember 39 times--bad memory--and then in her written testimony last week under oath she couldn't remember approximately 21 times. Can anyone believe the stuff they say? I'll tell you, look, I'll tell you: This is one of the great miscarriages of justice in the history of this country. What's happened to the Department of Justice, what's happened to the FBI is so sad.

But there's a big, big undercurrent out there.

Almost 97 percent. Unbelievable. It's unbelievable. It's 96.6 percent of the journalist community, the donations go to Hillary Clinton. So when you're talking about a liberal bias in the mainstream media, it's for real. It's for real. So what we ask and what I want, what I want is honesty from people. If you're going to deal with me, what you see is what you get out of Mike Flynn in this case. OK? And we have got to be honest with the American public.

Hillary then told the FBI she couldn't remember 39 times--bad memory--and then in her written testimony last week under oath she couldn't remember approximately 21 times. Can anyone believe the stuff they say? I'll tell you, look, I'll tell you: This is one of the great miscarriages of justice in the history of this country. What's happened to the Department of Justice, what's happened to the FBI is so sad.

SIGN UPNEW YORK CITY -- Many professional political prognosticators predict Hillary Clinton will win next month's presidential election over GOP nominee Donald Trump. But they're wrong. ""Teflon Don,"" as Trump has been called many times, is back on track after the roughest patch of his campaign yet heading into the Las Vegas debate on Wednesday night-all while the Institutional Left propping up Hillary Clinton is withering under scrutiny. A new round of polls have put a spring in Trump's step, as he has reaffirmed his lead in Ohio according to the latest CNN/ORC poll from the Buckeye State and remains within he margin of error right behind Clinton in the latest CNN/ORC polls from Nevada and North Carolina. Quinnipiac shows Trump just outside the margin of error right behind Clinton in Florida, and a few points outside the margin of error in Pennsylvania while trailing a bit more but within earshot in Colorado. He has retaken the lead nationally in the daily Los Angeles Times/USC poll, after falling into a tie with Clinton, and remains close in other battlegrounds like New Hampshire. In fact, the Live Free or Die state's latest polling show Trump moving up four points in the latest WBUR survey compared to that firm's previous results--meaning Trump has actually, despite what the media says, trended upwards since the second presidential debate and the release of a video that sent his campaign into disarray right before the battle he won in St. Louis.Before bringing two cute children up on stage with him at his Green Bay, Wisconsin, rally on Monday night, Trump reveled in his comeback.""Those polls were great today, but they're also showing that there's like an undercurrent that they can't poll,"" Trump said. Remember when I was in the primaries? How's he doing in such and such--well it looks like he won't win that state. Then the next day you like win in a landslide, but we'll take it any way. I guess it's like people don't like to say they're voting for Trump, which is ok, we'll take it any way we get it. Do you agree? We'll take it any way we get it. But there's a big, big undercurrent out there.WATCH TRUMP'S RALLY IN GREEN BAY
Meanwhile, as allegations from a variety of women who say Trump groped them surface now--decades after the alleged incidents occurred just weeks before an election with little to no proof, and sometimes contradictory witnesses--the mainstream media's overdrive play against Trump, backed by the Clinton campaign, seems to be backfiring. Trump's team is now back on the offensive against the media and political establishment as a whole, including Hillary Clinton.""You look at what is the media covering--the media covers,"" retired U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, a Trump surrogate, said on stage at Trump's Monday evening rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin, as the crowd booed the media. ""Exactly. They know it. They know it.""
The crowd broke into a collective chant, shouting at the mainstream media reporters from CNN and other outlets at that point: ""Tell The Truth! Tell The Truth! Tell The Truth! Tell The Truth!""A grinning Gen. Flynn nodded along. ""There's a great quote--you know what the truth fears?"" he asked the crowd of thousands there to see Trump. ""The truth fears no questions. The truth fears no questions. So when you tell the truth, you don't have to worry about what you're going to say, unlike Hillary Clinton who does not know how to tell the truth. She can't tell the truth. She doesn't know the difference between a lie and the truth.""Later, before he rapped his rousing introductory speech of Trump, Flynn detailed how ""there is an assault"" that the media is levying on behalf of Hillary Clinton against Donald Trump.""There is a barrage attack going on in the media right now against Donald Trump,"" Flynn said. ""It's unbelievable.""The crowd booed the reporters in the back of the room, as Flynn explained how the media operates.""The folks that are here, they're here like a soldier--they're not in charge,"" Flynn said. ""But I'm going to tell you those that run these organizations, it's unbelievable.""Then Flynn cited the new report from the Center for Public Integrity that detailed how the majority of the media is officially backing Hillary Clinton for president--with financial contributions.""Today we found out 96--almost 97--percent of donations coming out of the journalist community go to Hillary Clinton,"" Flynn said. Almost 97 percent. Unbelievable. It's unbelievable. It's 96.6 percent of the journalist community, the donations go to Hillary Clinton. So when you're talking about a liberal bias in the mainstream media, it's for real. It's for real. So what we ask and what I want, what I want is honesty from people. If you're going to deal with me, what you see is what you get out of Mike Flynn in this case. OK? And we have got to be honest with the American public.But it's not just what Flynn was talking about there in Green Bay or that Center for Public Integrity report. WikiLeaks has now published thousands of pages of emails from the account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta that prove the entire institutions of the mainstream media is in the pocket of Hillary Clinton and her campaign. A new tranche of emails published on Tuesday show Politico's Glenn Thrush letting Podesta himself edit an article he was writing about him, contrary to Politico's editorial policies. When Ken Vogel, a different Politico reporter, was caught doing the same thing in emails published over the summer in the Democratic National Committee (DNC) email release that led to the resignation of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) as that organization's chairwoman, Politico apologized for the practice and Politico said that sharing articles prior to publication with subjects was not its policy. But Thrush has been defiant, refusing to apologize, and admitting that he has violated Politico policy many more times than this instance.The WikiLeaks-published Podesta emails show that New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman was considered a ""friendly journalist"" who ""never disappointed"" the Clinton campaign. Meanwhile, multiple other reporters, anchors, editors, producers and journalists media wide are implicated in the scandal, having dined at the home of a top Clinton staffer days before she launched her presidential campaign and sent the Clintons questions prior to interviews and even presidential debates. The problem is so incessant and the corruption is so heavily rooted throughout the establishment, the proprietor and founder of the Drudge Report Matt Drudge noted on Twitter, that the media cannot ""cover WikiLeaks Podesta shitstorm - because so much of it involves them!"" Drudge Tweeted that it will end up taking a full ""generation to recover from this corruption.""Trump himself went further than Flynn.""The media is an extension of the Clinton campaign as WikiLeaks have proven,"" Trump said Monday night. ""They don't talk about WikiLeaks, they just keep talking about Trump, Trump, Trump. They want to put nice sexy headlines up even though nothing happened, nothing took place, even though it's a total fabrication. They've got to start talking about WikiLeaks--they got to start talking about the things that are going on. Hillary even got the questions and answers--""The crowd broke out again into another chant at the reporters in the back, yelling: ""TELL THE TRUTH! TELL THE TRUTH! TELL THE TRUTH!""A smiling Trump gave his supporters a big thumbs up before he continued: ""We need some truth.""""We need truth,"" he said. ""We do need truth. You know, to Make America Great Again we do need some truth from these people because they poison the minds of voters because not everybody understands what's happening and by the time they do it might be too late. They're poisoning the minds of voters.""Trump continued after a protester interrupted.""Hillary even got the questions and answers ahead of a major debate--how do you do that?"" Trump noted. ""Think of it: Nobody made a big deal. Nobody even knows about it. She got the questions in advance to essentially a debate. Can you imagine if Donald Trump got the questions in advance? You know what they'd do? They'd reinvent the electric chair, that's what they'd do.""Meanwhile, James O'Keefe's Project Veritas uncovered in his team's latest investigation serious corruption throughout the institutional left, from the top of Clinton's campaign with campaign manager Robby Mook on down through a field director at the leftwing grassroots group Americans United for Change. That field director, Scott Foval, has been fired from the organization just hours after O'Keefe's latest video, but other actors throughout their astroturf movement--at the Clinton campaign, grassroots progressive organizers on the ground, staffers at the Democratic National Committee and the lead activists at the Democracy Partners organization that serves as the beating heart of the radical left--remain intact for now.Wrap it all together with revelations coming out of the FBI that during the investigation into Hillary Clinton's illicit home brew email server, the FBI considered a ""quid pro quo"" with the State Department regarding classification of Hillary Clinton's emails after the fact. Despite her claims to the contrary, on her insecure private email system while Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton regularly sent and received classified information multiple times while it was classified putting that information at significant risk. Donald Trump and his campaign have called for the resignation of Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy, and argue it casts doubt on the FBI director James Comey's decision to not recommend indictment of Hillary Clinton in the matter.All of that--from what has been uncovered in the WikiLeaks scandal to the O'Keefe videos to the quid pro quo discoveries from the FBI investigation, and more--paints what Trump says is a picture of a ""rigged"" system, and have stalled what the media thought was Clinton's inevitable ascendency into the White House.Trump's challenge in Wednesday evening's debate with Clinton--their third and final showdown--and in the days between then and election day on Nov. 8 is clear. He aims to remain on message, and frame his campaign as one against the entire political class. He is unafraid to run against all of Washington, D.C.--both political parties, the entire failed political institution, the media and all powers that be--and whether he can deliver that message around the corrupted media directly to voters remains to be seen.""You have the disappearance of 13 iPhones, many of them whacked with a hammer--who here has gotten rid of your phone and hit it with a hammer?"" Trump asked his crowd in Green Bay. ""How many people? Anybody? Nobody?""As one person raised his hand, Trump joked: ""Oh I want to find out the business that guy's in.""""But she whacked them with a hammer, 13 of them,"" Trump said of Clinton's destruction of her cell phones. ""Two boxes--I don't know if you even know this--two boxes of email evidence has gone missing two weeks ago, and the destruction of laptops in a secret deal with the FBI. Remember also that Crooked Hillary lied under oath to Congress saying she never sent or received classified information on her insecure server.""
As the crowd chanted ""Lock Her Up! Lock Her Up! Lock Her Up!"" Trump continued.""And she pretended not to know that the letter 'C' meant confidential information that was classified,"" Trump said. Hillary then told the FBI she couldn't remember 39 times--bad memory--and then in her written testimony last week under oath she couldn't remember approximately 21 times. Can anyone believe the stuff they say? I'll tell you, look, I'll tell you: This is one of the great miscarriages of justice in the history of this country. What's happened to the Department of Justice, what's happened to the FBI is so sad.

The resulting death threats have led to beefing up the UNESCO chief's security.In a statement distancing herself from the resolutions, Bokova wrote ""nowhere more than in Jerusalem do Jewish, Christian and Muslim heritage and traditions share space.""Earlier Monday, Cohen unsuccessfully attempted to lobby the UNESCO board to delay ratifying the resolution.Mexico's ambassador to UNESCO Andres Roemer, who is Jewish, walked out of the vote in Paris in an apparent protest against his country's support of the resolution. Cohen urged the ambassador not to follow through on his decision to resign, telling him he is needed as a friend of Israel.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the resolution a ""theater of the absurd.""Twenty-four countries voted in favor of the resolution while six, including the U.S., Germany and Britain, voted against and another 26 abstained.Education Minister Naftali Bennett called the resolution a denial of history that ""gives a boost to terrorism.""

Dolan of New York, chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' (USCCB) Committee on Pro-Life Activities, condemned attempts by the group to deceive the public through an ad campaign calling for taxpayer funding of abortion in the name of the Catholic faith.""As the U.S. Catholic bishops have stated for many years, the use of the name 'Catholic' as a platform to promote the taking of innocent human life is offensive not only to Catholics, but to all who expect honesty and forthrightness in public discourse,"" he said.""CFC is not affiliated with the Catholic Church in any way. It has no membership, and clearly does not speak for the faithful. It is funded by powerful private foundations to promote abortion as a method of population control,"" he added.This is not the first such organization set up for the express purpose of undermining Catholic teaching and confusing the faithful.Hacked emails released by Wikileaks last week revealed that top members of the Hillary Clinton campaign have been engaged in efforts to subvert Catholic moral teaching through just this sort of organization. Campaign chief John Podesta boasted that he had set up two Catholic dummy associations for this purpose: Catholics United and Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good.The email feed, titled ""opening for a Catholic spring?"" suggested that the phony Catholic groups could ""plant the seeds of the revolution"" and so bring an end to ""a middle ages dictatorship"" as well as ushering in an age of ""gender equality"" in the Church.In response, Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput wrote a scathing essay decrying the deceptive ploys and anti-Catholicism of the Democratic Party as well as characterizing Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton as a ""scheming, robotic liar with a lifelong appetite for power and an entourage riddled with anti-Catholic bigots.""The Archbishop further suggested that as bad as things have been under President Obama, a Hillary presidency could make them worse still.Despite the immense ""cultural damage"" brought about by the current White House, Chaput writes, with the ""contemptuously anti-Catholic emails"" of Hillary's campaign team, ""bad can always get worse."" In fact, Chaput had written earlier, in the view of many people, Hillary ""should be under criminal indictment.""Chaput quotes at length an email he received from a non-Catholic attorney, who assured him that these ""bigots are actively strategizing how to shape Catholicism not to be Catholic.""""They are, at the very core, trying to turn religion to their secular view of right and wrong consistent with their politics,"" he quotes. ""We have political actors trying to orchestrate a coup to destroy Catholic values, and they even analogize their takeover to a coup in the Middle East, which amplifies their bigotry and hatred of the Church.""Follow Thomas D.

""My only goal in talking to the reporters was to protect American interests and lives.""Cartwright's guilty plea was for his false statements to FBI agents, not for speaking to the reporters, said Cartwright's attorney Gregory Craig, of Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom, in a separate statement: ""His effort to prevent publication of information that might harm American lives of national security does not constitute a violation of any law.""Federal prosecutors declined to comment on the hearing. A false statements conviction carries a maximum prison sentence of five years, but prosecutors and Cartwright's attorneys agreed his offense merited a sentence ranging from zero to six months.Reuters and several other news outlets have previously reported that Stuxnet was developed jointly by U.S. and Israeli forces. Both the U.S. and Israel have never publicly admitted responsibility for Stuxnet.Stuxnet was a sophisticated computer virus deployed covertly in 2009 and 2010 to sabotage Iran's nuclear program. The worm, parts of which surfaced publicly in 2010 due to a programing error that allowed it to spread across the open internet, is believed to have destroyed a thousand or more centrifuges that were enriching uranium.Cartwright has long been the target of a Justice Department probe investigating the source of leaks about Stuxnet to the New York Times.U.S. District Judge Richard Leon on Monday tentatively scheduled Cartwright's sentencing for Jan. 17, 2017, and acknowledged that part of the sentencing might be closed to allow for discussion of classified information.SIGN UP"
