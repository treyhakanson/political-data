Naumann asks. And if abortion is killing an innocent human being, why does Kaine publicly support it?""This is where the reproductive choice euphemism breaks apart,"" the Archbishop said. ""Does anyone really have the choice to end another human being's life?""Responding to Senator Kaine's stated fear that if abortion were made illegal again, our prisons would be teeming with post-abortive women, Naumann called up the historical record.""Before the late 1960s when abortion was illegal in every state, except for the life-of-the-mother cases, it is difficult to find a single instance of a woman imprisoned for abortion,"" he said. ""The laws were enforced against the abortionists. Our own legal experience shows clearly that it is possible to develop public policies aimed at protecting children, not punishing women.""Kaine goes beyond mere acquiescence and ""appears eager to champion not only maintaining the status quo, but actually expanding abortion rights,"" the Archbishop noted.Naumann also berated Kaine for supporting efforts ""to coerce the Little Sisters of the Poor and other faith-based ministries to violate their conscience,"" to put small business owners ""out of business with crippling fines if they decline to participate in same-sex marriage ceremonies"" and ""to force every American taxpayer to help fund abortion.""At the conclusion of his column, Archbishop Naumann encouraged Catholic voters ""to think not only of the candidate, but who they will appoint to key Cabinet and other powerful government positions if he or she becomes president.""""We are choosing not just a president, but an entire administration,"" he said.Follow Thomas D.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERClinton's campaign manager Robby Mook said Clinton ""shouldn't have Israel at public events,"" while Jake Sullivan, Clinton's top foreign policy adviser, disagreed, advising Clinton that her central message should include ""a sentence on standing up for our allies and our values, including Israel and other fellow democracies, and confronting terrorists and dictators with strength and cunning.""In the May 2017 discussion, Mandy Grunwald, Clinton's senior communications adviser, responded to Sullivan: ""I though(t) this was largely for her TP (talking points) with public events not fundraisers. Do we need Israel etc for that?""Sullivan replied: ""We def(initely) need the etc. I think good to have Israel too.""Clinton's chief strategist Joel Beneson then asked if there was any sense in mentioning Israel: ""Why would we call out Israel in public events now? The only voters elevating FP (foreign policy) at all are Republican primary voters. To me we deal with this in stride when and if we are asked about FP.""Sullivan responded by reminding the team that ""She was Secretary of State.""Campaign manager Mook disagreed: ""I'm w(ith) Joel. We shouldn't have Israel at public events. Especially dem (Democratic) activists.""Sullivan acquiesced, writing: ""I won't fall on sword over Israel but we need more than climate in that paragraph.""Clinton's director of speechwriting Dan Schwerin suggested the following:What about this as a base, and then she can drop in Israel when she's with donors: Fourth and finally, we have to protect our country from the global threats that we see, from terrorists to dictators to diseases - and the ones that are still over the horizon. We have to assert confident American leadership to shape global events rather than be shaped by them. That includes taking on global warming and those who continue to deny that it exists. And it means always standing up for our allies and our values, especially our fellow democracies.In another email exchange, Clinton's team discussed a draft of her speech at the Jewish Federation of Des Moines in January. The team considered whether to infer that Bernie Sanders' position on Iran may put Israel in danger.Speechwriter Schwerin asked the campaign team to ""let me know if we should add a Bernie hit on Iran in here. Right now it's pretty straight.""Sarah Bard, Clinton's Jewish Outreach director said she thought it was best to ""not name him specifically. Reference ideology, without using the exact language Bernie used, and making it very clear what she's referencing. Something like, 'those who suggest that we looks past human rights violations, blatant disregard of international law and ... by the leading state sponsor of terrorism, Iran, are dangerously naive or who largely uninformed about how the world works.'""Foreign policy adviser Sullivan warned that it was best not to use the words ""naive or uninformed"" and ultimately suggested that ""I would lay off.""In another instance in which Clinton was advised not to sound ""naive,"" was in her November 2015 column on the two-state solution in the Forward.Stuart Eizenstat, a former US diplomat and close associate of the Clintons, wrote:""Attached are my edits to an excellent draft. We must be careful on not seeming naive on the two-state solution. She must support it, but suggest initial confidence building steps now, which is all that can be expected, to set a stage for broader negotiations.""What about this as a base, and then she can drop in Israel when she's with donors: Fourth and finally, we have to protect our country from the global threats that we see, from terrorists to dictators to diseases - and the ones that are still over the horizon. We have to assert confident American leadership to shape global events rather than be shaped by them. That includes taking on global warming and those who continue to deny that it exists.

Snowden commented, ""I, sitting at my desk [could] wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a federal judge or even the president, if I had a personal email.""According to the new records uncovered by the ACLU, police departments across the U.S. are monitoring Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram social media accounts through real-time, location-based user data analytic tools developed by Chicago tech firm Geofeedia, including ""Geofeed."" The ACLU report states that ""we have seen marketed to law enforcement as a tool to monitor activists and protesters.""The Northern California ACLU office claims that they first learned about law enforcement ""agreements with Geofeedia from responses to federal and state Freedom of Information Act public records requests to 63 California law enforcement agencies."" The records revealed a rapid growth in social media surveillance with ""little-to-no debate or oversight.""As ACLU representatives combed through ""thousands of pages of documents,"" they learned through police email exchanges that Geofeedia representatives marketed their services to law enforcement based on ""special access to Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram user data.""One message detailed special arrangements that Geofeedia had negotiated with Twitter and Instagram to access their ""Firehose"" to gain unlimited access to all user data.Geofeedia also trumpeted that they had just entered into a ""confidential legally binding agreement with Facebook"" that will allow ""reactivating more and more data to Geofeedia throughout our partnership."" The company added, ""this data is far more data than any other competing data mining software has to offer when it comes to Facebook.""As an example of the breadth and intrusiveness of its analytic tools provided to law enforcement, Geofeedia revealed how they ""covered Ferguson/Mike Brown nationally with great success.""After Michael Brown was shot and killed by a white police officer two years ago in Ferguson, Mo., Geofeedia was able to monitor the social media activities of Darren Seals, who was one of the most vocal activists leading protests across the city. Seals rallied a boycott of Democratic candidates in local elections after he said they failed to protect black lives. When a grand jury later declined to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, the press reported Seals holding Brown's mother in his arms as she sobbed.Darren Seals was found shot dead in a burning car on September 7, 2016 just outside Ferguson, according to reports by the St. Louis County Police Department.The ACLU report claims that nearly 500 law enforcement agencies -- including the Oakland Police Department -- gained access to user data from at least eight social media sources through Geofeedia.Malkia Cyril, executive director of the Center for Media Justice activist group in Oakland, told the San Francisco Chronicle, ""At every protest, we assume we're being spied on, because we know we are."" She added: ""We assume whatever surveillance tools are at the disposal of our local police department, they're being used.""Although Geofeed data can allow law enforcement agencies to track protests as they happen and identify individuals involved, the ACLU report did not specify which data is being accessed by different police departments and how that data was used.The extent to which police can use mass surveillance is a matter of ethical and legal dispute. But with social media companies selling their users' most intimate secrets to advertisers for big bucks, it should not be surprising that law enforcement would become another major buyer of data to monitor individuals, groups and even entire cities.Breitbart News contacted several conservative leaders to obtain their input on the ACLU report. Paul Preston of the nationally syndicated ""Agenda 21 Radio Show"" commented that this issue should also be of major concern to conservatives and libertarians.Following the ACLU report, Twitter, Facebook and their Instagram division have severed their contractual relationships with Geofeedia.SIGN UP"	['Paul']	[]

It's about a way of thinking and a way of living. And I really believe that's what this is about,"" Clinton said of his wife's campaign slogan.""I know what 'great again' means,"" Clinton said, referring to his upbringing in the rural south. ""It means vote for me and I will make all your problems go away by giving you the economy you used to have, and oh, by the way, I will move you back up to the first spot on the social totem pole."" Bill Clinton went on to say that ""Hillary Clinton would do away with the social totem pole entirely.""In keeping with the upbeat message he gave Monday during his New Hampshire campaign stops, Bill Clinton promised, ""A second Clinton presidency would end gridlock in Washington."" However, he did recognize that Hillary Clinton, as president, would face an uphill battle to reach that goal. Monday, Hillary Clinton's favorite Republican, Sen. John McCain, vowed that Republicans would block anyone Hillary Clinton nominates to the Supreme Court.During an odd moment in his speech, Bill Clinton said, ""I've tried to run for her on her behalf when I've gone around on my little bus tours around rural Iowa and rural Ohio, and I'm gonna do one in western Pennsylvania. I'm about to go to north Florida and do one.""Hillary Rodham Clinton is currently preparing for the final debate Wednesday night in Las Vegas.

4	4	http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/10/18/bret-stephens-imaginary-nazis-nevertrump/	POLLAK: Bret Stephens and the Imaginary Nazis of NeverTrump	"Bret Stephens of the Wall Street Journal used his Tuesday column to accuse Donald Trump of spinning antisemitic conspiracy theories. It was Stephens's latest, and most offensive, attempt to shame Trump supporters.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe pretext for his attack was Trump's declaration, in a recent speech, that Hillary Clinton is part of a ""power structure of the political establishment"" that ""has met in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty."" That, Stephens says, is antisemitism.But it happens to be true.Clinton not only ""met"" with international banks, but claimed huge fees for each speech, and then refused to release the transcripts of her remarks. It is only thanks to Wikileaks that we know some of what she said. And in one speech, to a Brazilian bank, Clinton proclaimed: ""My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders.""So every part of what Donald Trump said is dead-on accurate. And it is not antisemitic to say so.In a similar vein, Hillary Clinton supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free trade agreement whose details are being hidden from the public even as their representatives confer new authority on the president to negotiate it. American workers who have suffered from two decades of Chinese competition (enabled by the last Clinton administration) fear they are being betrayed.True, there is a case to be made for free trade. But Clinton is not making it -- at least not in public. She is keeping her real views hidden until after the election.Or consider the Iran deal. Secret negotiations began on Hillary Clinton's watch -- with the extremist Ahmadinejad regime, not its ""moderate"" successor, as the public was told. President Barack Obama lied to his own security officials about the contents of the deal, then took it to the UN Security Council before giving the U.S. Congress any say in the matter. He bypassed the Senate altogether, defying the Constitution and destroying U.S. sovereignty.That is exactly what Donald Trump described.Stephens argued stridently against the Iran deal, but when Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) emerged as the leaders of  public opposition to the agreement, he continued to sneer at them as the representatives of an unwashed ""vulgarian"" base that he chose, for whatever reason, to despise.Stephens yearns for a robust U.S. foreign policy, but has always underestimated the support of the grass-roots for precisely such a policy, provided it is successful. He is evidently blinded by his own prejudices.Those prejudices are shared by a half-dozen or so critics who have contrived the absurd notion that Trump is an antisemite, or at least inspiring antisemites.That slanderous projection began with the fraudulent Ur-text posted by Lloyd Grove at the Daily Beast, in which a blogger falsely accused Breitbart News of siccing Twitter trolls on her.Those Twitter trolls are central to the antisemitism libel -- though no one has bothered to ascertain whether they are actual people, or even paid Democratic operatives.Stephens, who takes a pro forma swipe at Breitbart, cites three sources for his claim that Trump's speech is antisemitic.One, amazingly, is the New York Times, which the Journal's editorial page usually mocks, and which is dead-set against Trump. A second source is the Daily Stormer, a racist publication which Stephens apparently reads with a degree of unhealthy interest. And the third is a fictional novel, Philip Roth's The Plot Against America, which imagines a Charles Lindbergh presidency.One critic described that book as a work of ""nightmare envy,"" and that is perhaps the best description for the mindset shared by Stephens and company, who in imagining Trump as the Fourth Reich conveniently cast themselves in heroic roles as his brave literary opponents.Ironically, in addressing his message specifically to ""politically conservative Jews,"" Stephens gives undue weight to the left's antisemitic canard that Republican Jews are motivated by foreign policy, not by other issues.There is, in fact, one side in this election that has made an issue of Jewishness, and it is the side for which Stephens and his fellows will be voting, which sought to exploit Sen. Bernie Sanders's lapsed Judaism.Stephens et al. overlook that, instead stoking fears that reached their nadir last week with an article in Ha'aretz that predicted Trump would ignite an antisemitic orgy because some Clinton cronies he criticized in the last debate have ""distinctively Jewish names"" (their words, not his).The only explanation for the contrived hysteria must be that Stephens and his cohort of accusers share a deep misconception with the American left about the nature of their compatriots in ""flyover country.""If it is actually plausible to them that behind some random Twitter gadflies, there really are tens of millions of ""deplorables"" or ""bitter clingers"" waiting to spray-paint swastikas on the nearest synagogue, then they can only hold their fellow Americans in the deepest contempt.And there is one other thing Stephens et al. share with the left -- something alluded to by William McGurn, in the column that followed Stephens's own: namely, an embrace of the culture of political correctness, of shaming and silencing.It is not enough to object to Trump's policies, or rhetorical excesses: he and his followers must be stormtroopers. It is likewise impossible to state the truth of Clinton's record: we must preserve the sensibilities of the opportunistically ""triggered.""Beyond this pointless, and hurtful, argument -- which the NeverTrump crowd has pursued in deeply personal fashion -- there is a real political issue. It is this: The West has no hope of resisting such threats as Islamic radicalism or Chinese expansion unless it re-discovers its Christianity and patriotism.Those who mistake nationalism or evangelism for some kind of secret antisemitic code should get a grip: we are in for a rough few decades. We need each other. Spare the accusations for those who deserve them.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

""Jake"" Siewert, head of corporate communications for Goldman Sachs wrote to Politico correspondent Ben White in a February 2015 email.""Apparently, the Clintons have created such an effective aid organization that result-oriented donors like the Gates Foundation and Bloomberg Philanthropy give them money to distribute to worthy causes and help poor people,"" Siewert continued. ""More than 90 cents of every dollar raised goes to deliver aid in places like Haiti, Rwanda, and countries in desperate need.""The WikiLeaks email exchange does not include a response from White -- as Siewert forwarded his original email to John Podesta and other senior Clinton Foundation officials.""And apparently, some foreign countries without effective foreign aid organizations of their own choose to donate money to the Clinton programs rather than recreate the wheel,"" Siewert's email read. ""All in all, not a bad time for the press to be getting lathered up about a non-issue but seems like less here than meets the eye.""That ""non-issue"" Siewert refers to are the myriad accounts of the Clinton Foundation's acceptance of contributions from foreign countries with business before the U.S. government while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, as first reported in Clinton Cash. Even before Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Peter Schweizer's bestselling book was released, Clinton was struggling to answer questions around the corruption and favoritism shown to her foundation's donors while she was secretary of state. Many of those allegations have been verified and confirmed by dozens of establishment media outlets.Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson.SIGN UP"	['Hudson', 'Clinton']	[]

Tim Kaine (D-VA) gave what was promoted as a major speech on the economy in Detroit Tuesday afternoon. It turned out instead to be a sermon on social justice in which he proclaimed that a new war on poverty will be ""the defining mission"" of a Hillary Clinton-Tim Kaine administration.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERKaine's speech comes more than half a century after Democratic President Lyndon Johnson announced the original ""War on Poverty"" in 1964, a set of largely failed government policies designed to end poverty in our time.Kaine delivered his speech at a private event attended by several hundred supporters that was held at the headquarters of a local non-profit, Focus:Hope.""This is my ninth race,"" Kaine began. ""This has been by far the most surreal race I've ever seen.""""The things that get attention aren't the important things. I want to talk about something that is really important. That is what we can do to battle poverty in the United States,"" he said.Kained noted that Father Cunningham and Eleanor Josaitis ""founded Focus:Hope to address poverty and injustice in struggling neighborhoods. Here they are fifty years later and Focus:Hope is doing so much good for so many people.""This year's presidential election is ""more than just a difference between candidates,"" Kaine said.""It's an election that's a test of our values. It's America looking in the mirror and saying what do we see there,"" he added.""Hillary and I have a plan for creating jobs and opportunities across the board,"" the Democratic Senator from Virginia said.""In order to fight poverty, you first have to see it,"" he said, adding ""Jesus talked about the poor probably more than any other topic.""
""Poverty is hiding in plain sight, and wherever it is and however it looks, we've got to challenge ourselves to tackle it,"" he added.""We're in a global competition,"" Kaine noted.""Fighting poverty is really a growth strategy,  a competitive strategy, but it's also a moral issue,"" he said.It will be, he added, ""the defining mission of a Clinton-Kaine administration.""It was an unusual campaign tactic for ""the defining mission"" of a presidential campaign to be announced by the vice-presidential candidate while the presidential candidate is entirely off the campaign trail, preparing for the next debate.Kaine then outlined what he called the  pillars of the Clinton-Kaine anti-poverty program:1. Invest in underserved communities and create jobs.
2. Help create safe housing in safe communities.
3. Give at risk kids skills and opportunities they need to succeed""This jobs bill at the front is about infrastructure,"" he said of the first pillar. Eight years ago, candidate Obama promoted an $800 billion ""shovel ready"" infrastructure jobs bill whose purely partisan passage by Congress in the first month of his administration in 2009 helped spark the popular outrage that helped launch the Tea Party Movement.In the end, very few of those infrastructure projects turned out to be ""shovel ready,"" and the country's infrastructure remains in poor condition in many areas.Kaine then took a shot at Donald Trump, using the parable of the Good Samaritan from the New Testament.""In my own faith tradition there is the tale of the Good Samaritan,"" the story of a man traveling outside his home who is beaten, robbed, and left on the side of the road.""A whole lot of people walked by him, and did nothing. I bet even one of them walked on by and said 'You're a loser!'  That's a parable that speaks to today,"" Kaine added.""Here in this country there are still people on the side of the road, and they're asking for help,"" he said.""Some made a mistake and are looking for a second chance,"" he added.""The question for us in this election is, do we just walk on by or do we offer help ... to make somebody's life better,"" Kaine said.""Hillary Clinton and I don't just walk on by,"" he said, noting they would help, ""especially providing ladders of success for the poor.""As the Detroit News reported, Kaine's speech touched on themes first addressed by running mate Clinton ""in a recent New York Times op-ed, where she began by declaring ""the true measure of any society is how we take care of our children.""Kaine also said that he and Hillary focused on ""examining root causes,"" of poverty in the United States.Those causes, he said included the country's  ""legacy of racial discrimination.""Kaine said the Hillary Clinton plan would ""target our public investments in hard hit neighborhoods"" and  ""will provide funding for cities like Detroit.""Our plan, he added will ""put people to work building infrastructure for tomorrow,"" which included ""clean energy.""""Let's do something good in the first 100 days [of a Hillary Clinton administration],"" he exhorted the crowd.""In the area of jobs and wages it is important to kind of know where jobs come from. . . Small businesses in this country create two-thirds or more of new jobs,"" he noted.""We want to make it easier for small business to get started in our communities ... especially minority and women-oriented businesses,"" he explained.Instead of focusing on the reduction of governmental regulations, which most small businesses consider the biggest impediment to their growth, Kaine lauded a program recently launched in Detroit.""Your mayor has launched programs like Motor City Match, which accelerate the ability of small businesses [to get started]."" Under that program, ""people compete to get dollars to succeed,"" he said.In effect, Kaine is promoting the idea that a bankrupt local city government should get into the business of seed capital financing for small businesses.""We're putting an extra focus on youth jobs ... On the wage side, we've got to make sure anyone who works full time doesn't live in poverty. We ought to have a minimum wage that values work,"" Kaine said.""Hillary and I are proud that the party has put in its platform a $15-an-hour minimum wage,"" he added.""Here's another idea ... doubling the child care tax credit, letting benefits for low income families kick in immediately.""Kaine claimed that one policy alone ""could help many raise out of poverty.""""Protecting social security,"" he said, ""is very connected to the poverty agenda.""Kaine then talked about the second pillar of the Clinton-Kaine anti-poverty program. ""Second, if we're going to tackle poverty, we're going to have to get into neighborhoods and poverty,"" he said.""Where you live, the zipcode you live in determines the jobs you can get ... it can determine whether the very air you breathe is clean. . .It's like a big lottery,"" he added, and the lucky lottery winners just happen to be born in the right neighborhoods.""This is what we have to do with respect to housing in neighborhoods. . . Provide more incentives to provide low income rental subsidies. . . We've got to expand tax credits to expand the choices...for working families,"" he said.Kaine also said we have to ""stop predatory lending practices,"" which include the worst abuses of payday lenders,"" who are regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).He vowed to defend the CFPB, which was a key element of the Dodd-Frank Act.Recently, a federal appeals court struck down the provision of the Dodd-Frank Act that made the director of the CFPB a lifetime appointee who could not be removed by a new president.""Donald Trump says they want to eliminate Dodd-Frank. We're not going to let them,"" Kaine added.Kaine also briefly touched on health care.""We're going to make sure our low income families maintain access to the quality affordable health care they have under the affordable health care act,"" he said.The Democratic vice-presidential nominee was particularly enamored in his discussion of ""gun violence.""""You can't talk about the neighborhood issues without talking about gun violence,"" he said.""This epidemic scars every community in the United States. Gun violence is now the leading cause of death for young black Americans,"" he added.Kaine vowed he would ""fight for common sense reforms that the American public and even gun owners overwhelmingly want.""He then noted that ""the final pillar of the anti-poverty plan, this may be the most important one, is the education one.""""Our administration would want to do a number of things. . . We're going to start with early childhood education. If you can provide early childhood education, you will effect them positively throughout their entire life,"" he added.Kaine noted that his wife, Ann Holton, who was in attendance at the speech, had recently resigned as Secretary of Education in the State of Virginia and was very familiar with education issues.""We want to make universal pre-K available for every four-year-old in the country,"" he said.He also vowed the federal government would ""pay for the repair of poor public schools"" because ""kids should be entitled to go to good schools no matter what zipcodes they live in.""He then outlined a significant expansion of public schools into social services.""We can work with our school systems to reform overly punitive school penalties and help them invest in social workers,"" he said.""You've got to provide community services in school buildings that teachers aren't really the ones to provide. You've got to have social services available. There should be the social services right there in school buildings,"" he added.As for college education, Kaine said he wants to make it more affordable for everyone, but especially for low income families.
""Hillary and I want to make it so that every low income family can send their child to college tuition free at community colleges and public universities,"" he said.College, he added, should be ""debt free for everybody.""Kaine also touched on technical education, and praised organized labor.""We've got to focus on career and technical education. Nobody does this better than organized labor,"" he said.Kaine added that ""we've got to stand up for the right to collective bargaining.""1. Invest in underserved communities and create jobs.

Although Hussein's killing marks the beginning of the Sunni-Shi'ite divide in the Muslim world, it was celebrated in the entirely Sunni Gaza Strip as well.Several social media posts lauded the events as part of Iran's ongoing attempt to bring the people of Gaza into their orbit. Jihadi organizations, for their part, have accused the Hamas government of turning a blind eye to the increasingly confident - and Iran-funded - Shi'ite minority in the Strip, so as not to raise the ire of the Islamic Republic.Muhammad Mishmesh, an executive at Hamas' Al Aqsa TV, came under fire for writing a Facebook post praising the festival using Shi'ite terminology. Mishmesh quickly deleted it, but it not before it went viral.""Ashura is the day when the world went dark, and the nation started deteriorating and neglecting the prophet's heritage,"" he wrote.""With the killing of the representative of the prophet's tribe, the master of the youth of heaven, the Imam, the martyr, the revolutionary Hussein. Our Lord Hussein, blessed be the day you were born, the day you were killed, and the day you will be sent back by Allah. May a curse lie on Yazid, your corrupt killer. Hussein the martyr and revolutionary.""For Iran's detractors, the post was a smoking gun, revealing the extent of Hamas' collusion with Shi'ites. Many elements in Mishmesh's post disparaged Sunnis, from the insistence on Hussein's lineage as the only successors of prophet Muhammad to the claim that Hussein has messianic qualities, as well as the curse on Yazid, a Sunni hero.Iran's detractors say that Gaza's Shi'ites are no longer afraid to speak out, and Hamas has been instrumental in making this happen.Another post that made the rounds was written by Muhammad Harb, a social activist who recently ""came out"" as a Shi'ite.""Yazid, you lost,"" Harb wrote. ""See the memory of the prophet's dynasty spreading. ... See their divine message spreading and purifying the land from your and your criminal soldiers' transgression, see the Imam Hussein leading the charge against your allies and the enemies of Allah, the Zionists and the Americans and the Saudi family and IS and the Wahabis, and all the lowlifes, the criminals, the cynical, and the uneducated who support them.""Mithqal Alsalmy, another well-known activist, pulled no punches: ""It's a time of mourning for the spirit of the purest of men, for the spirit of the capital of honor, for the spirit of the state of heroism, for the planet of men, the hero leader, who defeated the devil, the Imam Hussein Bin Ali. It was a massacre perpetrated against the sons and daughters of the Prophet, peace be upon him. Ahura.""Remarkably, Alsalmy shared his brother's post, in which he declared that the family disavowed their rowdy relative for adopting Shi'a.""My brother Wael, along with my brothers Suheil, Khader, and Mustafa, claim I am no longer a member of their family and that they reject my faith,"" Alsalmy wrote. ""As if someone told them they could undo my love for the prophet's dynasty. I too declare that I have no part of their secular faith. I am at your service, Hussein. I will never let you go even if everybody leaves me and declares I am not their brother. I will not prefer them to the prophet's sons and grandsons, who I think are ten times better than my mother and father. The prophet's family also distanced themselves from him. I abide by your word, Hussein. You are my family, you are my love. You are my mother, my father, my grandmother, my entire life.""The Gaza Strip has witnessed the establishment of a small Iranian-funded militia, Al Sabareen, after political and ideological differences drove a wedge between Hamas and Islamic Jihad on the one hand and Iran on the other.Several attempts have been made on the lives of Al Sabareen's leaders, who have been accused by jihadis of spreading Shi'a in the exclusively Sunni territory.SIGN UP"	[]	[]

But when officials arrived to take possession of the boxes, two ended up missing and were never accounted for.To make it that much harder for anyone to see what the emails contained, Hillary's team printed out all the emails on paper instead of simply turning over the electronic data that could be efficiently key word searched. Lawyers often call this technique ""burying"" the enemy in an avalanche of documents, an act meant to make it harder for an opponent to find anything that can be used against them in court.On page 88 of a document chronicling some of the evidence chain of the Hillary emails posted to the FBI Records Vault website, records indicate that Hillary's legal team, Williams & Connolly, told State that 14 boxes of emails printed out on paper from Hillary's server were ready to be picked up. But when State Dept. officials arrived they found 12 boxes, not 14.The suspicious excerpt reads:In December 2014, Williams & Connolly informed STATE they had fourteen boxes containing approximately thirty thousand e-mails. However, when STATE officials arrived to pick up the boxes, STATE only received twelve boxes. IC/IG had no information as to whether Williams & Connolly were authorized to store classified information of if KENDALL and TURNER held security clearances.Note that at the time it was thought that neither David Kendall, Hillary Clinton's personal attorney, nor Williams & Connolly law partner Katherine Turner had the proper security clearances to even be handling these sensitive emails.Nearly a year after the Dept. of State picked up the twelve boxes of printed emails, the law firm claimed that both Kendall and Turner had been awarded security clearances in order to work with the email situation.

Donald Trump has argued that it can be rigged - perhaps that it is being rigged - although he seems short on specifics or evidence.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIn response, many - including some in the media as part of their ""fact checking"" role - are trying to assure the public that the election cannot possibly be rigged; that any claims that such a thing might even be possible are ""false"" or ""not true.""Quite apart from the fact that it is usually impossible to prove a negative, these reassurances seem to be false.  Election computers have already been hacked, other hacking has resulted in the release of documents quite capable of affecting the election, both federal and state officials are taking steps aimed a preventing such interference, and a few professors and others have shown how easily such an event could occur.Although I was hacking as far back as the 1950s, and created a computer technique for determining the chance that any small group of voters could change the outcome of a presidential election - now called ""The Banzhaf Index"" - which has been widely adopted and utilized, I certainly don't ask you to take my word for it.  On the contrary, the evidence very briefly outlined below shows that it is possible (although clearly not probable) for an election to be hacked.Listen to Prof. Banzhaf discuss this on Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM:Considering the enormous consequences if it were to actually (or even apparently) occur, we must accept the fact that it is true, in the same sense that it is true (although again not probable) that our electric distribution system, airplane flight control system, banking systems, etc. could be hacked.Moreover, while it may be difficult for hackers to actually change the outcome of the election, it is at least possible - in the same sense that many responsible people now agree that computer experts might be able to hack into the nation's banking system, electricity distribution control system, air transit systems, etc.; as they have with so many major governmental organizations and powerful corporations.Perhaps more importantly, a hack could easily cast significant doubt on the validity of the election even if the election result wasn't in fact changed, especially if the losing nominee and/or his supporters voice suspicion concerning the outcome, and thus help to undermine the faith of many citizens in the entire election process.  Indeed, some 40% of the public, according to a recent survey, are deeply skeptical about the integrity of the nation's election apparatus.Note that if some election results appears suspicious, or only a few voting machines display clearly exaggerated results, or if the word ""hacked"" or a picture of Guy Fawkes appears on the screens of a few computers used to compile votes, disappointed voters could become very upset.Here's just some of the evidence that rigging/hacking the forthcoming election is possible.* According to NBC news and other media sources, the CIA is currently preparing to launch an unprecedented cyber war against Russia as retaliation for what has now been clearly identified as attempted Russian interference in the forthcoming U.S. presidential election.  This definitely includes the recent hacking of the election systems in Arizona and Illinois, and probably the release of emails damaging to Democrats for which Russia is also believed to be responsible.* Also, Homeland Security Secretary Jeb Johnson is considering designating election systems around the country as a ""critical infrastructure"" in need of federal assistance and protection, and has already established an Election Infrastructure Cybersecurity Working Group, as well as launching a Voting Infrastructure Cybersecurity Action Campaign.* Meanwhile, an anonymous Homeland Security Department official reportedly said that the voter systems of more than 20 states - including the key state of Florida - have been targeted by hackers just in recent months.* The FBI's reported that the data bases of election boards in at least two states were successfully hacked, apparently by foreign governments, and in at least one case the hackers were able to insert malicious software into the system.  Moreover, their report showed that both infiltrations were done using common off-the-shelf software programs readily available to anyone who wants them from the Internet. In other words, hacking election machines can be done not only by hostile governments and master computer experts, but also by common garden-variety hackers.* Just weeks after the release of a report showing how easy it would be for Russians or even high school nerds to hack a presidential election, two other professors have just proven it.  University of Michigan Professor Alex Halderman was able to infiltrate a voting system from 500 miles away, and, in another demonstration, manipulate voting results with only a screwdriver and some memory chips.  Princeton professor Andrew Appel was able to hack an election machine in only 7 minutes.* According to an official from the Department of Homeland Security, 25 states have reached out for federal aid related to election security, and DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson said he hopes more will seek assistance.* CNN reluctantly reports that ""we've officially entered the era of the hackable [presidential] election.""* Mother Jones reports that ""the concern that somebody might try to hack voting machines no longer seems outlandish.""* Politico says a computer expert remarked that if some of the more susceptible voting machines hadn't yet been hacked, ""it was only because no one tried.""* Money magazine says we've officially entered the era of the hackable election.* Wired claims that the move toward electric voting machines turned out to be a ""technological train wreck.""*ABC News featured a piece entitled ""Yes, It's Possible to Hack the Election.""* Tarrant County, Texas, is now investigating voter fraud through the use of mail-in ballots.Despite the lack of real support or substantiation for the claims Trump is making about a rigged election, all of the above is more than ample reason to believe that many recent developments now make elections subject to being hacked, if not rigged.These include the increased use of electronic voting machines (especially where they leave no paper trail), that more and more computers and data processing devices used in the election process are connected to the Internet, and that some states permit residents to cast their votes over the Internet.Also, under our Electoral College system, any rigging or hacking which resulted in a change in even a very small number of votes, and perhaps even only a small number of votes in one individual state, could change the outcome of the presidential election, something very unlikely to occur were there to be a direct nationwide presidential election.In this regard remember how the 2000 presidential election was decided by fewer than 1000 votes out of almost 6 million cast in Florida; so a hack of as little as 550 votes could have resulted in a different president.In short, even a very small probability that an election could be hacked, just like the small possibility that hackers could disable our power supply, airline system, etc. must be taken seriously and reported to the public, considering the gravity of the harm which would be caused.Indeed, the risk of a hacked or rigged election might be even greater. Power and airline systems which have been hacked should be able to be fixed and back to normal shortly, but damage to the faith of citizen in their voting systems would have long lasting effects.In summary, while I do not support, in the absence of any hard evidence, that the forthcoming election has already been rigged for or against any party or any candidate, or that any such rigging is likely or even probable in the near future, we should be wary of even the very small probability of an election hack.To paraphrase a well-known James Bond movie: ""Never Say Never.""John F.

Fallon wrote:Circling back around on guns as a follow up to the Friday morning discussion: the Today show has indicated they definitely plan to ask bout guns, and so to have the discussion be more of a news event than her previous times discussing guns, we are going to background reporters tonight on a few of the specific proposals she would support as President - universal background checks of course, but also closing the gun show loophole by executive order.Making Gun Manufacturers Libel for Crimes Committed With Guns-In the October 7 WikiLeaks' release, Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon also said Clinton will ""[impose] manufacturer liability"" if elected. We got a clear picture of what this means on October 14, after the Sandy Hook lawsuit against Remington Arms was dismissed. Clinton took to Twitter to say it was ""incomprehensible"" that Remington was not held liable. Think about it: the AR-15 used in the Sandy Hook Elementary attack was legally made and legally sold-it was registered to Nancy Lanza, AdamLanza's mother. But Adam stole the gun and thereafter carried out horrendous treachery. How can the gunmaker be liable in that situation?Clinton's Support of a 25% Tax on Gun Sales-Wikileaks also released an email wherein PR firm Grunwald Communications asked for clarification on Clinton's support of a 25% tax on gun sales. The email was dated October 4, 2015. In it, Mandy Grunwald wrote, ""I also saw something about her supporting a 25% tax on gun sales back in 1993."" ABC News reports that Clinton was ""unequivocal"" in her support for such a tax during her husband's presidency and, on June 5, 2016, she told George Stephanopoulos her support for the tax was part of the nationalized healthcare push. She said, ""What I was saying back then was that we have a lot of public health costs that taxpayers end up paying for through Medicaid, Medicare, through uncompensated care, because that was in the context of the push for health care reform and that we needed some way to try to defray those costs."" However, Breitbart News reported that her support was also rooted in the present. For example, she talked about meeting with survivors of the December 2, 2015, San Bernardino attack, then said:When you have mass shootings, you not only have the terrible deaths, you have people who are injured. What they talked to me about was, where do they get the financial support to deal with both the physical and the emotional trauma. You know, is it a workman's comp support, which is one of the arguments? Is it private insurance, Is it because they work for the county, something the county should pay for?Clinton Campaign Discards Shootings That Do Not Further Gun Control Agenda-WikiLeaks' ongoing email release also showed that the Clinton campaign discarded shootings that did not further the gun control agenda. For example, although black teen Jordan Davis was killed with a gun, the campaign did not include him in a Clinton gun violence essay because they believed the waters would be muddied by the fact that this killer was white. In an email exchange dated January 14, 2016, Clinton campaign manager director of engagement, De'Ara Balenger, critiqued Clinton's gun violence essay, saying:This is great. My edits are attached. The only flag here is that Jordan Davis was killed by a white man, so arguably - this crime was racially motivated, which takes this outside the discussion of gun violence. Was there another mother in the Chicago meeting where the shooting was NOT racially motivated? If yes, we should use that story instead of Jordan Davis.Clinton Criticizes NRA for not being 'Reasonable' On Pro-Gun Stance-WikiLeaks released the transcript of a June 4, 2013, speech Hillary Clinton gave to Goldman Sachs. In it, Clinton claims the NRA is not ""reasonable"" on their pro-gun stance. She first talked about partisanship: ""You know, people get rewarded for being partisan, and that's on both sides. The biggest threat that Democrats and Republicans face today, largely because of gerrymandering in the House, is getting a primary opponent from either the far right or the far left."" She then shifted and told the story of a state senator from Kentucky who allegedly fell out of favor with the NRA for tabling a piece of pro-gun legislation. Clinton described the unnamed senator as being ""highly regarded"" and having ""an A plus rating"" from the NRA. Yet Clinton stressed that the NRA supported the senator's challenger in the next election, unseating the senator for hesitating to pass the pro-gun bill when the opportunity was afforded her.Clinton suggested the NRA's approach betrayed an unwillingness to be ""reasonable."" She said:So the NRA recruited an opponent for her who beat her. They put a lot of money into it and basically: You couldn't be reasonable. You couldn't say let's try to reason this out together. You had to tow the line, and whether it's a financial line or gun control line or whatever the line might be.This is the same Clinton who is so determined to secure more gun control that she made clear she will do it with or without Congress's cooperation.Clinton Campaign Feared 'Blowback' for Gun Control Push-An email thread dated March 17, 2016, shows various members of the Clinton campaign corresponding about how to approach talking about gun control. At the heart of the correspondence was ""a press call with AZ locals about guns"" and how to go after Donald Trump on the issue. John Podesta emailed that he was worried about broaching the issue: ""Interestingly, I am worried about blowback from our supporters.""Similar concerns about how to talk about gun control, or if doing so was even wise, came up in a November 5, 2015 email thread. There, Clinton senior advisor Jim Margolis suggested rewording the draft of a Clinton speech so as to give rural voters the impression that Clinton supported their desires to handle gun control differently than it is handled in urban settings. However, a careful reading of Margolis's changes show Clinton supporting local gun control laws only when localities are trying to make the laws more strict.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of ""Bullets with AWR Hawkins,"" a Breitbart News podcast.

Mitt Romney carried the State in 2012 with 4,569,843 votes to President Barack Obama's 3,308,124. John McCain won by close to the same numbers in 2008. The State Legislature is dominated with Republican seats.Clinton plopped down $1oo,000 by Tuesday, and she will be spending that money in Austin, Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio, reported The Texas Tribune.The Democrat nominee is targeting large urban cities in Texas that are either politically blue, or are trending purple, like Houston.Although there has been much-to-do by those on the other side of the red aisle about Democratic chances in the State, as well as the meaning of the ad purchase, part of the political optimism of the Democratic hopeful, is the fact that The Dallas Morning News endorsed Clinton. The paper has not endorsed a Democrat for president in 75 years.Her supporters are tweeting the ad in which Clinton quotes from and touts the Morning News endorsement:The Chief launches a one week ad buy in TEXAS higlighting the conservative Dallas Morning News support. pic.twitter.com/ovGBeJ2Mu9-- RogelioGarcia Lawyer (@LawyerRogelio) October 18, 2016The Dallas paper published an editorial on September 7th endorsing the Democrat presidential nominee. Those wishful-thinkers should look at the consequences to the publication which became evident in the weeks thereafter.Breitbart Texas reported on September 21st that The Dallas Morning News had taken a hit in subscriptions after its early September endorsement of Clinton.""Certainly we've paid a price for our presidential recommendation, but then, we write our editorials based on principle, and sometimes principle comes at a cost,"" The Dallas Morning News Editor Mike Wilson told Poynter. The DMN editor added, ""I've had a lot of conversations with readers lately, and I respect their views and their right to disagree with us. The most important thing to us is that they vote, even if it's not for our favorite candidate, because democracy doesn't work if people don't vote.""After the endorsement, angry protestors convened outside the DMN building in Dallas. Wilson approached them and he was asked ""How could we support known criminal/liar/killer @Hillary Clinton?"" One of the protestors called the Dallas editor an ""enemy of the state."" Another protestor accused the newspaper of taking ""big money"" for the endorsement.Polling in Texas shows that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is ahead in the State. Real Clear Politics puts Trump ahead with an average of the polls at 44.0 percent to Clinton's 38.3 percent.Clinton has a lot of money to spend and she just put another $2 million down in Arizona, another historically red state, reported the Tribune.In late August, the Democratic candidate raised $18 million in just a three-day swing through California. She raked in nearly $70 million in June, as reported by Breitbart News. Republican nominee Trump also had a good month, raising $51 million in June. He raised $37 million in July, and as reported, 64 percent of this came from small-dollar donors. Clinton raised $63 million, with only 36 percent of the donations coming from donations under $200. Trump's campaign and the Republican National Committee (RNC) raised $64 million in July and had nearly $80 million on hand, reported Breitbart News.As reported by Breitbart News on September 1st, the Clinton campaign has spent $77 million on television ads. The Trump campaign had spent only $5 million by that time.While Clinton has raised money from celebrities, billionaires, and political action committees, and Trump has also received large donations from the very wealthy, the Trump campaign set a fundraising record for raising $5 million in small donations in just one day, reported Breitbart News. The donations under $200 were made online and this amount did not include donations made by mail or over the phone. Billionaire globalist George Soros has given at least $11.9 million to Clinton.President Barack Obama will be in Beverly Hills for a $100,000 per person fundraiser for Clinton on October 24th, as reported by Breitbart News.Lana Shadwick is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

The average salary for a member of Congress is $174,000.More than 50 members who are retiring or are being voted out are expected to be looking for work come January 2017.Nels Olson, co-lead of Korn/Ferry International's director and chief executive officer search business in Washington, said he's talked with many members either retiring or voted out of office about their next move.""Sitting on a board is always top of their list,"" he said.SIGN UP"	['Hill']	[]

One report found that as many as 181 companies were both donors to the Foundation and seekers of special deals from the Dept. of State.This is on top of the billions the Clinton Foundation received from such nations as Russia, Qatar, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and many others.Karen Hobert Flynn, president of Common Cause, a nonpartisan government watchdog, told the paper that the whole scheme looked ""unseemly.""When you couple all of these activities together, it gives an unseemly appearance that this was another way for Clinton foundation donors to try to get what they wanted. I don't see any quid pro quos. But I do think these are sophisticated lobbying operations by Clinton foundation donors trying to leverage Department of State support for whatever their pet projects are.Many of these entangled relations were revealed and dissected in the blockbuster book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich, released in May of 2015.

But I do think these are sophisticated lobbying operations by Clinton foundation donors trying to leverage Department of State support for whatever their pet projects are.SIGN UP"	['Clinton', 'Warner']	[]

Where is the defense of Wikileaks from all the pundits who've speculated that Trump would try to silence critical journalism? -- Dr. Jill Stein (@DrJillStein) October 17, 2016Stein has previously explained that members of corporate media are ""prop[ping] up"" Hillary Clinton and are smearing Clinton's opponents because ""they're huge donors to her foundation.""""Why does the corporate media prop up Hillary and smear her opponents? Because they're huge donors to her foundation,"" Stein wrote on Twitter. ""90% of the US media is controlled by 6 corporations. The 2-party system has made them rich; no surprise they prop it up #FollowTheMoney.""Stein has repeatedly attacked ""corporate media"" for not covering the Green Party's ""people-powered"" campaign- a campaign, which, Stein says, presents voters with a clear alternative to Washington's corporatist ""uni-party.""#PodestaEmails10 show HRC kept 55K emails from Congress.

This included a 14.8 percent increase for Blue Care Network, 18.7 percent for Blue Cross Blue Shield, 16.8 percent for Health Alliance Plan, a 13.9 percent increase for Priority Health, and an increase of 39.2 percent for Humana.Aetna and Alliance Health were the exceptions, since they did not get their approved rate increases in full.Still, insurers such as Blue Cross Blue Shield insist that they are losing money on the exchanges and are not trying to profit off the exchange's plans.A few insurance companies have even pulled out of the exchange, such as HMO plans by Harbor Health and UnitedHealthcare and PPO plans by Priority Health and Alliance Health, according to the state's insurance department.SIGN UP	[]	['healthcare']
