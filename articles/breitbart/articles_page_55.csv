That's not a realistic way to support any type of program. So over the years Medicare, Medicaid changes were made both at the state and federal level to protect the programs and ensure their growth.Tavenner explained that all federal programs have to be tweaked, and that fixing Obamacare is no different.""We're at that same point with the exchanges,"" Tavenner continued, ""and if you think about the amount of energy and effort that's gone on with everybody in this room over the last six years, the idea that we'd take on yet another public program when our answer lies in stabilizing the product that we have.""""And we have smart people in Congress. We have smart people in the administration,"" she added. ""There are ways to sit down and work this out.""Tavenner, however, acknowledged that Obamacare's troubles will likely continue.""If the program hasn't stabilized in three years, it's going to need some additional relief,"" she said.

According to the Tampa Bay Times, Latimer testified by phone, saying, ""If a voter whose identity can't be confirmed is allowed to cast a regular ballot, it wouldn't be legal and it couldn't be corrected. You're not going to get that ballot back and that could lead to some real issues.""Walker also highlighted Maria Matthews' testimony, the director of the state's Division of Elections. Matthews testified that ""State workers are being ordered to work 'mandatory overtime' of up to 16 hours on weekends to process forms as fast as possible."" Matthews went on to emphasize,""We are devoting all the resources that we have.""On Tuesday, the Florida Democratic Party had filed a motion to allow anyone to show up at a polling place with an ID and vote, even if they are not on the state's official voter rolls. This motion came on the heels of an unprecedented number of new voter sign-ups in the state, after the voter registration deadline was extended due to the impact that Hurricane Matthew had on Floridians' ability to register during the final days of the original voter registration period.Judge Walker decided that there was ""absolutely no basis"" to the Democratic Party's claim that Detzner and election officials were ""dragging their feet"" when it came to processing new voter registrations.Gary Fineout, an Associated Press reporter, was live tweeting from the courtroom as Walker's ruling came down:In fed court this am on @FlaDems effort to change voting rules.

Why is he supporting Donald Trump?"" Obama asked during a campaign stop in Miami.Rubio has condemned several controversial statements by Trump, but continues to support the Republican nominee for president.Obama went after Rubio repeatedly, calling him out by name and urging his supporters to vote for Rep. Patrick Murphy (D-FL) -- Rubio's Democratic opponent for Senate.Obama pointed out that the same people who supported Donald Trump were stirred up for years by Republicans who appeared happy to say ""all kinds of toxic, crazy stuff"" about him and his administration.""There were a lot of politicians, like Marco Rubio, who know better,"" he said.

From early on, Clinton played what came to be known as the ""gender card,"" campaigning on the notion that she would shatter that final glass ""ceiling"" for women by becoming the first female president of the United States.We need a president who takes sexual violence seriously.

""At least $1 million more was donated by Friends of Saudi Arabia, co-founded by a Saudi prince.""Where children are concerned, Clinton has also disappointed the progressives she claims to represent.On the campaign trail, the Democrat nominee continually brings up her work heading the board of the Children's Defense Fund (CDF). In reality, however, Clinton has failed to protect children from sex trafficking and from exploitation as child soldiers.In May of 2014, Josh Rogin, writing at the Daily Beast, asserted:The State Department under Hillary Clinton fought hard against placing the al Qaeda-linked militant group Boko Haram on its official list of foreign terrorist organizations for two years. And now, lawmakers and former U.S. officials are saying that the decision may have hurt the American government's ability to confront the Nigerian group that shocked the world by abducting hundreds of innocent girls.Rogin wrote that Clinton, ""who made protecting women and girls a key pillar of her tenure at the State Department,"" publicly advocated for the 200 Nigerian girls kidnapped by Boko Haram.""What Clinton didn't mention was that her own State Department refused to place Boko Haram on the list of foreign terrorist organizations in 2011, after the group bombed the UN headquarters in Abuja,"" he continued. ""The refusal came despite the urging of the Justice Department, the FBI, the CIA, and over a dozen Senators and Congressmen.""In November of 2010, while Clinton was secretary of state, Human Rights Watch published a letter from various organizations to President Obama, expressing their ""deep disappointment"" with the decision to ""grant blanket national interest waivers and allow all forms of US military assistance"" to countries that continued to use child soldiers and were clearly in violation of the Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2008. Among the countries was Sudan, the primary military ally of Qatar, which made contributions to the Clinton Foundation.The letter reads:As you know, the Child Soldiers Prevention Act was adopted in 2008 with strong bipartisan support from Congress because of deep concerns over the continuing recruitment and use of child soldiers around the world. By prohibiting foreign military financing, military training and several other categories of US military assistance to governments using child soldiers, the law allows the US administration to exert powerful leverage on states with abusive child recruitment policies and practices. The United States was one of the first countries in the world to enact such groundbreaking legislation.As the Washington Post reported in February of 2015, Qatar ""spent more than $5.3 million on registered lobbyists while Clinton was secretary of state, according to the Sunlight Foundation.""The report continued:The country's lobbyists were reported monitoring anti-terrorism activities and efforts to combat violence in Sudan's Darfur region. Qatar has also come under criticism from some U.S. allies in the region that have accused it of supporting Hamas and other militant groups.

-- Planned Parenthood (@PPact) October 15, 2016[T]he Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation has accepted tens of millions of dollars in donations from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Algeria and Brunei -- all of which the State Department has faulted over their records on sex discrimination and other human-rights issues.
The department's 2011 human rights report on Saudi Arabia, the last such yearly review prepared during Mrs. Clinton's tenure, tersely faulted the kingdom for ""a lack of equal rights for women and children,"" and said violence against women, human trafficking and gender discrimination, among other abuses, were all ""common"" there.The State Department under Hillary Clinton fought hard against placing the al Qaeda-linked militant group Boko Haram on its official list of foreign terrorist organizations for two years. And now, lawmakers and former U.S. officials are saying that the decision may have hurt the American government's ability to confront the Nigerian group that shocked the world by abducting hundreds of innocent girls.As you know, the Child Soldiers Prevention Act was adopted in 2008 with strong bipartisan support from Congress because of deep concerns over the continuing recruitment and use of child soldiers around the world. By prohibiting foreign military financing, military training and several other categories of US military assistance to governments using child soldiers, the law allows the US administration to exert powerful leverage on states with abusive child recruitment policies and practices. The United States was one of the first countries in the world to enact such groundbreaking legislation.The country's lobbyists were reported monitoring anti-terrorism activities and efforts to combat violence in Sudan's Darfur region. Qatar has also come under criticism from some U.S. allies in the region that have accused it of supporting Hamas and other militant groups.

PILF filed its complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), arguing that agents from the Democracy Partners and the Foval Group--the persons caught on O'Keefe's explosive videos--""have engaged in public communications, campaign activity, targeted voter registration drives, and other targeted [get out the vote] activity ... at the request, direction, and approval of"" Hillary for America (the official name of the Clinton campaign) and the DNC.Federal law at 52 U.S.C. SS 30109(a)(2) provides that once the FEC receives a complaint, ""If the Commission ... has reason to believe that a person has committed, or is about to commit, a violation of [the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971--as amended by later statutes,]"" the FEC ""shall make an investigation of such alleged violation.""The word ""shall"" is important because it is mandatory, rather than leaving the FEC the option of taking action. Consequently, when the FEC receives a complaint that is plausible on its face and has any sort of supporting evidence or corroboration--such as, for example, a video of a political operative who says he is taking orders directly from specific persons from the Clinton campaign and the national Democratic Party--federal law requires the FEC to open an investigation.These videos fit a larger pattern of evidence of voter fraud and illegal election activity. In Virginia, a survey of only eight counties revealed hundreds of foreigners--potentially including illegal aliens--already registered to vote, which is a major focus on PILF's litigation nationwide.""American voter rolls are corrupted with unacceptable numbers of aliens who are illegally registered to vote,"" PILF President J. Christian Adams said in a statement. ""Groups should not be coordinating with campaigns and political parties to exploit vulnerabilities in our election system.""""We hope this matter is fully investigated by the FEC and that if aliens are voting, they are prosecuted by the Justice Department,"" he added. ""That would mark a change in DOJ policies of the past seven years.""Unfortunately for Trump supporters, the FEC is not required to finish an investigation and take legal enforcement action by November 8. But this legal complaint--like a second complaint later filed by O'Keefe himself--fuels media attention on the disturbingly brazen statements caught on the videos. These statements in turn advance Donald Trump's narrative about the lawlessness and corruption of Hillary Clinton and her activities, going beyond her campaign organization to include the Clinton Foundation and pay-for-play politics.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

He would be providing important cover for climate deniers backed by Silver's very respected brand. But because of our work, he is not.Legum is referring to an incident which caused a big stir in both new media and climate science circles, not long after the launch of Nate Silver's 538.We covered this story at the time under the headline Now Nate Silver Capitulates, Throws Staffer To Green Activists - because that's basically what happened. Amid much fanfare, Silver had set up his journalism site FiveThirtyEight - which made a big deal of being ""data-driven"" and therefore above the political bias of other web-based news media. One of his star writer recruits was climate expert Roger Pielke Jr. A former Director of the Center for Science and Technology Policy Research at the University of Colorado Boulder, Pielke is not an out-and-out climate sceptic but a self-described ""luke-warmer."" That is, he believes in the science of man-made global warming. But he doesn't believe in exaggerating the case.Pielke's mistake was to write a piece for FiveThirtyEight stating what he thought was a fairly unarguable, scientifically grounded truth: that there has been no increase in ""extreme weather events"" as a result of supposed man-made climate change.Almost instantly, Pielke found himself viciously attacked from a number of quarters, everywhere from The Guardian and The Week to the Columbia Journalism review, not to mention FiveThreeEight's comments section, where he was accused of writing ""propaganda for big oil.""Pielke Jr was so mortified that he never wrote on the subject of climate change for the site again and was subsequently dropped as a writer by Silver.Thanks to Wikileaks, we now know that the dark agent behind this monstering, was Climate Progress - the eco-fascist sub-section of ThinkProgress, run by Joe Romm, devoted to promulgating green propaganda and smearing sceptics.Unsurprisingly, it now emerges that one of Climate Progress's donors is Tom ""rhymes with liar"" Steyer, whose epic disgustingness I have previously chronicled here and here.No doubt Steyer - and Soros - more than get their money's worth: smearing and misinformation, after all, are what political attack dog sites are paid to do.The key question is, though, how does this square with the environmental movement's claim to hold the moral high ground?If the ""science"" is as settled as it frequently claims, why is it necessary to orchestrate attacks on any scientist who speaks even slightly out of turn?I think it's fair say that, without Climate Progress, Pielke would still be writing on climate change for 538.

A nineteenth case of active TB among refugees was reported in March 2016 by the Oakland County Health Department.In response to a FOIA request from Breitbart News, MDHHS said that no refugees had been diagnosed with MDR TB in the state during the five years between FY 2011 and FY 2015.Breitbart News has asked Ingham County Health Department whether the case of the refugee with  MDR TB was diagnosed in FY 2016, which would be consistent with the MDHHS report, or during the five years between FY 2011 and FY 2015, which would be inconsistent with the MDHHS report, but has not yet received a response to that question.Breitbart News has documented that at least 468 refugees in fifteen states have been diagnosed with active TB during the past six years.Active TB costs $17,000 to treat with a four-drug regimen over a nine month period and has a virtually 100 percent cure rate. In contrast MDR TB costs $150,000 to treat over a two year to two and a half year time period and has only a 60 percent cure rate.In 2015, there were 9,563 cases of active TB in the United States, 66 percent of which were foreign-born. In 2014, there were 91 cases of MDR TB in the United States, 88 percent of which were foreign-born.Several other states have reported cases of MDR TB among refugees, including Wisconsin (6) and Tennessee (2).The Centers for Disease Control has yet to report the MDR TB rates in the United States for 2015.Seven percent of the 3,554 refugees who arrived in Michigan during the six year period beginning in FY 2011 (October 1, 2010) and ending in FY 2016 (September 30, 2016), or 263, did not consent to initial domestic medical screenings within 90 days of their arrival, while 93 percent, or 3,291, completed their initial domestic medical screenings.All domestic medical screenings of arriving refugees in Ingham County are conducted by the Ingham County Health Department, which has been contracted by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to perform this task.Twenty-two percent of the 3,291 refugees who were resettled in Ingham County, Michigan and completed domestic medical screenings during the six years beginning October 1, 2010 and ending on September 30, 2016 tested positive for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), the Ingham County Health Department tells Breitbart News.As a point of comparison, LTBI rates among refugees arriving in other states vary from 12 percent in California to 35 percent in Vermont.Seven percent of the 3,554 refugees who arrived during this period, or 263, did not consent to initial domestic medical screenings within 90 days of their arrival.Of the 3,291 refugees who completed medical screenings in Ingham  County during this five year period, ""100% are initiated on treatment,"" the Ingham County Health Department says.""87 - 90 % successfully complete the treatment,"" the department adds.This means that at least 329 refugees who tested positive for LTBI in Ingham County have not completed treatment, and are at risk of activating their latent condition into active TB. All told, 592 of the 3,554 refugees who arrived in Ingham County during these six years either were never tested for LTBI or tested positive for it and never received treatment.As Breitbart News reported previously, a 2013 study at the University of California at San Diego concluded that refugees with LTBI have a much higher likelihood of activating than the general population. Consequently, high rates of LTBI among refugees pose a risk of active TB to the general population of communities in which they are resettled.Four percent of the general population tests positive for LTBI, and only five to ten percent of those develop active TB over their life time, according to the CDC.Ingham County is now the only county in the entire state of Michigan that has made public the LTBI rates of arriving refugees.The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) has told Breitbart News that it does not track this data and has no legal obligation to do so, despite the clear requirements for such record keeping and monitoring outlined in the Refugee Act of 1980.When asked what, if any, of this data it makes available on a regular basis MDHHS, a spokesperson for Ingham County told Breitbart News, ""All active tuberculosis cases are reported to MDHHS in MDSS (Michigan Disease Surveillance System).""The spokesperson gave no indication that the county shares refugee latent TB data with MDHHS, but noted that ""Health department staff meet with MDHHS quarterly to discuss TB cases.""Kent County (whose county seat is Grand Rapids, another center for refugee resettlement) is the only other county in the state where the local health department conducts the domestic medical screenings of arriving refugees.The Kent County Health Department has refused to provide Breitbart News with the refugee health data that Ingham County Health Department has provided. Instead, after more than a month of email exchanges, the Kent County Health Department has told Breitbart News to file a Freedom of Information Act request to obtain the required data.The Kent County Health Department has also refused to offer an explanation for the huge uptick of 22 foreign-born cases of TB reported in 2011 in the public health region of Michigan in which Kent County is the county with the largest population.In Washtenaw County (Ann Arbor), the Washtenaw County Health Department's contract to perform initial domestic medical screenings of refugees was terminated by MDHHS in September 2015. Screenings for arriving refugees in the county are now conducted by St. Joseph's Hospital.Washtenaw County Health Department tells Breitbart News that is collecting refugee health data for the period of time it conducted that service, but has not yet made it available.In three large counties in the Detroit area-Oakland, Macomb, and Wayne County--MDHHS has hired the Arab American and Chaldean Council to conduct initial domestic medical screenings of arriving refugees, but that organization has apparently not provided latent TB refugee data to the health departments in those counties, as it is required to do by the Refugee Act of 1980.Neither the Wayne County Health Department nor the Arab American and Chaldean Council have responded to Breitbart News requests for comment.Representatives for Macomb County and Oakland County tell Breitbart News they have not received latent TB refugee latent TB data--either at the individual level or the aggregate level--from the Arab American and Chaldean Council.""The Oakland County Department of Health and Human Services is unable to share refugee health data because it is on record as having never received any refugee health information from the MDHSS-contracted health screening vendor, the Arab American and Chaldean Council (ACC) or from MDHHS itself,"" a spokesperson for Secure Michigan, a local grassroots organization, tells Breitbart News.""Oakland County residents are at risk without access to this public health data, particularly given the fact that Oakland County has received over 11,000 refugees since FY 2008 and, according to their annual plans, federal vendors place refugees in jobs where infections are easily spread such as commercial food preparation,"" the spokesperson adds.L.

He thanked himself and tried to say that Americans are getting better quality care even though they don't know Obamacare is doing it. He then brought in the public option, asserting that government should provide plans as competition. He also blamed states not advertising the ACA .During a recent visit to Wilmington, North Carolina, where Pence donated supplies for flood victims of Hurricane Matthew, he remarked to hundreds gathered for a campaign rally that health insurance rates there were shooting up by over 24 percent in that state.""We're gonna meet the health insurance needs of the American people the American way through more consumer choice and free market economics,"" Pence told the fired-up crowd.Pence told the hundreds gathered that when he and Trump see enormous crowds come out in support, Trump tells him, ""Mike remember, he'll say, this is not about me, this is not about us, it's not about our party, he says, this is a movement of the American people.""He continued, ""despite the fact that it's 2-on-1 with the national media doing half of Hillary Clinton's work for her.

""Willful ignorance is no excuse. The people in our district are upset. The people are horrified. Our phones are ringing off the hook,""Lasonde claims that the stunning revelations in the video -- which has forced Creamer to resign from his work with the Hillary Clinton campaign -- has resulted in constituents to switch their support to her instead of Schakowsky.NEWS CONFERENCE 1 P.M. TODAY AT 820 DAVIS ST., EVANSTON; LASONDE TO DEMAND SCHAKOWSKY RESIGN-- Joan Lasonde (@JoanforCongress) October 19, 2016""Creamer is obviously guilty,"" Lasonde said of the veteran Chicago activist and convicted felon who is thought to have planned the Democrats' political strategy during the push for Obamacare in 2009 and 2010.""He stepped down. Inciting violence is criminal. Our question is, what was Schakowsky's part in it? Was she an accomplice? She's denying that there is even a problem.""Yesterday, she said it was manufactured and it's a non-existing scandal. She said that my call for her to step down is ridiculous,"" Lasonde continued. ""If she did not participate, at the very minimum, she needs to come out and denounce it. Instead, she's pretending that it's manufactured, that it's not a scandal.""Creamer is the co-founder of Democracy Partners, a consulting group that, according to O'Keefe's videos, apparently contracts directly with the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Creamer also affirmed on video that Clinton is aware of ""all"" of his work, and that Democracy Partners has a daily telephone call with the Clinton campaign to coordinate efforts.""And then, of course, it's now coming out, that Schakowksy's husband visited the White House 342 times since 2009. Are you kidding me? He's a convicted felon,"" Lasonde said.Creamer served several months in federal prison in 2006-7, plus several more of house arrest, for a check-kiting scheme.Lasonde noted that Schakowsky was the ringleader of protests and riots that led to the cancellation of Trump's March 11 rally at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Lasonde was present at that protest and said that ""it was ugly."" She recalled how Schakowsky herself carried a ""Gang of Hate"" sign during the rally, which featured Republicans Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner's names on it ,and which also bore the name of a Democratic super PAC with which her husband is aligned.Initial reports in the mainstream media placed the blame on Trump supporters for the March shutdown, suggesting they provoked the riots which led to the rally's cancellation. ""But now we are learning it was their people,"" Lasonde said of Schakowsky's husband and the Democratic Party. ""Lives were put at risk. It's voter intimidation. And inciting violence is criminal.""""Lasonde said she's for term limits and would even term limit herself if she were to win on November 8. ""This is how all the corruption starts. Schakowsky has been our congresswoman for 18 years. She's a nine-term incumbent and she has been part of the political ruling class for over a quarter of a century. I am not a career politician.""Lasonde also pointed out that if there was something Schakowsky wanted to accomplish, ""she should have accomplished it by now. She's had over 25 years in government. And these are soft Democrats who tell me, 'you have a point.' We've given her 25 years and we are $19 trillion in debt.""She added, ""our government is broken. Congress is at an all-time low with a 10 percent approval rate. I'm from the private sector ... If your boss gives you a 10 percent approval rating, you're fired.""Asked by Breitbart News if Lasonde has gained votes as a a result of this revelation, she said, ""Oh yes, absolutely. I know a lot of Democrats that will be crossing over. I meet with them in Schakowksy's hometown of Evanston and they agree: Anything she wanted to accomplish, she should have achieved by now.""She added that she is the only congressional challenger and candidate to receive the endorsement of the Chicago Tribune over the incumbent. And she also noted her support from the Jewish community.""The Jewish vote is also very important in our district. Schakowsky has betrayed the Jewish community. First, when she led the boycott of Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he came to speak before Congress. And she also supports the Iran nuclear deal, which is 'game ove' for the Jewish community.""""We have momentum. Momentum is on our side,"" she said. ""This is the closest we've come since Mr. Pollak ran in 2010.""Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Joel. B. Pollak, who ran against Schakowsky six years ago, is credited with paving a path for Lasonde to win the congressional seat for Republicans for the first time in decades. ""We've got a good shot and it's in large part because of Joel,"" Lasonde said. ""He set the tone.""Lasonde added, ""It's time for new representation and a fresh voice.

27	http://www.breitbart.com/california/2016/10/21/pension-california-supreme-court-may-allow-slashing/	California Supreme Court Set to Slash Public Pension Benefits	"For decades, California courts have prevented any cuts to luxurious public employee pensions, but the California Supreme Court is now reviewing arguments in a case that could allow slashing benefits.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERA three-judge California Appellate Court ruling in August declared that public employee retirement plans were not ""immutable,"" because employees only required a ""reasonable"" pension. The ruling was a shock to unions that have been able to sustain public pension spikes, even if they put cities like San Bernardino in bankruptcy.The appeal now before the California Supreme Court could have an impact that reverberates across the nation. Prior court rulings created what is referred to as the ""California Rule,"" which guaranteed government workers the pension that was in place on the day they were first hired.As a result, this ""first-in, always-in"" precedent legally perpetuated a California government system that is wildly insolvent to the tune of $484.2 billion. That works out to a stunning debt of about $77,700 for every household in the state, according to the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research ""U.S. Pension Tracker.""Law professors were stunned when the Court of Appeals came in with a unanimous ruling opening up the concept of ending public pensions as we know them. Under the ruling, a state, municipal or local government entity could terminate its current pension plan and start a new one that had significantly less luxurious benefits.The public employees would be able to keep the benefits they had earned, but they would not be ableto calculate their pension on the highest seniority grade they made or the greatest number of years of service. This also would stop the common practice of public employees maximizing overtime in their last 2 years of employment to spike benefits.According to Emory University law professor Sasha Volokh, the ""California Rule"" was created by the California Supreme Court in 1955 in a city charter amendment decision titled Allen v. City of Long Beach (Cal. 1955). The amendment sought to improve the city's solvency by raising the amount of employees' retirement contributions from 2 percent to 10 percent, and it changed the pension from a fluctuating amount to a fixed amount. It also required extra contributions from employees who had returned from military service.The court held that the amendment unconstitutionally impaired the contract rights of the employees who were adversely affected. It stated that the calculation of retirement income can only be changed if it is neutral or advantageous to the employee. It can never be reduced, except for new hires.The life of expectancy of an individual who started working for the government in 1925 at the age of 20 and working until they retired was 54 years old. That means that many public employees were dead before they could retire with 30 years for maximum benefits. But a public employee that started working for government in 1986 can expect to retire this year with 30 years of service and live until he or she is 79 years old.Following California's treatment of government employee pensions as contracts protected by the state constitution, there are now twelve other states that eventually adopted the equivalent of the ""California Rule.""The case now before the Supreme Court is the result of a ""pension reform"" law pushed by Governor Jerry Brown and passed by the Democrat-controlled legislature in 2012, when the state was teetering on the verge of bankruptcy. The law cuts pension costs by raising the retirement age for new government employees, and bans ""pension spiking"" for existing workers.The once-powerful state unions are that are appealing the decision contend that employees had long been promised that benefit and took jobs because of it.But Brown cleverly exempted the treatment of California judges' pensions under the law. The union's lawyer, Gregg McLean Adam, ruefully commented, ""They stuck it to pretty much everybody except the judges.""The title of the case is: ""MARIN ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES et al., Plaintiffs and Appellants, v.

29	http://www.breitbart.com/jerusalem/2016/10/21/south-africa-withdraw-international-criminal-court/	South Africa to Withdraw From International Criminal Court	"UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- South Africa has decided to withdraw from the International Criminal Court following a dispute last year over a visit by Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir (pictured), who is wanted by the tribunal for alleged war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe decision comes after another African nation, Burundi, this week signed legislation to become the first to withdraw from the ICC -- raising concerns that states have begun to act on years of threats to leave over what they call the court's disproportionate targeting of the continent.""It's important both for South Africa and the region that this runaway train be slowed down,"" Dewa Mavhinga, Human Rights Watch's Africa division senior researcher, said in a statement Friday.""Questions remain about whether the government even acted in line with its own laws for leaving the court,"" Mavhinga said.A copy of South Africa's ""Instrument of Withdrawal,"" dated Wednesday and signed by Foreign Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, was obtained Thursday by The Associated Press.It states that South Africa ""has found that its obligations with respect to the peaceful resolution of conflicts at times are incompatible with the interpretation given by the International Criminal Court of obligations contained in the Rome Statute"" which established the court.Under the Rome Statute, South Africa as a party to the ICC has an obligation to arrest anyone sought by the tribunal.The charges against al-Bashir stem from the bloodshed in Sudan's western Darfur region, which began in 2003 when rebels took up arms against the government in Khartoum, accusing it of discrimination and neglect. The United Nations says 300,000 people have died in the conflict and 2.7 million have fled their homes.In June 2015, al-Bashir went to South Africa to attend an African Union summit but the government didn't arrest him. A provincial court ordered him to remain in the country while judges deliberated on whether he should be arrested on the ICC warrants, but al-Bashir left for Sudan before the court ruled that he should indeed be arrested. The Supreme Court of Appeal later described the government's failure to arrest al-Bashir as ""disgraceful conduct.""The government said in a statement in late June 2015 that it would consider withdrawing from the International Criminal Court as a ""last resort"" following the dispute over al-Bashir. It cited ""contradictions"" in the statute and said South Africa would have found it difficult to arrest al-Bashir because of treaty obligations to the African Union.The African Union has asked the International Criminal Court to stop proceedings against sitting presidents and has said it will not compel any member states to arrest a leader on behalf of the ICC.South Africa's decision to quit the court follows Tuesday's announcement that Burundi's President Pierre Nkurunziza signed legislation to make his country the first to withdraw from the ICC, which had said it would investigate recent political violence there.No country has ever withdrawn from the ICC, which was established to prosecute cases of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.Burundi's decision to withdraw follows a bitter dispute with the international community over the human rights situation in the East African country. More than a year of deadly violence has followed Nkurunziza's controversial decision to pursue a third term, which some have called unconstitutional.According to South Africa's document, its withdrawal will take effect one year after UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is officially notified.UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said he was ""not confirming at this point"" whether Ban had received a withdrawal document from South Africa.SIGN UP"
