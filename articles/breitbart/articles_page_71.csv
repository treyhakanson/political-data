Indications are that the second salvo brought down an incoming missile, one U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.The renewed attempt to target the U.S. Navy destroyer will add pressure on the U.S. military to retaliate, a move that would represent the first direct U.S. military action against Houthis in Yemen's conflict. The Pentagon said it would respond ""at the appropriate time and in the appropriate manner.""The United States, a longtime ally of Saudi Arabia, has provided aerial refueling of jets from a Saudi-led coalition striking Yemen and it supplies U.S. weapons sales to the kingdom.Michael Knights, an expert on Yemen's conflict at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said the missile attacks appeared to be the Houthis' response to an attack last weekend, widely blamed on Saudi-led forces, on mourners gathered in Yemen's Houthi-held capital Sanaa.The White House says it is reviewing its support for Saudi-led forces in Yemen in the wake of Saturday's strike, which killed at least 140 people by one count.Knights said the targeting of U.S. warship suggested the Houthis, fighters from a Shi'ite sect that ruled a 1,000-year kingdom in northern Yemen until 1962, could be becoming more militarily aligned with groups like Lebanon's Shi'ite militant group Hezbollah.""Targeting U.S. warships is a sign that the Houthis have decided to join the axis of resistance that currently includes Lebanese Hezbollah, Hamas and Iran,"" Knight said.The USS Mason was also the target of a failed missile attack off Yemen on Sunday, and the Navy praised the resolve of sailors aboard the ship.""The team in USS Mason demonstrated initiative and toughness as they defended themselves and others against these unfounded attacks over the weekend and again today,"" the Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson said.""All Americans should be proud of them,"" he said.Read the rest of the story here.SIGN UP"

Authorities say they shattered her eye sockets, strangled her, broke her neck bone, raped her, and left her for dead.Pharis, described by her family as a ""gentle"" woman, desperately tried to fight back as she was pinned down in her own bed under the heavy weight of her assailant as he was crushing the bones in her face with his hammer, according to police.Pharis died a few days later in the hospital.The illegal alien accused of assaulting Pharis had been arrested six times in just the 15 months leading up to her rape and murder, but he was never removed from the country.There is no public record that House Speaker Paul Ryan has ever spoken out about Pharis' sexual assault.Instead, five months after Pharis' sexual assault, Speaker Ryan voted to grant federal funding to continue the sanctuary policies which local authorities say were responsible for Pharis' death.In 2014, when Pharis' assailant had been arrested on prior felony drug and sexual assault charges, ICE issued a detainer for the illegal alien, ""but the Santa Maria's sheriff's office declined to honor [ICE's detainer] because of a local sanctuary policy,"" wrote Senator Chuck Grassley's office. Instead the illegal alien with prior sexual assault charges was allowed to remain in the U.S.- eventually going on to brutally rape and kill Pharis, according to police. Local authorities said that the nation's federal immigration policies were to blame for her assault. ""I am not remiss to say that from Washington, D.C., to Sacramento, there's a blood trail into the bedroom of Marilyn Pharis,"" said Santa Maria Police Chief Ralph Martin.Yet late last year, when Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions tried to put forward a proposal that would have included language in the year-end omnibus spending bill to end Sanctuary Cities, Ryan failed to include the language in the bill. As a result, Ryan's omnibus allowed the lawless sanctuary cities policies and the victimization of innocent American women to continue.According to a 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office, there are 70,000 sexual offenses attached to the incarcerated criminal alien population.Ryan has remained passive and quiet as criminal aliens have assaulted tens of thousands of American women, but when an 11-year-old audio tape emerged of Donald Trump caught on a hot mic discussing women in crass terms, Ryan declared himself ""sickened"" and spoke out.""I am sickened by what I heard today,"" Ryan said in a statement, referring to Trump's lewd private locker-room style banter with Billy Bush.""Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified,"" he declared. ""I hope Mr. Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests.""The day after Paul Ryan was ""sickened"" by Trump's decade-old comments, police say a 35-year-old illegal immigrant from El Salvador broke into the home of a Texas family in the middle of the night, kidnapped the family's six-year-old daughter while her parents were asleep, took the girl to a park, and raped her.Police said that they were only able to find the child because someone had heard the little girl's screams. When the authorities found her, she immediately ran towards the police officers and was visibly ""very scared.""There is no public record of Speaker Ryan speaking out against the alleged sexual assault of this six-year-old girl, nor did Ryan seem to feel the need to take immediate actions that would prevent future assaults of this nature.Ryan's statement -- describing Trump's comments as ""sickening"" -- came the same night that WikiLeaks revealed that Hillary Clinton had privately told a group of foreign bankers that her ""dream"" was to enact ""open trade and open borders.""Speaker Ryan's record of open borders advocacy syncs up with Clinton's ""dream,"" as well as the agendas of wealthy Republican donors like the Koch brothers.The overwhelming similarities between the goals of establishment leaders in both political parties and the goals of their wealthy corporate donors recently prompted Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein to denounce Hillary Clinton as a corporatist and the face of ""#TheNewRepublicanParty."" ""Both Democrats and Republicans are funded by big corporate interests,"" Stein wrote, noting that these members of Washington's ""uniparty"" are united in their shared desire to advance the goals of their wealthy donors rather than the desires of the people.Indeed, several reports have documented how Ryan would likely accomplish more of his and the Republican Party's donor class legislative goals on foreign trade, foreign migration, and foreign wars if Hillary Clinton were in the White House than if Donald Trump were president.Throughout the election, several conservatives have argued that many of Ryan's statements and actions have seemed designed to undermine Trump and the Republican Party's chances of electoral success.Trump himself called out Ryan's lack of support on Twitter:Despite winning the second debate in a landslide (every poll), it is hard to do well when Paul Ryan and others give zero support!-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 11, 2016Our very weak and ineffective leader, Paul Ryan, had a bad conference call where his members went wild at his disloyalty.-- Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2016The day after Trump's strong debate performance against Clinton, Ryan made headlines by telling GOP House members that he would not defend their party's nominee, who was overwhelmingly selected by the Republican voters whom Ryan is supposed to represent. At the same time, former Ryan adviser Dan Senor urged members of corporate media not to talk about Trump's success at the debate, but to instead focus on the decade-old leaked audio recording of Trump and Billy Bush.""Note to media: if interviewing Trump surrogates today, focus q's on tape. Besides Rudy, these surrogates were all hiding over the weekend,"" Senor tweeted. ""Now Trump surrogates magically appear b/c debate wasn't a disaster. You shld intv them abt the tape, as though the debate never occurred.""Ryan's office did not respond to a request for comment.Despite winning the second debate in a landslide (every poll), it is hard to do well when Paul Ryan and others give zero support!

Trump's chances of defeating Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Speaker has fallen back in line with the Trump campaign and has begun delivering the campaign's core message for the day.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERLate Wednesday afternoon, Ryan's team issued a statement from the Speaker on the emails that surfaced via WikiLeaks showing the Hillary Clinton campaign's spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri's disdain for Catholics. Ryan said in the statement:The Clinton campaign's disdain for the Catholic faith and Christian evangelicals is staggering. Catholicism has been the catalyst for the creation of hospitals, orphanages, and much of the university system across the world. To disparage the Catholic Church as 'severely backwards' is an insult to millions of people across the nation. If anything, these statements reveal the Clinton campaign's hostile attitude toward people of faith in general. This is the United States of America--for centuries, people fled to our shores to find refuge from religious persecution. All Americans of faith should take a long, hard look at this and decide if these are the values we want to be represented in our next president. If Hillary Clinton continues to employ people with biased and bigoted views, it's clear where her priorities lie.That statement falls in line with what the Trump campaign had pushed on a conference call with reporters earlier on Wednesday.""The hostility to religious liberty and the beliefs that we hold as Catholics should not go unnoticed or unpunished,"" Trump campaign manager KellyAnne Conway said on the call. ""We call on Hillary Clinton to apologize and to fire the staff who have engaged in this vicious anti-Catholic bigotry. All of this shows who these people are at the core.""The Clinton campaign's disdain for the Catholic faith and Christian evangelicals is staggering.

Case is now pending. This is going to be explosive with women voters as they understand what could happen, with a huge majority of women strongly supporting contraceptives.The line is that the current court could put contraceptives under siege, or if contraceptives prevail in the pending case 5-4 a Republican president would name one of more justices, if they have a vacancy or two, who would go after contraceptives.Interestingly, Budowsky also admits there are many women who do not support abortion, a fact that the abortion industry and groups such as Planned Parenthood attempt to sweep under the rug.He continues:This is different than the abortion issue. Women overwhelmingly support contraceptives emotionally and in large majorities, and men also support contraceptives, and this includes a large majority of Catholic women and men and moderate evangelicals.My advice is HRC raise this issue soon, aggressively and visibly. If possible before the coming Republican debate. This is a powerful, powerful issue.The real religious issue is that the right wants to impose its sectarian view of religion on all Americans on contraceptives. A huge and emotional majority would agree with HRC on contraceptives and the sooner and stronger she raises this issue, the better, IMO. BrentDuring the 2012 presidential debates, former Clinton operative and debate moderator George Stephanopoulos introduced a non-existent issue of whether a Republican president would want to take away women's birth control.""If you go back to the previous presidential debates, many people have brought up that the whole questioning about birth control was originated as a campaign theme by Stephanopoulos and there's questions about whether that was done in coordination with Democrats,"" Republican Sen. Rand Paul (KY) said subsequently.

Hours earlier, Trump hosted a rally two hours north in Ocala, FL and questioned whether his opponent, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, could hold up under a similar rigorous schedule.""How many of these do you think Hillary can do in a day?"" he asked a crowd that booed at the first mention of Clinton.The GOP nominee took his obligatory jabs at the news media -- a staple at his rallies. He directed the attention of his audience to the press pool.""I tell you, these are the most dishonest people you'll ever see,"" Trump said. ""You should be ashamed of yourselves.""Throughout the rally, whenever CNN would attempt a live shot, rally attendees would break out into chants of ""CNN sucks.""Trump addressed accusations from Clinton that he invaded her ""personal space"" during last Sunday's presidential debate. According to Trump, it was quite the opposite.""Believe me, the last space I want to invade is hers,"" Trump joked.The Republican nominee finds himself behind in both national and Florida statewide polls, down six and two respectively, according to the Real Clear Politics average.""I think we're going to have a little Brexit coming up in November,"" he said.Throughout the event, Trump reminded attendees of the stakes of the November election and warned if Hillary Clinton were elected, it would set a new precedent.""She would be the most dishonest, most corrupt person ever elected to high office,"" Trump declared. ""The WikiLeaks emails showed the Department of Justice fed information to Clinton.Trump also doubled-down on his hint from the second presidential debate, in which he replied to Clinton's suggestion that it was a good thing Trump wasn't in charge of the justice system by saying Clinton would be ""in jail"" if he were.""Folks, what's happening in our country - it's a disgrace,"" he said. ""In fact, she lied in front of Congress to such an extent - I tell you what, I'm thoroughly disappointed in Congress, both Republican and Democrat, that they don't find a way to do something.""""She deleted the emails,"" he added.

If that pace continues for the remaining 354 days of FY 2017, a total of 20,075 Syrian refugees will be resettled in the United States during the fiscal year.As a point of comparison, only eleven Syrian refugees were resettled in the United States during the first eleven days of October 2015, one per day. In FY 2016, which ended on September 30, more than 12,500 Syrian refugees arrived in the country. More than 99 percent of these refugees were Muslim.The Obama administration began accelerating the pace of Syrian refugee resettlement in May 2016.During the first seven months of FY 2016, between October 1, 2016 and April 30, 2016, a total of 1,736 Syrian refugees were resettled in the United States, an average of 248 per month.But in the last five months of FY 2016, between May 1, 2016 and September 30, 2016, a total of 10,851 Syrian refugees were resettled in the United States, an average of 2,170 per month.All told, 12, 587 Syrian refugees were resettled in the United States in FY 2016. The pace of resettlement in FY 2017 so far, however, is about the same as the pace of resettlement in the last five months of FY 2016.Syrian refugees arriving in the United States in FY 2017 have not been distributed evenly across the fifty states.Michigan has received by far the most Syrian refugees of any state. Fifteen percent of the 608 Syrian refugees who have arrived during the first eleven days of FY 2017, or 101, have been resettled in Michigan.Sixty-two Syrian refugees were resettled in California, 57 in Texas, 47 in Maryland, 42 in Arizona, 39 in Pennsylvania, 29 in Ohio, 27 in New York, 19 in Georgia, and 18 in Nevada. The remaining 167 were resettled in seventeen other states, a little more than nine per state. Twenty-three states received no resettled Syrian refugees at all.One county alone in Michigan, Oakland County, received 41 refugees, more than 45 states.A second county in Michigan, Macomb County, received 28 refugees, more than 43 states.Oakland County Executive L. Brooks Patterson has said he intends to sue the federal government for its placement of refugees in the county, on the grounds the federal government has failed to comply with the clause of the Refugee Act of 1980 that requires both the federal government and the director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement to consult with the local and state government officials prior to the placement of refugees within their respective jurisdictions. To date, no such consultation has taken place with Oakland County officials.The significant increase in the number of Syrian refugees coming to the United States (up from 2,300 total over the four years between FY 2012 and FY 2015) has been accomplished by an acceleration of the time taken in the ""vetting "" process-from a year and half to two years before FY 2016, to the current three months.Critics maintain that there is no way these refugees can be properly vetted from a security perspective.One of those critics, in a private speech delivered to a group in Chicago in 2013, was Hillary Clinton, as Breitbart reported previously:The WikiLeaks document dump of Hillary Clinton's paid speeches revealed the Democratic nominee told a private group in 2013 that the country of Jordan ""can't possibly vet all those [Syrian] refugees ... so they don't know if ... jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees.""Clinton's remarks, made in an October 28, 2013, speech to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago's Vanguard Luncheon, for which she was paid $400,000, according to the Citizen Uprising website, are in stark contrast to the public position she has taken during her current campaign for president.Publicly, however, Clinton has said since 2015 she plans to increase the number of Syrian refugees resettled in the United States to 65,000 annually.Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and running mate Mike Pence, in contrast, ""are committed to suspending the Syrian refugee program and programs and immigration from areas of the world that have been compromised by terrorism.""If elected president in November, Clinton would face little effective political resistance in accelerating the number of Syrian refugees resettled in the United States in FY 2017 from the current Obama administration pace of 20,000 for the year to her stated goal of 65,000 annually.Local and state governments, however, could still mount legal challenges on failure to comply with the consultation clause of the Refugee Act of 1980, as Oakland County, Michigan anticipates. States that have withdrawn from the federal refugee resettlement program, like Tennessee, also can mount legal challenges on Tenth Amendment grounds.The WikiLeaks document dump of Hillary Clinton's paid speeches revealed the Democratic nominee told a private group in 2013 that the country of Jordan ""can't possibly vet all those [Syrian] refugees ... so they don't know if ... jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees.""

Democrats will take zero responsibility for pummeling hard-working families with skyrocketing insurance premiums and out-of-pocket expenses--they'll weaponize those burdens against the GOP, portraying all who resist their demands as heartless monsters who don't want to give working moms a break.ObamaCare's victims have been absolutely invisible to the media, able to do little beyond posting their tales of woe in blog talkbacks and social media... but when it's time for the great Democrat crusade to ""fix"" the problem they created, you had better believe the individual anecdotes of downtrodden folks who can't afford decent health care will return with a vengeance. They'll all be repeating Democrat talking points about ""strengthening"" ObamaCare.This is how Democrat programs always work. They're very good at spending huge amounts of public money to create problems, and then claiming only an even bigger government can solve them.

Republicans won't be congratulated for their foresight in predicting all this--they'll be told they have a moral imperative to submit and sign off on the bailouts needed to keep the system floating, or stand aside and let the people who saddled us with ObamaCare impose the even greater, endless nightmare of single-payer socialized medicine. Democrats will take zero responsibility for pummeling hard-working families with skyrocketing insurance premiums and out-of-pocket expenses--they'll weaponize those burdens against the GOP, portraying all who resist their demands as heartless monsters who don't want to give working moms a break.ObamaCare's victims have been absolutely invisible to the media, able to do little beyond posting their tales of woe in blog talkbacks and social media... but when it's time for the great Democrat crusade to ""fix"" the problem they created, you had better believe the individual anecdotes of downtrodden folks who can't afford decent health care will return with a vengeance. They'll all be repeating Democrat talking points about ""strengthening"" ObamaCare.This is how Democrat programs always work. They're very good at spending huge amounts of public money to create problems, and then claiming only an even bigger government can solve them. ObamaCare's collapse shouldn't have been allowed to occur so quietly during the presidential race to date, and in the remaining weeks, it should not be critiqued as an isolated debacle--it's the perfect model of what Democrat ""governance"" means in practice, from broken promises to weaponized failures."

However, after the DNC reformed the system, they made it account for over 15% and, according to Siegel, ""DNC ADDED THEMSELVES as automatic delegates.""Siegel  recognizes the fact that Senator Bernie Sanders people are not happy about the super delegates, especially since most of them came out in support of Clinton.""Bernie and his people have been bitching about super delegates and the huge percentage that have come out for Hillary"" Siegel said.""Why not throw Bernie a bone and reduce the super delegates in the future of the original draft of members of the House and Senate, governors and big city mayors, eliminating the DNC members who are not State chairs or vice-Chairs. (Frankly, DNC members don't really represent constituencies anyway. I should know. I served on the DNC first as Executive Director and then as an elected member for 10 years.)""Siegel went on to say, ""So if we 'give' Bernie this in the Convention's rules committee, his people will think they've 'won' something from the Party Establishment. And it functionally doesn't make any difference anyway. They win. We don't lose.

John McCain and House Speaker Paul Ryan. SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""We're only doing this in two races -- we're not batting for the other team,"" said William Gheen, the founder of Americans for Legal Immigration PAC. ""Just these two, just this time,"" he said, because their defeat will deter establishment-wing Republicans from joining the Democrats in 2017 to push for a nation-changing amnesty. ""We're looking at this battle from the national level, and on the national level we need people in these local districts to vote for the Democrats to save the nation"" from amnesty, he said.

Gheen's group played a major role in Cantor's defeat, which killed off President Barack Obama's push for an immigration-expanding ""Comprehensive Immigration Reform"" in 2014, he said.

""We can kick out two RINO Republicans every election year... it could turn out to a very powerful political weapon,"" against the business-backed establishment, he said. It is a powerful weapon because even a small percentage of GOP supporters in many districts can flip the result away from the establishment by giving a temporary gain to the Democrats, he said. But to defeat Ryan, roughly 40,000 of his supporters, or about 22 percent of his 2014 support, must flip over to the Democrat.  The same proportion of party switching is also needed to defeat McCain in Arizona.Still, many GOP voters are strong advocates for pro-American immigration reform, which would curb legal immigration until Americans' living standards recover and start rising again. For example, 35 percent of the GOP's primary vote in Wisconsin and 47 percent of the the Arizona primary vote went to Donald Trump this year.Gheen's group is nominating McCain and Ryan for defeat because of their long-standing and determined advocacy for amnesty, he said.

(ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images)Quick's pledge came in response to an e-mail that appears to have been sent by Erskine Bowles, the former president of the University of North Carolina and the former chairperson of President Barack Obama's National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform.In the April 11, 2014, e-mail, Bowles wrote to Quick to praise Burwell in the wake of the negative news coverage surrounding the appointment. ""I listen to some of the talk today about Sylvia's move to HHS,"" wrote Bowles. ""As you may recall, I picked Sylvia and John Podesta to be my two Deputy Chiefs of Staff. I picked Sylvia not only because she is brilliant (Rhodes), really Becky Quick like nice, informed and smart, but most importantly to me she knows how to run a large organization and run it effectively. ... Regardless of your politics, any American should be glad that the President picked someone so competent to head such a critically important agency.""Less than three minutes later, Quick promised to ""defend"" Burwell. ""Thanks so much for the note--anyone with your recommendation is good by me,"" wrote Quick. ""Wish I'd seen this earlier while we were still blabbering! I'm out the first two days of next week but will make sure to defend her when things get further along in the nomination process.""Bowles later forwarded the e-mails to Podesta, who thanked him, writing, ""This will help a lot and I think at the end of the day most of these Senators will come through... At any rate, thanks for coming thru as you always do. Love to Crandall and hope you'll come to the Casa Podesta upcoming dinner to celebrate Sylvia's swearing in.""Burwell has faced much controversy since being named secretary of Health and Human Services, a position she continues to hold, primarily because of her role as the chief defender of the Affordable Care Act.Quick, who is also the anchorwoman of CNBC's On the Money, is married to Matt Quayle, an influential executive producer at CNBC. She has previously worked as a reporter for The Wall Street Journal and as a columnist for Fortune.CNBC moderator Becky Quick, Jim Brett, President of West Elm, Karen Appleton, founder of Box.org, John Chambers, Executive Chairman for Cisoc, Erica Kochi, Senior Advisor to UNICEF Executive Director on Innovation & Co-founder, UNICEF Innovation and John McFarlane, Chairman of Barclay's take part in a panel discussion during the third day of the 2015 Clinton Global Initiative's Annual Meeting at the Sheraton New York Hotel & Towers on September 28, 2015 in New York City. (JP Yim/Getty Images)Quick's pledge to protect Burwell on CNBC comes hours and days after other reports of media bias have surfaced, also thanks to e-mails discovered through WikiLeaks' Podesta e-mail database.Some examples of that bias include CNBC correspondent John Harwood's close relationship with Podesta; evidence CNN contributor Donna Brazile secretly e-mailed debate questions to Clinton prior to a debate with Bernie Sanders; and one e-mail showing Clinton Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri editing a New York Times reporter's story on an interview he had with Clinton.It is undeniable WikiLeaks' Podesta e-mails prove many in the mainstream media cannot be trusted to report fairly or accurately. Americans must realize this and seek sources of information that will present facts fairly and honestly. This doesn't mean media outlets must be devoid of opinion journalism--that's probably impossible to accomplish in today's world--but it does mean people should only trust hard news reporters who aren't colluding closely with politicians and their closest advisers.Is that really too much to ask for?Justin Haskins (jhaskins@heartland.org) is executive editor of The Heartland Institute.SIGN UP"

13	http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/12/top-seven-examples-hillarys-bad-judgement/	Penny Nance: Seven Examples of Hillary Clinton’s Bad Judgment	"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton says repeatedly that her record speaks for itself.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERI agree. The message? ""Danger Ahead!""Clinton's incredibly poor judgment follows her wherever she goes. Just taking the last eight years (not to pound on the infamous scandals of the 1990s), after she lost her first presidential bid to President Obama, show a disturbing pattern. Here are what I found to be the top seven most disturbing cases of bad judgment in the last eight years, in no particular order:As Planned Parenthood spiraled out of control, exposed for unethical -- if not illegal and disgusting -- activities, Hillary Clinton stood steadfast at their side, no questions asked. Instead, she turned on the investigators, as well as the accusers (I'm seeing a pattern there), despite the evidence, as she has done so many times before, saying, ""I think it is unfortunate that Planned Parenthood has been the object of such a concerted attack for so many years. And it's really an attack against a woman's right to choose. ... I'm hoping this situation will not further undermine the very important services that Planned Parenthood provides across our country.""It is no secret that the appointment of Supreme Court justices by the next president has become a major issue in the campaign.  It's also no secret that Hillary has immense support for the recent court rulings that have progressed further and further away from constitutional democracy and closer and closer to a bizarre set of legislative authority from the court. The lower courts, too, have taken such a turn. On issues important to many Americans -- from safer abortion clinics to religious freedom to the definition of marriage to ObamaCare's government overreach -- the court has gone too far.At the most recent debate, she was asked about the types of justices she would appoint, and she didn't even mention the Constitution, only the decisions she wants (Roe was, of course, at the top):I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world works, who have real-life appearance, maybe they tried more cases, understand what people are up against.  I think the current Court has gone in the wrong direction, so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark money out of our politics. Donald doesn't support that. Voting rights are a big part of our country, we don't always do everything to ensure that everybody can exercise their franchise.  I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade. And Donald Trump has put together some candidates, and they will reverse Roe v. Wade and marriage equality.Hillary saw fit to set up her own e-mail server processing classified information. Many Americans don't understand the full extent of the problems here. She was not just using a personal e-mail address; she was using a separate server to escape government oversight. She left that server exposed to all kinds of hacking of national security information that we must now assume are in anyone's hands. The casual handling of classified information is disturbing enough, but so are the attempts to cover it all up. At first, she said there was no classified material, a claim later repudiated by FBI Director James Comey.Her IT guys pled the Fifth Amendment to avoid giving full information at the investigative hearing; many are being given immunity, even though they don't give any information, and we may never know the full extent of the layers of this scandal.Hillary was in support of Obama's policies to reduce our military presence in the Middle East, specifically in Iraq, an act which many experts say gave rise to ISIS in the region. ISIS atrocities have now spread across the globe, manifesting in everything from the shocking attacks on regular western lives at concerts and event venues, to forced sex trafficking of minority religious sects, to stealing and radicalizing young people through cyber recruitment, to horrifying religious persecution and murder of Christians. Meanwhile, Clinton minimizes the flagrant persecutions and, like President Obama, even refuses to call the problem what it is: radical Islamic terrorism.During Clinton's role as Secretary of State, there were also quite serious reports of mismanagement. Of particular concern is how she ignored the pleas for help in Libya which led directly to the Benghazi attacks and the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens. Her reactions after the fact were even more concerning. She flagrantly lied, pretending she had nothing to do with it, and her shameful deceptions about a YouTube video causing the attacks are embarrassingly dangerous. What sort of tricks could she pull when given the full power of the presidency?Behind the philanthropic facade, the Clinton Foundation has been plagued with scandals, all pointing to the undisputable fact that Secretary Clinton's position and influence was used by the foundation for the personal and organizational financial gain of the Clintons and their friends. As PJ Media reports:The Clinton Foundation dispenses contracts to Clinton cronies like Doug Band while also paying for the non-political travel of the Clintons and staffers. It's all perfectly legal -- and disgustingly unethical. The Foundation is used as a slush fund that enriches friends of the Clintons while allowing foreign businesses and governments to purchase influence.If you don't agree with Hillary, there's a 50 percent chance you are simply ""deplorable."" Clinton's critique of Trump supporters claimed this half was full of those who were ""racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic, you name it."" This shouldn't simply be taken as a flippant comment in the heat of election season -- it's a serious look at how Clinton really feels about views that challenge her own, and more importantly, how she attacks political opponents.

The truth, as the two transparent yellow arrows we have added to the graph shows, is that from 1860-1880 as well as from 1910-1940 the rate of global warming was the same as from 1980-2005. There has been no acceleration.John Linder, the GOP ranking member on the committee (for the House was still under ""Democrat"" control at that time) took one look at the graph and said, ""They can't have done that!"" He turned to his fellow-members and said, ""Gentlemen, we have now seen all we need to see. The UN and its climate panel are anti-scientific and untrustworthy."" And so they are. The GOP has had no time for these scamsters ever since.Both of us have had long experience of tackling the falsehoods peddled by Gore, Clinton and the self-serving UN Let us knock some of them on the head.First, the rate of global warming has not been accelerating. In fact, it is little more than half of what the UN had predicted in 1990, even though, despite the squandering of hundreds of billions on the climate scam, CO2 emissions are rising faster than predicted.Secondly, Hurricane Matthew was no worse for global warming. Until it struck the U.S. coast, no hurricane of category 3 or more had made landfall for 4001 days - the longest period without a major hurricane landfall in the U.S. since records began almost 150 years ago. Warmer weather reduces the temperature differentials that drive storms, making severe hurricanes less likely.Thirdly, sea level, which Gore and Clinton said was a big issue for Florida's coastline, has not been accelerating, though the south-eastern seaboard of the U.S. has been subsiding.Fourthly, there is no ""consensus"". Two of us were co-authors of a paper printed last year that examined 11,944 peer-reviewed papers on climate and related subject published in the learned journals over the 21 years 1991-2001. Just 41 papers - 0.3 percent of the sample - went as far as to say that what little global warming there has been in recent decades was mostly manmade.In 2007, one of us ran ads in major daily papers throughout the U.S. challenging Al Gore to a debate about global warming. He was too terrified to accept. In 2009, one of us asked him how much global warming would be prevented if the U.S. stopped emitting CO2 altogether. Gore could not answer: for the truth is that global temperature would barely change.The cost of compliance with the Paris climate agreement has been estimated at $90 trillion over the next 14 years. Yet that monstrous sum - four times the entire federal debt - would not even reduce global temperature by a tenth of a degree.Measures to tackle global warming that are inexpensive enough to be ineffective will be unaffordable. Measures that are expensive enough to be effective are unaffordable. And there is no climate crisis anyway. As a recent Pew survey showed, the global warming scam is now a vote-loser for its promoters. We, the people, are no longer fooled.SIGN UP"

Until then she had made no public stance.""We are trying to find a good way to leak her opposition to the pipeline without her having to actually say it and give up her principled stand about not second-guessing the president in public,"" wrote speechwriter Dan Schwerin.Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook came up with a different solution: publicly state her opposition. That ""will solicit criticism... but that might help distract from emails,"" he said, according to the leaked messages.The controversy over Clinton's use of a private email server while she was the Obama administration's top diplomat was in full swing at the time, forcing her to publicly apologize for its use in September.The idea of publishing an op-ed article stating her opposition to Keystone was also discussed.""Given that we just offered an apology on emails that some reporters think happened 'on a dime' after months of resistance, do we worry that publishing an oped... will be greeted cynically and perhaps as part of some manufactured attempt to project sincerity?,"" wrote campaign spokesman Brian Fallon.Clinton eventually announced her opposition to Keystone at a campaign rally in late September 2015.The emails recently released by WikiLeaks also reveal Clinton was wary of supporting a bill to separate commercial and investment banks, a financial reform championed by Sanders and the left wing of the Democratic Party.""I understand that we face phoniness charges if we 'change' our position"" by supporting the law, wrote campaign aide Mandy Grunwald. ""But we face political risks this way, too.""Clinton ended up refusing to support such a law.In other documents recently released by WikiLeaks, Clinton, in private speeches to major banks in 2013 and 2014, expressed views in favor of free trade and Wall Street self-regulation that are at odds with her positions as a candidate.Clinton won the Democratic presidential nomination in July of this year.Her campaign has accused anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks of releasing documents to help Republican rival Donald Trump in the race for the White House.SIGN UP"

Palmieri suggested that many prominent right-wing Catholics join the church out of social considerations. ""I imagine they think it is the most socially acceptable politically conservative religion,"" she wrote. ""Their rich friends wouldn't understand if they became evangelicals.""Palmieri on Wednesday did not deny writing the email in question but told reporters that she ""didn't recognize it.""Asked if she didn't write the email, Palmieri says, ""I said didn't recognize it,"" but adds that they won't authenticate specific emails.-- Ruby Cramer (@rubycramer) October 12, 2016Newt Gingrich, a Trump supporter, also joined the call, blasting Clinton's ""bigoted, anti-Christian, anti-Catholic staff.""""Now we know what Hillary meant by 'deplorables' -- it was people of faith,"" Gingrich reacted to the email.He said that this should raise concerns to voters about the Supreme Court justices Clinton would appoint, suggesting she would select the ""most anti-religious liberty"" and ""anti-free speech"" justices.Matt Schlapp, who serves as a member of Trump's Catholic advisory group, echoed Conway's call to punish those involved in the anti-Catholic rhetoric.""We've all watched this campaign and the public discourse...now we know when the cameras are off and the doors are closed what senior campaign officials think about us.

The essay, written by Marie Claire, was in draft form at the time emails were being exchanged, and Clinton had been asked to contribute to it. As a result, staffers were trying to decide whether to include Davis' shooting death or discard it.Campaign director of engagement, De'Ara Balenger, reviewed the draft, then emailed:This is great. My edits are attached. The only flag here is that Jordan Davis was killed by a white man, so arguably - this crime was racially motivated, which takes this outside the discussion of gun violence. Was there another mother in the Chicago meeting where the shooting was NOT racially motivated? If yes, we should use that story instead of Jordan Davis.Staffer Corey Ciorciari replied, ""You know where I stand on this. It can be racially motivated and gun violence should still very much be part of the discussion. Even more so here given that Jordan's mom is one of the leading gun violence prevention proponents in the country.""In the end, the story of Jordan Davis being shot and killed did not make the final cut for Hillary Clinton's contribution to the essay. Instead, Clinton wrote a plea to domestic abuse victims and moms in general, tossing in a mention of firearm-related child deaths, as well:Maybe someone you love has been affected by domestic violence, and you care about keeping guns away from abusers. Maybe you love hunting but think felons shouldn't be able to buy handguns. Maybe you're a mom who wants guns nowhere near your kids. Maybe you have a gun in your home for protection and went through a background check to get it and think there's absolutely nothing wrong with other people having to do the same. Or maybe you're just deeply concerned about a political system that can't get the most basic law passed, even as thousands of children die.Whatever your reason, I hope you'll join me in insisting that ending gun violence is a priority in this election.It should be noted that Clinton's suggestion that ""thousands of children die"" from guns is not accurate. The left justifies such phraseology by counting teens under the age of 18 as children. This allows them to use teens who are prime age for gang activity-ages 15 to 17-as examples of children who have been killed with guns.Either way, Jordan Davis' death did not make the final cut for Clinton's essay.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

23	http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/12/opec-agrees-production-decrease-prices-increase-just-right/	OPEC Agrees to Production Decrease, Prices Increase	"At the end of September, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) surprised the markets by agreeing to a production cut. As soon as the 14-nation deal was announced, oil prices jumped more than five percent to some of the highest levels since the crash two years ago.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe proposed output cap represents a shift in the ""pump-at-will policy,"" as Bloomberg called it, ""the group adopted in 2014 at the instigation of Saudi Arabia.""Many analysts see that the Saudi gamble, aimed at putting American producers out of business, as a failure. While U.S. oil production decreased from last year's highs and bankruptcies are up, the industry has become more efficient and the cost of extracting oil from shale is continuing to come down--resulting in the sixth straight week of an increased rig count and the 15th without a decrease. Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reports: ""Many oil producers believe drilling in some U.S. regions can be profitable even with oil prices in their current range of $40 to $50 a barrel.""Additionally, U.S. crude stockpiles have fallen for the fifth consecutive week--as have crude imports. American drivers are consuming more gasoline than ever. Exploration budgets, due to the low oil prices, have been slashed with the predicted result of lower production in the next few years. It appears that demand is catching up with production and prices have been creeping up since February's lows. Phil Flynn, senior market analyst with the PRICE Futures Group explains: ""While supply is still at a historically high level for this time of year, strong U.S. demand and rising U.S. exports are cutting down the glut.""Meanwhile, the social costs of low-priced oil have been high for OPEC members--hitting Saudi Arabia especially hard. The cartel's biggest producer has lost billions of dollars of revenue, which has resulted in a 20 percent pay cut for its ministers, reductions in financial benefits for government employees, and an increase in fees and fines, and cuts in subsidies, for all in the kingdom. Fear that the loss of the coddled lifestyle could throw the country into chaos, according to industry veteran and consultant Allen Brooks, likely convinced Saudi Arabian officials to moderate their position.Iran, OPECs other majordomo, has, due to sanctions, gotten used to austerity and is now seeing its economic pressures easing and its oil exports increasing. It, therefore, heading into the OPEC meeting, appeared to be rejecting the Saudi output offer and dashed hopes of a compromise to cut crude production. The Financial Times quotes one Gulf OPEC delegate as saying: ""All producers are hurting.""The surprise came on Wednesday, September 28, when, after two years of failed attempts at an agreement and months of dialogue leading up to the meeting, ""Saudi Arabia agreed to take on the bulk of OPEC's proposed cuts,"" wrote the WSJ. The headline from the New York Times read: ""OPEC agrees to cut production, sending oil prices soaring.""The proposed cuts are moderate in reality, only 1-2 percent of the 14-nation cartel's 33.2 million barrels a day of production and they represent less than 1 percent of total global production. Yet, the announcement buoyed markets and added power to the previously mentioned price momentum. According to CNN Money, the agreement offers ""powerful symbolism.""While the price of oil received a bounce from the news that has given the industry cautious optimism, it is not expected to have a big impact on the price of gasoline. Oil prices are now expected to stay near $50 a barrel through the end of the year and below $60 a barrel through 2017--which will likely mean an increase of a few cents a gallon at the pump. Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economic, in CNN Money, called the situation ""a period of 'Goldilocks' oil prices""--low enough to help consumer spending and ""high enough to keep major producers afloat.""The slight bump in prices the proposed deal adds to the upward trend is enough to send some producers back into the oil field and encourage another burst of drilling. That increased production will have a self-leveling effect on prices. As prices go up, production increases. As more oil enters the already-glutted market, prices come down.Additionally, the OPEC agreement is only a plan. It isn't finalized. That could happen in Vienna in November if, and it is a big if, the members can agree on who will make the cuts, when the cuts will go into effect, how long they will last, and how they will be enforced. While all 14 countries--and non-OPEC producers such as the U.S. and Russia--will benefit from higher prices, no one wants to be the one taking the cut. Iran, Libya, and Nigeria are all trying to increase production that has been stifled due to sanctions or conflict. Plus, as WSJ reports: ""OPEC has a long history of agreeing to production cuts, only to have the pact collapse when countries change their minds."" CNN Money adds: ""cartel members also have a tendency to overshoot production quotas.""So, while the OPEC announcement is ""not a game-changing move that will send oil prices shooting back up towards the $100 a barrel level,"" as The Guardian reported, it is big news that brightens prospects for the energy industry while keeping things just right for consumers.The author of Energy Freedom, Marita Noon serves as the executive director for Energy Makes America Great Inc., and the companion educational organization, the Citizens' Alliance for Responsible Energy (CARE).

(The message was included in the John Podesta emails released by Wikileaks.)To get the message and Clinton footage to Priorities USA, they would use EMILY's List to film video of Hillary Clinton and send ""smoke signals.""""It gets us many of the benefits without some of the risks,"" wrote Shur. While he recommends the ""smoke signals"" strategy, it is one of two options -- the first being ""coordinated issue advocacy ads with Priorities.""EMILY's List, he explained, would publicly post suggested themes and portions of the video to send a message to Super PACs. It is unclear whether the campaign implemented their strategy or whether EMILY's List agreed to serving as a third party surrogate for the campaign.But the Clinton campaign had already advanced the idea to the level of a conference call with senior staff.""Ultimately, these determinations are up to EL (Emily's List), but there is no restriction on HFA's ability to make suggestions or recommendations,"" he wrote.Read the strategy memo below:Hi everyone -In advance of today's call with HRC, following several discussions we had today with Marc, we wanted to send a quick update on where our recommendations stand:The decision before us is whether to (1) pursue coordinated issue advocacy ads with Priorities (where we'd be breaking new ground) or (2) send public smoke signals in a more traditional way to the Priorities IE. We're recommending option 2, as it gets us many of the benefits without some of the risks. Assuming the Priorities IE picks up the signals and airs the ads, it would save the campaign anywhere from $2-4M (depending on how long they're on air for).To execute the strategy, we recommend the following:O We work with the hard side of Emily's List, as they have both a coordinated and IE sideO Emily's List coordinated side would need to shoot its own footage with its own consultants, but our consultants can be involved. Under this plan, EL would do a shoot with HRC asap - done by EL consultants, but with ours there too. (We may also invite EL crew to a town hall.) O EL would then post portions of the video to a designated page on its public website - and would include on that page suggested themes/media market targets to its website. Ultimately, these determinations are up to EL, but there is no restriction on HFA's ability to make suggestions or recommendations. This page would serve as a signal to Priorities, other IE's and other allied organizations.O The key to making this plan work is getting a shoot on the schedule asap. We would also get HFA footage from the shoot, which we also very much need.Hi everyone -

Current services and assistance for survivors were under-funded and varied in quality, it added,"" reports BBC.The British news outlet acknowledges:Thousands of members of the religious minority were abducted in Iraq in 2014.The hundreds who have so far escaped captivity have ended up living in dire conditions with impoverished relatives or at camps, according to Amnesty.Several have attempted suicide or have sisters or children who took their own lives due to the abuse they endured.Amnesty said much more needed to be done to ensure they received the necessary care and support they urgently required to rebuild their lives.United Nations human rights investigators revealed that Yazidi women and girls as young as nine were treated as ""spoils of war"" and openly sold in slave markers or provided as ""gifts.""""Survivors who escaped told the investigators that they had endured brutal rapes, often on a daily basis,"" points out BBC.Some of the surviving victims residing in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region are suffering from bouts of severe depression, anger, and suicidal thoughts, according to Amnesty International's researchers.""Seventh, who was 17 when she was abducted with her mother and four siblings, said she was raped and assaulted repeatedly in captivity, and that her captors also beat her three-month-old baby and periodically starved them,"" notes BBC. ""She tried to kill herself three times, but other captives stopped her.""According to Amnesty, Seventh continued to suffer from severe physical and psychological issues for her ordeal and remained concerned about her younger sister, Nermeen, who killed herself after escaping by setting herself on fire.Under mounting pressure, the Obama administration finally conceded in March that ISIS was committing genocide against ethno-religious minorities in the Middle East, including Yazidis, Christians, and Shiite Turkmen.Breitbart News spoke to representatives from the religious minorities who welcomed the move.Khalid Sulaiman Haider, a Yazidi activist originally from the Iraqi border town of Sinjar who now lives in the U.S. because of threats against him, told Breitbart News:Throughout the history of Middle East there had been military genocide campaigns against the indigenous ones, but it's never reached to what it's like today. What happened to the Yezidis, Christians and other minorities in both Iraq and Syria is nothing but the result of gross negligence from some governments in Iraq and other regional governments.However, members of the ethno-religious minority groups in the Middle East - including Yazidis -- told Breitbart News that the Obama administration's genocide declaration had failed to change much and amounted to all talk and no action.Yazidis are still suffering, thousands of them remained in ISIS' captivity, and many religious minorities had been living in worse conditions after the genocide declaration, learned Breitbart News.Haider told Breitbart News a few months after America's genocide declaration:So far everything is nothing but a show, or shall I call it political game that Mr. President Obama has played...Honestly, the religious minorities have been living in far worse conditions since the genocide declaration. Because the Kurds are using the method of slow genocide, by burning trash around the refugees camps, not allowing food, and other necessities to flow to the Sinjar mountain region in northern Iraq, not even a simple NGO. Please be advised that the genocide will happen again if this keeps going the way it is.Prior to the invasion of Iraq and Syria in 2014 by the Islamic State, also known as IS, most of the world's Yazidi population called the Sinjar mountain region their home.Thousands of members of the religious minority were abducted in Iraq in 2014.
The hundreds who have so far escaped captivity have ended up living in dire conditions with impoverished relatives or at camps, according to Amnesty.

HRC [Hillary Rodham Clinton] approved,"" wrote longtime Clinton aide Reines, referring to the State Department's approval of Clinton's tweet. 
On that same day on 11:35 p.m., after her decision to post on Twitter ""was cleared with State,"" Clinton wrote, ""I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible.""Of the total of 62,320 emails sent and received by Clinton on her private server(s) between March 2009 and February 2013 -- 30,490 were considered work-related and provided to the State Department while the remaining 31,830 were deemed private and allegedly destroyed.Meanwhile, no one yet knows the contents of the 31,830 so-called private-emails that Clinton and her team claim to have destroyed.I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible.-- Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 5, 2015In accordance with The Federal Records Act, the State Department allowed Clinton to determine which emails are and are not federal record, allowing her to decide which emails to surrender to the federal authorities and which ones to keep or destroy.U.S. State Department officials and the FBI just took Clinton's word about the destroyed emails being of no importance.Clinton may have been able to dispose of emails that could have incriminated her, while she played the card of the concern citizen willing to do the right thing.""In doing so, she has sought to support the State Department's efforts, fulfill her responsibility of record-keeping, and provide the chance for the public to assess the work she and officials at the State Department did during her tenure,"" claimed Hillary for America PAC, referring to Clinton's decision to highlight the email scandal on Twitter at the time. 
Wikileaks does not cover the content of the conversation between the Clinton campaign and the State Department.During the House Select Committee on Benghazi hearing last October, Clinton argued she emailed other State employees on their official government account, adding that at least 90 percent of her communications must have been logged into the State Department's federal record system before she ever submitted the emails.Since Clinton used her own personal server and email rather than an official government account, circumventing the requirement that the U.S. government maintain copies of the communications of federal employees, it would be difficult for the Obama administration to produce all, if any emails linked to the former Secretary of State, without her help.Although Clinton claims that she did email her fellow State employees on their official government account and that at least 90 percent of her communications are logged into the federal record system, then why did she submit thousands of emails to the U.S. State Department ""to review them for release.""When the U.S. State Department was asked about her claim, spokesman Mark Toner said, ""I'm not aware that we have given that figure.""""The [State Department] Inspector General Report found that less than one percent, less than one percent of State Department emails, record emails were captured,"" added Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC), chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi hearing last October when Clinton was grilled for hours. ""So they give a number of less than one percent, and you give a number of 90 percent.""I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible.

27	http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/12/book-excerpt-beyond-words-trumps-actions-speak/	Book Excerpt: Beyond Words, Judge Donald Trump by His Actions	"One issue that many wonder about is [Donald Trump's] apparent lack of empathy.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe public spotlight has shone for decades upon his business career and his place in the entertainment world, which is why we often miss the empathetic side of him that many doubt exists. Remember that he spent seven years remorselessly firing people on a television program, and this ""reality television"" show largely imprinted the image that we regard today as the real Donald Trump.But it was also Donald Trump who took Jennifer Hudson under his wing when her mother, brother, and nephew were gunned down in Chicago, offering her a free apartment at Trump Tower while she grieved. She was never charged for her stay and was able to feel safe.In 1988, Trump helped 3-year-old Andrew Ten, a boy who needed to fly to New York for special medical attention. The airline refused to let him board the plane because of his bulky medical equipment. Trump was informed of the issue and immediately sent his private jet to take the boy to New York.In 1986, a woman named Annabell Hill was in danger of losing her family farm. Her husband had committed suicide in the misguided hope that his life insurance policy settlement would make their farm solvent. Trump heard about this woman's plight and offered enough financial help to make sure she could keep her farm, which had been in the Hill family for three generations.After being arrested at the Mexican border with weapons in his car in 2013, Marine vet Andrew Tahmooressi spent seven months in a Mexican prison, where he was beaten and chained to a bed. When he was released, Trump sent him a check for $25,000 to help get him back on his feet.Darnell Barton was driving his bus across a bridge when he spotted a woman preparing to jump. He stopped the bus, approached the woman, and convinced her not to take her own life that day. When Trump heard about the story, he sent Barton $10,000, commenting, ""I thought that was so beautiful to see. I think he is a great guy with an amazing heart and I said that man should be rewarded.""Contrary to popular media belief, Donald Trump actually has a long history of helping others, as evidenced by Ivanka Trump in her RNC speech:Over the years, on too many occasions to count, I saw my father tear stories out of the newspaper about people whom he had never met, who were facing some injustice or hardship. He'd write a note to his assistant, in a signature black felt tip pen, and request that the person be found and invited to Trump Tower to meet with him. He would talk to them and then draw upon his extensive network to find them a job or get them a break. And they would leave his office, as people so often do after having been with Donald Trump, feeling that life could be great again.Because of Trump's innate generosity and empathy, he will likely listen to all Americans, not just his base (he has already begun to do so) and make intelligent decisions--though the bluntness and forcefulness of his speech may lead some to believe otherwise. Time and again, Trump has displayed his innate generosity. His expressions of empathy, particularly those expressed through financial gifts, seem unusually generous when compared to those of most national public office holders. And, lest you think it is because congressional members are not wealthy, remember that the Washington Post educated us on the matter in October of 2012:Most members weathered the financial crisis better than the average American, who saw median household net worth drop 39 percent from 2007 to 2010. The median estimated wealth of members of the current Congress rose 5 percent during the same period, according to their reported assets and liabilities. The wealthiest one-third of Congress gained 14 percent.Whether he is helping families in need or recognizing small acts of heroism or kindness, it's clear that Donald listened and lives in accordance with the idea that ""to whom much is given, much will be required."" In the same way, he will likely listen to Americans and make intelligent decisions--though the bluntness and forcefulness of his persona may lead some to believe otherwise.To some many of Trump's unique personality traits may make him seem ""un-presidential,"" but he's the best person for the job in our rapidly changing world. In fact, there have been many candidates in the past who could have learned a thing or two from Trump's straightforward, unrehearsed approach.Editor's Note: This is an excerpt from the new book ""Planes, Steak & Water: Defending Donald J. Trump"" by Autry J. Pruitt.Over the years, on too many occasions to count, I saw my father tear stories out of the newspaper about people whom he had never met, who were facing some injustice or hardship.
