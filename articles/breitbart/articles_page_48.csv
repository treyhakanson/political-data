Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson has four percent, while Green Party candidate Jill Stein has two percent.Trump leads Clinton on having the knowledge to create jobs and change the way Washington does business, and Hillary Clinton leads on possessing the right temperament to be president and being a good role model for children. However, Trump leads Clinton on trustworthiness -- 43 percent to 37 percent.When asked whether voters believe that the election results will be fair, 66 percent appeared confident that their votes would be counted accurately, while 31 percent of voters were skeptical. Two percent were unsure.Although the media raised the alarm after Trump's statement that he would ""keep people in suspense"" when asked if he would accept the results of the election, a majority of voters in the state do not feel the same way.Fifty-two percent of Florida voters said the statement did not bother them at all, while 36 percent said it bothered them a lot. Eleven percent said it bothered them ""a little,"" and one percent was not sure.Surprisingly, Florida voters overwhelmingly supported President Obama's recent actions to open up relations with Cuba. Sixty-seven percent approved of the actions, and only 22 percent disapproved. Eleven percent were not sure.Sen. Marco Rubio appears to be handily leading his Democratic opponent Rep. Patrick Murphy for Senate, holding a ten-point lead. Rubio has 51 percent support to Murphy's 41 percent.The poll was conducted October 21-24 by Selzer & Co, based on interviews with 953 Florida residents, who say they will definitely vote or have already voted in the 2016 general election. (An oversample of 148 likely voters identified as Hispanic on the Florida registered voter list was conducted, leading to a total of 212 likely Hispanic voters.)SIGN UP"

According to the research of John Galbraith Simmons, of the top twenty scientists in history, fifteen were religious believers, two were agnostic, and three were atheists.Sir Isaac Newton, for instance, whom Simmons considers to be the most important scientist who ever lived, was aided greatly in his scientific endeavors by his belief in an ordered, intelligible universe created by a God of order.Thus Newton could write: ""It is the perfection of God's works that they are all done with the greatest simplicity. He is the God of order and not of confusion."" Newton saw no incompatibility between his Christian faith and the purity of his science, but rather believed that they complemented one another. ""In the absence of any other proof, the thumb alone would convince me of God's existence,"" he wrote.The French scientist Louis Pasteur, founder of modern medicine and number five on Simmons's list, was a devout Catholic Christian as well as the developer of the germ theory of disease and the process of ""pasteurization."" He was able to wed an endearing humility and rich religious faith to scientific genius. ""I have the faith of a Breton peasant,"" he said later in life, ""and by the time I die I hope to have the faith of a Breton peasant's wife.""For some, in fact, every scientific discovery leads humanity to a deeper understanding of God, rather than to doubting his existence.Joseph H. Taylor Jr., Nobel Prize winner in Physics in 1993, wrote: ""A scientific discovery is also a religious discovery. There is no conflict between science and religion. Our knowledge of God is made larger with every discovery we make about the world.""If this is true, then Lindeman and Svedholm-Hakkinen may end up leading the world to a better understanding of its Creator, in spite of themselves.Follow Thomas D.

7	http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/26/war-women-campaign-replay/	Whether It’s John McCain, Mitt Romney or Donald Trump, Democrats Always Run ‘War on Women’ Campaign	"Single women are a crucial element of the Democrat constituency, pushed to the polls with a crude combination of scare tactics and pandering that would be comical if it wasn't so effective in election after election.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERWe may pause to remark that Republicans should have been much more prepared for this in 2016, but we should also look back to 2012 because it was used in 2012, regardless of how absurd it was to suggest Mitt Romney was leading a ""War on Women.""Even some liberals are recognizing the absurdity, given the emergence of ""Strange New Respect"" for Romney this year. Of course this new respect is pure political opportunism -- and don't be surprised to hear liberals complaining in future election that the conservative Republican presidential candidate isn't as candid and relaxed about social issues as Donald Trump was in the good old days of 2016.We should practice a little political opportunism of our own, and put the Left's revised opinion of Romney to good use. What they said about him was absurd in almost every respect. They've wholeheartedly embraced his position on the geopolitical threat of Russia, which means they're tacitly admitting Barack Obama didn't know what the hell he was talking about. They razz Trump about not paying enough taxes, but they didn't care a whit that Romney paid stupendous amounts of tax, plus vast charitable contributions.Most pertinently, they turned Mitt Romney into a misogynist clod, and his wife Ann Romney into an out-of-touch Stepford Wife, on the thinnest of pretexts. Lefty polemicists today are acting like they were possessed by political demons when they spent the final weeks of the 2012 campaign shrieking about ""binders full of women,"" and now they can't quite remember what they were going on about.As for Mrs. Romney, she was unceremoniously stripped of her feminine identity by liberals and treated like a space alien because she dared to endorse stay-at-home motherhood. When a mild backlash ensued, the White House memorably denied one of its slander ninja by claiming to know several different people with the same name.In the Democrat imagination and campaign ads, Republicans are constantly targeting American woman. You can draw a straight line from Anita Hill's hit on Clarence Thomas in the Nineties, to ""journalist"" George Stephanopoulos ambushing the Republican presidential field with a bizarre question about contraceptives in the 2012 primary.It's all pure opportunism, not principle. Romney was a choirboy, so they claimed his policies revealed his secret inner misogynist beast. Trump's policies include a family-leave plan, a culture-war cease-fire declared by Peter Thiel at the GOP convention, and an unease with late-term abortion that tracks with the majority of the country. There's precious little that could be twisted into a War on Women narrative, even by the people who used Sandra Fluke to portray spending ten bucks on contraceptives as the equivalent of female slavery. Therefore, the Left ignores Trump's policies and hits his character, while Bill Freakin' Clinton gets ready to move back into the White House.In the Nineties, Democrats argued that Clinton's sexual abuses had nothing to do with how he governed, so discussing them was a silly distraction we all needed to MoveOn.org from, even when he was in the dock for perjury. Liberals of that election cycle laughed out loud at the notion Bill Clinton's libido had any effect whatsoever on national policy. He was good for the abortion industry, so his treatment of actual women was irrelevant.Partisan feminism is at a strange crossroads, as the core feminist message of independence clashes with victim politics. Women are supposed to simultaneously feel strong, capable... and be utterly helpless before systemic male chauvinism. They can only achieve personal ""independence"" through total dependence on the Big Government, which is staffed and managed by the only men in America who supposedly aren't looking to exploit them. (You're not to think about the bureaucrats who keep getting caught surfing for pornography on government computers.)The great left-wing project to rewire society in defiance of biology has saddled America with devastating social problems, but that's not a problem for the social engineers. Indeed, it's more of a feature than a bug.Everything from illegitimacy, to crime, to the enormous difficulty of raising children as a single mom becomes another opportunity for them to push increased government power on a fearful, atomized population, which is rapidly losing its ability to form non-government voluntary structures of enduring social value, such as thriving small businesses and stable marriages.The dirty little secret known to the Left all along, but denied vociferously by them until their plans were fully up and running, is that most of these societal changes hit women harder, due to everything from their voluntary career choices, to the realities of child-rearing.So in the world liberals have made, single women become more anxious than ever, about everything from campus rape to the ""implicit bias"" of a systematically misogynist workplace, and they rush to government for protection from the harms caused by that abusive government.SIGN UP"

""They must be scared... they are also probably preparing to escape the city.""Residents and military officials said many IS fighters had relocated from eastern Mosul to their traditional bastions on the western bank of the Tigris river, closer to escape routes to Syria.The sounds of fighting on the northern and eastern fronts of the Mosul offensive could now be heard inside the city, residents said, and US-led coalition aircraft were flying lower over the city than usual.Tens of thousands of Iraqi fighters have been advancing on Mosul from the south, east and north after an offensive was launched on October 17 to retake the last major Iraqi city under IS control.The assault is being backed with air and ground support from the US-led coalition which launched its campaign against IS two years ago, shortly after the jihadists seized control of large parts of Iraq and Syria.- 'Wave of displaced' -Iraqi federal forces, allied with Kurdish peshmerga fighters, have taken a string of towns and villages in a cautious but steady advance over the last week in the face of shelling, sniper fire and suicide car bombings.Some 3,000 to 5,000 IS fighters are believed to be inside Mosul, Iraq's second city, alongside more than a million trapped civilians.Aid workers have warned of a major potential humanitarian crisis once fighting begins inside the city itself.An Iraqi minister said Wednesday that more than 3,300 civilians fleeing the fighting had sought help from the government the day before, the most for a single day so far.There was ""a big wave of displaced people that is considered the greatest number since the start of the military operation to liberate Nineveh province,"" Displacement and Migration Minister Jassem Mohammed al-Jaff said in a statement.Numbers of displaced residents were growing but stood at a relatively low 8,940 on Wednesday, according to a UN tally, because most of the fighting so far has taken place in sparsely populated areas.Civilians in villages on the eastern outskirts of Mosul were being bused to a camp near Khazir, an AFP correspondent reported.""The army made us get out, they told us to leave and said we would see about the details of our settlement"" in a camp, said Umm Ali, a 35-year-old woman.""We used to live in terror night and day, the shelling was coming closer. The Islamic State controlled our lives, so we decided to flee,"" said Essam Saadou, a 22-year-old student.A wave of displaced residents was also expected Wednesday from Al-Shura, an IS stronghold between Mosul and Qayyarah, the main staging base on the southern front, federal police said.- Sights set on Raqa -As the noose tightened on Mosul, 13 defence chiefs from the 60-nation coalition meeting in Paris set their sights on Syria's Raqa, which would be the last major city under IS control if it loses Mosul.""We have already begun laying the groundwork for our partners to commence the isolation of Raqa,"" US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter said after the talks.The coalition -- which also includes Britain and France -- has provided support in the form of thousands of air strikes, training for Iraqi forces and advisers on the ground.France said Wednesday it had extended the mission of its aircraft carrier, the Charles de Gaulle, in the eastern Mediterranean until at least mid-December to help the offensive on Mosul.President Francois Hollande decided to extend the mission after France's defence council ""reviewed the military, humanitarian, political and security stakes involved in the recapture of Mosul,"" a statement issued by his office said.Leaders in Paris on Tuesday also discussed the post-IS future of Mosul, which is an ethnically and religiously mixed region and where achieving a political compromise might prove even harder than a military victory.SIGN UP"

Global Warming Creating ‘Vast Deserts’	"In what may be a new record in climate change hyperbole, an article in Esquire magazine Tuesday declares that man-made global warming is creating ""vast deserts"" out of once verdant lands, even as we speak.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERStarting from the typical ""conservatives-hate-science"" leitmotiv, writer Charles S. Pierce goes on to make a series of ridiculously unscientific claims based on historical ignorance and bad math.Climate change, Pierce asserts, ""is piling up an impressive record of destroying the lives of many species, including our own."" One wonders: if climate change is on record as having destroyed the life of the human species, why wasn't anyone told? Which scientific journal documented the destruction of the human race?To back up his claim, Pierce notes that in various parts of the world, such as Madagascar, people are experiencing droughts and severe hunger, while failing to mention that famines have been going on literally for all of human history, even without the benefits of global warming.Pierce also cites a New York Times article about China's expanding deserts, which in turn cites ""one recent estimate"" that China's deserts have grown by 21,000 square miles in the last 40 years (since 1975), and that the expansion may have been ""accelerated"" by climate change.If this estimate is anywhere near correct, it suggests that the rate of expansion of China's deserts has actually slowed dramatically since 1975. The New York Times admits that for many years, China's deserts ""spread at an annual rate of more than 1,300 square miles."" If they had been increasing at 1,300 square miles a year since 1975, desert land would have grown by 53,300 square miles--more than double the quoted estimate.Moreover, later in the article, one reads that ""generations of families have made a living herding animals on the edge of the desert"" and that ""overgrazing is contributing to the desert's growth.""So, if one takes the New York Times at its word, China's deserts are growing far more slowly than in earlier decades, and much of that growth is due to ""overgrazing.""By any measure, that has nothing to do with global warming creating ""vast deserts.""Unwilling to let the facts get in his way, Pierce goes on to predict that the American west will also be facing desertification--just like what happened in the 1930s, he says. Once again he fails to note that the massive droughts that produced the dust bowl had nothing whatsoever to do with global warming.""The next time it happens, it will happen in an era of profound ecological damage that by then may be irreversible,"" Pierce ominously prophesies.For a magazine devoted to combating the idea of ""the Great Climate Change Hoax,"" Esquire might want to look for a more convincing spokesperson next time.

It comes right at the bottom.More than three times as many people care about education, and well over twice as many want better healthcare, job opportunities, and honest government than want ""action taken on climate change"".Only when the surveys are broken down between rich and poor countries does ""climate change"" creep higher up the list. But only in rich countries. In poor countries, as a ratio of the total number of votes made, it becomes even less of a concern.""Action on climate change"", in other words, is the decadent preoccupation of spoilt Westerners who have nothing serious to worry about because they have all the basics - education, healthcare, jobs, political freedoms, phone and internet access - more or less covered. The poll gives the lie to all those people - usual of a left-liberal persuasion - who insist that more needs to be done, more scarce resources diverted, to 'combat' climate change.If the money currently squandered by our governments on this non-problem - $1.5 trillion a year - reflected people's actual concerns (as governments are supposed to do), then the funding would dry up and a lot of worthless troughers would suddenly find themselves going very hungry.Which would be good for them, in a way, because for the first time in their miserable parasitical lives they might get a sense of the harm their policies are inflicting around the world - most especially on the poor who, more than anyone, need the cheap fossil fuel energy the greenies are determined to deny them.SIGN UP"

Especially when lingering in empty parking lots at 3:30 in the morning, holding black balloons. But are they scarier than real threats, like climate change, economic hardship, or the death of loved ones?According to Americans, yes. Yes, they are.I'd disagree. The results of the poll suggests that Americans have a generally sensible perspective on what constitutes a genuine threat to their wellbeing - top of the list, even higher than a terrorist attack, is corrupt government (61 per cent).Also, it accords well with a far more important global survey - so important it deserves a separate article which you can read here - showing just how low a priority climate change is for most people in the world.Essentially climate change has become a luxury problem which only liberals in rich countries can afford to worry about. For everyone else, there are many, many more pressing concerns...

Let me make my point and then I will give you the floor. What I said is, IF Trump is a sexual predator then that's a big story.

My point to you is, as a media story, we don't get to say that the ten women are lying. We have to cover that story, sir.NEWT: Sure. Okay, so it's worth 23 minutes of the three networks to cover that story, and Hillary Clinton in a speech in Brazil...saying her dream is an open border where 600 million people could come to America.

And I think the American voters would like to know-NEWT: Ok, and therefore we're going to send Bill Clinton back to the East Wing, because after all you are worried about sexual predators.MEGYN: Yeah, listen, it's not about me, it's about the women and men of America. And the poll numbers show us that the women of America in particular are very concerned about these allegations and in large part believe that they ARE a real issue. Don't dismiss the women summarily!NEWT: Do you want to comment on whether the Clinton ticket has a relationship to a sexual predator?MEGYN: We on the Kelly File have covered that story as well, sir.NEWT: No I want to actually hear you use the words.

USAID's Afghanistan mission has spent at least $17 billion on its efforts since the war started.Smith noted that the $791 million in fresh assistance is part of a multi-year pledge that the Obama administration made at the recent Afghanistan donor's conference in Brussels, where the United States highlighted its enduring commitment to Afghanistan.According to his prepared remarks, SIGAR Sopko told the Syracuse University Institute for National Security and Counterterrorism last Thursday:The U.S. government must better assess how much foreign assistance the host country can reasonably absorb without completely distorting the economy and improve our own ability to oversee and monitor that assistance. Imagine pouring water on a sponge. At some point the sponge becomes full and the water spills off to the side. In terms of foreign assistance, amounts provided that are more than 15 to 45% of a country's annual GDP [Gross Domestic Product] is generally considered counterproductive. On multiple occasions, U.S. assistance alone equaled Afghanistan's annual GDP, so more than double the high end of the recommendation, and was over the high end of 45% every year from 2004-2013. Combined with poor oversight and contracting practices, this was a recipe for disaster...The single most important thing the government needs to do is prioritize anti-corruption efforts - Congress needs to insist on it and hold the executive branch accountable for it; every agency involved in reconstruction must think about anti-corruption in every action they take and program they fund; and the National Security Council needs to ensure it stays a major political priority.Last month, SIGAR reported that the Obama administration has turned a blind eye to the ongoing corruption in Afghanistan.""Corruption undermined the U.S. mission in Afghanistan by fueling grievances against the Afghan government and channeling material support to the insurgency,"" acknowledged the inspector general in a 150-page report released in September, adding, ""U.S. money was flowing to the insurgency via corruption.""Despite the corruption evidence recently unveiled by SIGAR, the Afghan government is expected to receive ""$791 million in fresh aid... to support [USAID] programs that achieve Afghan-led, sustainable development,"" reports KP.""These agreements are a testament to the enduring partnership between the American and the Afghan people. Over the next 12-months, this funding will enable us to implement projects and deliver valued services to our citizens across Afghanistan,"" declared Afghanistan's finance minister during the ceremony Monday.""These are some of the first practical steps we are taking to deliver on our commitments and the pledges that were made at the Brussels Conference to help Afghanistan achieve self-reliance,"" Hakimi added.Meanwhile, USAID Director Smith underscored America's enduring commitment to the people of Afghanistan and its government.""This document reaffirms U.S. determination to support the government of Afghanistan in efforts to strengthen Afghanistan's institutions, maintain gains in education and health services achieved in recent years, and improve the welfare of the Afghan people,"" he said at the signing ceremony Monday.""The funds obligated under the agreements will support programs that achieve strategic development objectives, including a thriving economy led by the private sector, a democratic government with broad citizen participation, and a better educated and healthier Afghan population,"" reports KP.Hakimi vowed that Afghanistan would use the money as intended and spend it on education, health, as well as developing good governance and integrity over the next four years.The U.S. government must better assess how much foreign assistance the host country can reasonably absorb without completely distorting the economy and improve our own ability to oversee and monitor that assistance.

According to CNN, some soldiers are being billed $1,300 for restitution payments. As a bitter sign of military collector aggressiveness, soldiers are being hit with federal wage garnishments and tax liens.But following the Breitbart headline on October 23rd that went viral and generated over 600 comments, Representative John Garamendi [D-Walnut Grove] summed up Congressional bipartisan anger: ""I guess it's always the private that gets beat up.""Backed by both California's U.S. Senators and every Congressional member, Garamendi announced plans to submit an amendment to the 2017 Defense Department budget that will prohibit the Pentagon from spending any money to reclaim what is believed to be more than $100 million of improper payments doled out between 2005 and 2010 by corrupt military recruiters to veterans across the nation.California lawmakers also intend to submit legislation that would prevent the Army from ever repeating such a ""claw-back"" against future unsuspecting soldiers.The Obama administration has stated that over 1,200 Army recruiters and 2,000 Recruiter Assistants are suspected of fraudulently granting 106,364 unqualified RAP payments to individuals. More than 200 officers are under investigation for knowledge of illegal RAP payments, including two generals and dozens of colonels.Director of the Army Lt. Gen. William Grisoli, told Stars & Stripes newspaper that investigators believe that 104 criminal cases of recruiter incentive fraud have been adjudicated, and 16 people have been imprisoned, including five National Guard recruiter assistants who each collected over $1 million in fraudulent bonuses.The worst offender appears to be California National Guard's incentives manager Army Master Sgt. Toni Jaffe. After admitting that, from the fall of 2007 through October 2009, she ""routinely submitted false and fictitious claims on behalf of her fellow California National Guard members,"" amounting to $15.2, she pled guilty to making ""false claims against the United States."" Jaffe served to 30 months in a federal prison. Three California Guard officers also have pleaded guilty to criminal fraud and agreed to pay restitution.U.S. House of Representatives Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy circulated a letter to stop the collection efforts that was signed by 23 of his Californian colleagues. He told Fox News: ""It is disgraceful & unacceptable that veterans are being told to pay back their bonuses."" He added, ""This is no way to treat those who have fulfilled their commitments to their country. They should be held harmless in light of the fraud that was perpetrated on them by overzealous recruiters.""The California National Guard spokesman told The Sacramento Bee that they do not have the authority to waive the debts on their own but would ""welcome a law that would forgive the improper bonuses.""California's two senators and House members from both parties are trying to block the Pentagon from recovering tens of millions of dollars worth of illegal retention and re-enlistment bonuses it awarded to California National Guard soldiers during the height of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.The Sacramento Bee first reported on widespread abuse of incentives in the California National Guard retention office in 2010. Retired Master Sgt. Toni Jaffe in 2012 was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison and required to repay $15.2 million after pleading guilty to fraud. Several other officers also later pleaded guilty to misusing the funds.In most cases, soldiers did not know they were not entitled to the benefits. The Army now is demanding that they repay retention and re-enlistment bonuses that tended to range from $15,000 to $20,000 per soldier, a recovery program that The Bee described in 2013.The bottom line is this: our veterans should not pay the price for failures in accounting and oversight by the bureaucracy.-- John Garamendi (@RepGaramendi) October 24, 2016In the past four years, the Army has collected $22 million from soldiers who should not have received retention or re-enlistment bonuses. In many cases, those recovery efforts distressed veterans trying to move on with their lives after wartime deployments.""We have been vilified, like we have done something wrong and must be punished,"" former Staff Sgt. Troy Torres of Galt told The Bee in 2013 when the National Guard demanded that he repay a $20,000 grant for education expenses.The bottom line is this: our veterans should not pay the price for failures in accounting and oversight by the bureaucracy.

The move by the federal government comes just two weeks before Arpaio stands before the voters of Maricopa County for re-election to his seventh term.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBreitbart Texas' Lana Shadwick reported on October 11, that prosecutors for the Department of Justice were preparing charges for his allegedly violations of a court order on racial profiling. At that time, Judge Susan Bolton asked the prosecutors to write a ""show cause order"" for her to sign.Arpaio claimed the charges by the Obama Justice Department are politically motivated in an ad last week, Fox News reported on Tuesday evening. Arpaio's lawyer, Mel McDonald told Fox News he believes ""that when the final chapter is written, he (Arpaio) will be vindicated.""Breitbart Texas reported:Arpaio was sued by the ACLU, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), and a law firm that Eric H. Holder, Jr. works for. Holder was a partner at the firm for six years prior to his appointment as U.S. Attorney General, and Holder returned to the firm after he left his post as Attorney General. The law firm has been reported as ""a key player in the opposition to Arizona's anti-illegal immigration law.""Arpaio has criticized Holder for among other things, how he handled Operation Fast and Furious, and for not being a supporter of peace officers. Holder was held in contempt of Congress in June 2012 over the ATF's Fast and Furious gun-running scandal. There were 255 House members who voted to hold the sitting Attorney General in contempt, including 17 Democrats. Holder and the DOJ would not comply with an October 2011 subpoena to turn over thousands of documents related to Operation Fast and Furious. Breitbart Texas has reported extensively about Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry who was slain in Arizona while on patrol. Two of the guns involved in the ambush were eventually tied to the Fast and Furious operation. After two officers were shot execution-style in New York, Arpaio criticized New York Mayor Bill De Blasio and Attorney General Eric Holder.Arpaio has long been a critic and nemesis of President Obama. In June 2014, Breitbart TV reported that Arpaio told NewsMax TV that he believes Obama intentionally caused the current crisis of thousands of unaccompanied minors flooding across the U.S.-Mexico border to force ""Congress to do something"" or ""shove some more executive orders down our throat.""AZCentral previously reported, ""Arpaio's charge stems from a December 2011 federal court order that barred his agency from enforcing federal immigration law. It is alleged that his deputies continued to do so, however, for at least 18 months thereafter.""Arpaio had previously acknowledged violating District Judge Murray Snow's previous order on the county enforcing federal immigration law but said he did so unintentionally, Fox News stated. The judge disagreed and said he did so to help his re-election chances.The charge is a misdemeanor that could land the 84-year-old sheriff in jail for up to six months if he is convicted. The misdemeanor would not stop the seven-term sheriff from continuing to serve as Maricopa County's sheriff.Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

There were 255 House members who voted to hold the sitting Attorney General in contempt, including 17 Democrats. Holder and the DOJ would not comply with an October 2011 subpoena to turn over thousands of documents related to Operation Fast and Furious. Breitbart Texas has reported extensively about Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry who was slain in Arizona while on patrol. Two of the guns involved in the ambush were eventually tied to the Fast and Furious operation. After two officers were shot execution-style in New York, Arpaio criticized New York Mayor Bill De Blasio and Attorney General Eric Holder.
Arpaio has long been a critic and nemesis of President Obama. In June 2014, Breitbart TV reported that Arpaio told NewsMax TV that he believes Obama intentionally caused the current crisis of thousands of unaccompanied minors flooding across the U.S.-Mexico border to force ""Congress to do something"" or ""shove some more executive orders down our throat.""var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([""embed""]);SIGN UP"

Walker Governor's School for Government and International Studies (MLWGS) are launching a ""Planned Parenthood Club,"" according to a recent Facebook post.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe public school for advanced students - located in the Richmond, Virginia area - was ranked in 2014 by Newsweek/The Daily Beast as the ""12th best public high school,"" states the school on its website.According to the post:Maggie Walker's new club ""Planned Parenthood Generation Action"" is holding its first meeting on Monday, September 19th in room 206. Whether you are interested in health, education, or getting community service hours this election season this club is for you.While the Planned Parenthood ""club"" does not appear on the school's list of clubs and activities, the website notes the list provided is ""not an exhaustive list.""According to the school's ""Club Constitution & By-Laws,"" the Planned Parenthood club's faculty sponsor is Dr. Janet Spencer, and the purpose of the club is ""to provide education, outreach, and advocacy opportunities at Maggie Walker to support the goals of Planned Parenthood,"" to ""create a network with other students who support Planned Parenthood,"" and to ""engage in the political process to win elections and pass pro reproductive freedom legislation.""Regarding its ""clubs and activities,"" MLWGS states its students are ""involved in an amazing number and variety of clubs. The school has a single lunch period, which facilitates club meetings and events with guest speakers.""""Many clubs and activities will have a community service component, including all honor societies,"" notes the school's website.As Live Action News reports, the school's news site - called MLWGS Jabberwock - observed in September that Planned Parenthood Generation Action chapters are usually launched only on college campuses, but that ""this month the Maggie Walker community will welcome its very own chapter to the school thanks to Kiera Goddu ('17), Amanda Mier ('17), and Naomi Vickers ('17).""Jabberwock continues:Goddu, Mier, and Vickers are more than enthused to bring a new experience to the student body of Maggie Walker. Goddu explained that Generation Action chapters operate by advocating for reproductive rights, keeping Planned Parenthood clinics open, offering a wide range of publicly available education services, and lobbying to remove targeted restrictions such as those imposed on abortion providers. Maggie Walker's Generation Action club plans to meet the goals of its founders and of the Planned Parenthood organization through three primary branches.Goddu is completing a mentorship at Planned Parenthood and says she hopes that the Planned Parenthood club can be an extension of her work into school. She is critical of her middle school, where she claims sex education had an emphasis on abstinence from sex.""They said that the only definition of abstinence was that it was abstaining from sex until marriage between a man and a woman,"" she said. ""And I was like -- abstinence can be applied to many things -- like abstaining from doing basically anything!""Mier says the school's new Planned Parenthood club will provide ""inclusive sex education that's not just about...what's between a man and a woman, but also is LGBTQ inclusive...""Vickers explains that ""choice"" is a primary talking point of the Planned Parenthood club's education program.""A choice in any type of good society should be...the choice to abort if she wants to or [the woman] should have the choice to have the child if she wants to and feel like the government places enough value on the life of all people that they will support her and her child in every way possible,"" she said. ""That is a choice, and that's what I want people to know.""The Jabberwock notes that Vickers views a lack of reproductive justice in the black community as a critical issue for her as well.""It's really about justice for all people and what they need and deserve,"" she said.According to Planned Parenthood, Planned Parenthood Generation Action is a network of young community organizers who ""mobilize advocates for reproductive freedom"" and ""raise public awareness about reproductive health and rights.""Planned Parenthood leaders say that, as they have travelled the country meeting with their political Action Fund leaders during this election year, they discovered that what's most important to their Generation Action young people is ""abortion, sexuality, and sex-positivity.""""For 2016 and beyond, these leaders will be driving the program that will result in real change for sexual and reproductive health, rights, and freedom,"" Planned Parenthood says. ""That will change the nature of power in this country.""Planned Parenthood is the nation's largest provider of abortions. The group receives more than a half billion dollars of taxpayer funds each year and performs over 300,000 abortions annually as well.For over a year, Planned Parenthood has been under congressional investigation stemming from allegations that it illegally sells the body parts of aborted babies for a profit.We must defund @PPact #100yearsofabuse https://t.co/zg9ng1Vkty pic.twitter.com/QpBEBPaaZ6-- Students for Life (@Students4LifeHQ) October 17, 2016""I think Planned Parenthood has been spending too much time trying to copy the Pro-Life Generation with their not-so-subtle messaging of the 'Planned Parenthood Generation' and now their entrance into the realm of high school clubs,"" Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, tells Breitbart News. ""They boast 200 college groups while Students for Life of America passed the 1,000 group mark for high school and college pro-life groups earlier this year.""Hawkins explains Planned Parenthood's drive to appeal to more young people in the country.""Planned Parenthood is desperately seeking new clients so they are relying on their predatory business model of getting young women to trust them for their faulty birth control, and then when they get pregnant, to get abortions at Planned Parenthood,"" Hawkins adds. ""High schoolers are smarter than that and we've been educating them for years already about Planned Parenthood's sleazy business plans.""""Honestly, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but good luck, Planned Parenthood,"" Hawkins says. ""This is a pro-life generation, not the Planned Parenthood generation.""Breitbart News reached out for comment to Maggie Walker but received no immediate response prior to publication.Maggie Walker's new club ""Planned Parenthood Generation Action"" is holding its first meeting on Monday, September 19th in room 206.

""Early voting in Florida is underway so make sure you get out and vote. We have a thing going on that they have never seen before. It is a movement. They have never seen anything like it before. We are going to win and we are going to bring back a lot of good things including common sense to the White House.""Trump, wearing a camoflauge ""Make America Great Again"" ballcap, made his usual stump speech, which included the usual pledges on job creation, a border wall, health care and trade.""We have the power in our hands,"" he said. ""In just 14 days - 14 days? Can you believe this? I started, it was a year and a half. now we're down to 14 days. We had unbelievably tough, nasty primaries. We're proud to say they were the most difficult and toughest primaries  they say in the history of politics. And now we have a nasty, nasty election. But we have the facts on our side. We're going to bring back jobs. We're going to get rid of ObamaCare.""Big crowd (and big skies) for Trump in Tallahassee pic.twitter.com/oAZMSsit5Y-- Nick Corasaniti (@NYTnickc) October 25, 2016One of the highlights of the event was Trump's response to Vice President Joe Biden, who in an interview with MSNBC's Chris Matthews earlier in the day said he would take Trump ""behind the gym.""""I'd love that,"" Trump said. ""I'd love that. Mr. Tough Guy -- you know, he's Mr. Tough Guy. You know when he's Mr. Tough Guy? When he's standing behind a microphone by himself,"" Trump said.""Some things in life you could really love doing,"" he added.Other diginitaries participating in the rally included Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and outgoing Rep. Jeff Miller (R-FL), who both made pitches for the GOP nominee.Attendance for the event might have been a bit higher, but thousands were turned away from the rally when the Leon County Sheriff Department blocked access.A Leon County sheriff deputy told the crowd they would not be let in to the event and said it was at the behest of the Trump campaign to not allow people entrance at a certain point in time before the rally. He described the campaign's event planning as ""almost admirable,"" but advised those waiting outside the venue to go find another place to watch it on TV.In the prior four presidential elections, Leon County, home of Tallahassee, has gone for the Democratic candidate and had historically elected more Democrats to office than most of the counties in northern Florida. Outside of the event, there were a handful of anti-Trump protesters.
On the day of Trump's visit to Florida's capital city, the Tallahassee Democrat, the city's local newspaper, featured an editorial on the paper's front page urging to talk about the ""nobility of journalism"" and to ""show humility.""For many in this decidedly left-leaning town, what comes to mind is not very flattering. For others in the decidedly right-leaning counties surrounding Leon, your arrival will be hailed as heaven-sent.We have some things to say and we hope you will follow the lead of Winston Churchill, who said:""Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen.""We want to talk to you about the nobility of both journalism and humility.On Wednesday, after a stop in Washington, D.C., Trump hits the campaign trail with two stops in North Carolina.Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poorBig crowd (and big skies) for Trump in Tallahassee pic.twitter.com/oAZMSsit5Y

Police first claimed that perhaps as many as 50 attackers were involved, but now the number has been increased to over 150.Also, earlier reports noted one or two victims of the attackers, but now that number includes at least six students and one police officer.Temple University officials scrambled on Friday to send out warnings to students and staffers on campus to stay indoors while the mobs careened through the area.TU Alert: Increased police activity due to large groups of juveniles along Broad Street on/near Main Campus. Police responding. Avoid area.-- Temple University (@TempleUniv) October 22, 2016It now appears that the mob of mostly black teens had arranged the attacks using Instagram, the Philadelphia Inquirer noted.In one attack, the father of victim Christina Laulette reported that his daughter was beaten bloody by up to 40 youths who swarmed around her and her two male companions. All were viciously beaten without provocation. ""Her and her 2 male friends where badly beaten by a group of 30-40 black teenagers on their way home from the Temple football game,"" Joe Lauletta wrote in a Facebook post.The aggrieved father reported that his daughter was ""kicked and stomped"" and ""Every part of her body is badly bruised.""The attacks were similar to the ""knockout game,"" in which urban youths sucker punch passersby.In addition, the mobs lashed out at two police officers and one teen even punched a police horse in the muzzle several times.Some surveillance video shows a large group of teens running rampant.Appearing on a New Jersey radio station, former Temple student Ashley Hall told 101.5 FM host Bill Spadea that in the past Temple University prided itself on its campus safety campaign.On Tuesday evening, the president of Temple University posted a brief description of the attacks.On Friday night we sent a TU Alert that reported a large group of youths gathered as a result of a ""flash mob"" near the Pearl Theater, adjacent to Temple's Main Campus.

The crime scene was also compromised, with reporters and others freely walking around with no regard for forensic investigators. The creation of graffiti surrounding that office has continued.""The ATF's destruction of evidence in their investigation of Democrat terrorists tells us everything we need to know about our government,"" conservative activist and North Carolinian Noel Fritsch told Breitbart News.""The destruction of the 'Nazi Republicans go home or else' message is an attempt to cover up behavior of violent leftists bent on oppressing those with whom they disagree, and one wonders to what extent our federal government shares in that violent leftist agenda,"" Fritsch said.Here are the firsthand accounts of Orange County Republicans who spoke to Breitbart News, in their own words:Daniel Ashley, chairman of the Orange County Republican Party:""I stumbled onto our headquarters Sunday morning. My wife and I had gone to eat breakfast at a restaurant in town. I was showing her the work we had done, I wanted to use the restroom and she wanted a bottle of water so we went to headquarters,"" said Ashley, who noted that the worst thing they'd faced so far was stolen yard signs.""We saw the police tape,"" Ashley said. ""My wife took some pictures of the building, the window was busted up, I was trying to call some people and alert them. The police said, 'You've been more than vandalized. You've been torched.""Ashley dropped off his wife at home then returned to the scene of the attack.""They were working inside,"" Ashley said of ATF agents and police. ""Then they started painting over the 'Nazi Republicans leave town or else,' which was on an adjacent building next door. They started painting over that with black paint. I said, 'why are they painting over that right now?' After [ATF] finally let us in I said, 'why did you start painting over the graffiti?' I know it said Nazi republicans but i don't know what else it said. I asked four times. The ATF agents, they would look at each other; finally on the fourth time I got a real dirty look like 'who are you to be asking these questions?'""""These people thought this out,"" Ashley said of the attackers. ""This is domestic terrorism.""Michele Nix, vice chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party:It happened Sunday morning, and I was there Monday,"" Nix said.""When it happened the chairman of the Orange County Republian party, he could not get to the building because everything was taped off,"" Nix said. ""We saw the burned out shell of an office building...it was awful.""""When they threw the molotov cocktail they thought it would explode, but there was a couch there, and it lit the couch on fire.""""It was on the side of the building next to where they had firebombed the building,"" Nix said of the Nazi message. ""On the building next door they spray painted 'Nazi Republicans leave town or else.'""""When I got there, I saw that it had already been spray painted over, and I asked the ATF chairman and he said it was the ATF"" who spray-painted it over.""Why would they do that? The chairman said I don't know. I kept asking them but they wouldn't answer me.""""We couldn't understand why there wasn't any yellow tape that was up. They came in, they [ATF] examined everything but there was no crime scene tape. I told the Hillsborough county police, why was there no crime scene tape?
