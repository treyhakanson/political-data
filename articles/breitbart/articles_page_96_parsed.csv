Trump rolled out a new campaign theme highlighting his populist nationalism and contrasting that with Hillary Clinton's elitist globalism.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAngel Mom Michelle Root, whose daughter Sarah Root was killed by an illegal alien, joined Trump on stage in Council Bluffs, Iowa, to help paint the picture of what the world be like if Hillary Clinton were elected president.""I just wanted to say thank you everybody for turning out for Mr. Trump,"" she said. ""Hillary called me deplorable and irredeemable. She is not a friend to women, I just want to tell you that right now. The Obama-Clinton policies released the man that killed my daughter after he showed up at the borders. Then after he killed my daughter, they released him again. Now where is he? Nobody knows. Donald Trump is the only person that cared about us when no one else could and would. If Hillary wins, how many more girls are going to die? How many more women will die at the hands of their policies? Thank you, thank you Mr. Trump.""When Trump took the stage, he lit into Hillary Clinton with a stronger-than-ever line of attack focused on her deep corruption related to the Clinton Cash narrative--a narrative that Clinton and debate moderator Lester Holt conveniently avoided on Monday night--honing his new key phrase: ""Follow The Money.""""We are going to take on the special interests, the lobbyists, and the corrupt corporate media that have rigged the system against every single American,"" Donald Trump said on stage in Council Bluffs, Iowa.He continued:I've been reading stories over the last couple of days that are so inaccurate and so dishonest, I've never seen anything like it in my life and I'm willing to take it on because--and I didn't need it, believe me I didn't need it. I have a great company, I built this great company and somebody said 'you know he could be at a point where he's enjoying the fruits of his labor' and here I am working harder than ever before. I'm like a lot of people in the different rooms and different stadiums where 18 years ago their wages and real wages were higher than they are today. They had one job, now they have two jobs and they're working harder--much harder--and they're making much less money. That's what's happened in our country and the only thing I can say is I'm also working harder.WATCH TRUMP'S FULL SPEECH IN COUNCIL BLUFFS, IOWA:After noting he's spent tens of millions of dollars of his own money of his campaign, he says it's because ""we're not going to be controlled.""""We're not going to be controlled,"" Trump reiterated. ""We're not going to be controlled. We're going to take our country back and it's going to be a beautiful thing. This is a movement. We have a movement going on like I think they've never seen before.""From there, Trump noted that his vision for the country is a government that serves the people--not one that serves the politicians like the way the Clintons have used government to their own personal benefit.""We are going to create a new government that serves you, your family, and your country,"" Trump said. ""We're going to lower taxes by a lot, less regulation, more affordable childcare, fair trade deals, secure borders, thriving family farms--millions and millions of new jobs. We are going to end the Clinton Corruption--total corruption--""After Trump had to stop for nearly a full minute as the crowd of thousands chanted ""LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP!"" Trump continued by noting it's ""horrible, horrible what's happened to this country"" and that he, unlike Clinton will ""restore dignity and honesty to government service.""""Hillary Clinton is an insider fighting for her donors and her insiders,"" Trump said, but ""mostly fighting for herself. I am an outsider fighting for you. We're fighting together. We're fighting together.""From there, he launched his new campaign theme: ""Everything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple phrase: Follow The Money.""""Follow The Money,"" a reference back to investigators who look for motive in a certain wrongdoing by someone, is what several Trump aides tell Breitbart News going to be a huge new focus of the campaign. Trump is going to, since Monday night's debate at Hofstra University an hour away from here on Long Island leading up to the next debate in St. Louis, they say, highlight the contrast of how Hillary Clinton stands up for special interests so as to enrich herself while he stands up for ordinary American workers. The populist pitch has been common throughout his campaign, but aides say to expect a reinvigorated triple down version of it in the coming weeks. Trump is fighting for the everyman, while Clinton is fighting for herself, they say will be the message. And all of Clinton's actions to take the conversation off the economy and jobs and national security--and onto trivial personal squabbles that Trump has had over the years--play right into their hands: He's the serious candidate, they say, fighting for Americans and talking about real issues. While the dishonest mainstream media may believe Hillary Clinton won the debate because she landed a couple decent punches on Trump on nonsense issues, Trump spent the night and the days since showing he's concerned about Americans' economic prospects, their safety, their security and their families. And as such, he's expanding his chances electorally and is planning a western trip that will focus on several states he's doing well in so far--like Nevada and Arizona--as well states nobody in politics thought he had a chance in before like New Mexico and Colorado. Trump's succeeded, they believe, in Monday night's debate at one thing for sure: He connected to many Americans who feel like the system is broken and nobody cares...except for him.""In her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds,"" Trump continued in his Council Bluffs speech. ""She received $4.1 million in speaking fees from financial firms. I'd like to see what she said. Where are the papers? Bernie--Bernie was asking for the papers, but Bernie gave up.""As Trump was saying this, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders--who failed his bid to beat Clinton for the Democratic nomination thanks to a lopsided effort by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to tilt the scales in Clinton's favor, as evidenced by leaked emails published right before the Democratic National Convention--Clinton and a defeated and surrendered Sanders appeared together in New Hampshire.""The same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government,"" Trump continued: Twenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State. And don't forget the Clinton contributors were appointed to advisory boards by Secretary Clinton - and guess what? They wrote checks. The favors were granted and all of these people or at least a lot of them wrote checks. She even gave up 20 percent of Uranium--you know what happens with Uranium, don't you?--and who controls that 20 percent? Russia. Russia. Russia. She disgraced the office of Secretary of State by putting it up for sale -- and if she ever got the chance, she would put the Oval Office up for sale too and nobody has any doubt about it. We can't let that happen.Trump campaign sources tell Breitbart News to contrast what Trump laid out in Iowa--and later on Wednesday in Wisconsin--back to what he detailed in Melbourne, Florida, on Tuesday in an uplifting policy-focused speech. That combination, they say, will help paint a picture of someone who is fighting for American workers against what Trump says is the ""rigged political system."" The everyman warrior, if you will, is taking on all comers: The media, the politicians, the lobbyists, foreign influence agents, and anyone or anything else that represents a threat to America. In other words, it's Trump against the world.WATCH TRUMP'S FULL SPEECH IN WAUKESHA, WISCONSIN""Our country is filled with so many amazing people, people who lift us up and inspire us,"" Trump said at the Florida rally with thousands in attendance, before calling out to his friend former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani in the audience. He then contrasted Clinton's defense of the status quo with his specific policy plans that he's been laying out in detailed policy-laden speeches throughout the past several months, while Clinton has run a policy-free campaign.""Ours is truly a special country,"" Trump added a moment later: And we must never stop fighting to keep the American dream alive. Never. Never. Unfortunately now for too many Americans the American dream is now out of reach. It's not working. Our country isn't working. So many things are going wrong. Last night when I debated Secretary Clinton on America's future, for 90 minutes I watched her very carefully and I also was holding back--I didn't want to do anything to embarrass her--but I watched her and she was stuck in the past. For 90 minutes, on issue after issue, Hillary Clinton defended the terrible status quo while I laid out our plan--all of us together--to bring jobs, security and prosperity back to the American people. For 90 minutes she argued against change while I call for dramatic change. We have to have dramatic change. We have to get rid of Obamacare. We have to strengthen up our depleted military--it's in such bad shape--we're going to do a lot of great things folks.WATCH TRUMP'S FULL SPEECH IN MELBOURNE, FLORIDA:Trump detailed several polls that showed he won the debate, before he again laid out the contrasts with Clinton.""I watched last night, I found it so interesting--I knew I was going into a situation where you were going to have one of the largest audiences in the history of television and I took a deep breath and I pretended I was talking to my family, I just blocked it all out,"" Trump said. It's very interesting. And she was talking about what she was going to do to get rid of ISIS, what she was going to do on childcare, what she was going to do on all these different things. And I kept saying, for 26 years you've been doing nothing. Nothing. For 26 years, she's done nothing. When she ran for the Senate in New York, New York was having a big problem keeping jobs because her husband signed NAFTA and NAFTA was draining the jobs out of our country going to Mexico and other places but NAFTA was a disaster--probably the worst trade deal ever signed by anybody anywhere in the world. NAFTA was a disaster. She promised running for the Senate years ago 200,000 jobs for upstate New York. It was a disaster. Not only didn't they come, but they lost so many jobs--you have to see it now. It's so sad when you see what happened to upstate New York. It is a disaster. The companies have left and gone to Mexico and other places, the jobless situation is horrible and she said she was going to do something about it and the day after the election it was like 'bye-bye.' And that's exactly what would happen if she ever won.After walking rally goers through how ""we can't let that happen,"" because ""we know her too well,"" Trump called Clinton ""the candidate of yesterday.""""And ours is the campaign and we are the people of the future,"" Trump said, adding:Hillary Clinton defended every major failure that she helped to create. She defended the Iran deal, one of the worst deals ever. She defended her role in unleashing ISIS. She is responsible along with Barack Obama--they created a vacuum by getting out of Iraq which they should have never been in in the first place. And does everybody believe me, I was against going into Iraq. It was so well-documented, and Sean Hannity is now saying 'he was absolutely against it' and nobody wants to call him because nobody wants to hear that. But she defended the conditions of our inner cities where African American families are living in a situation where nobody should be forced to live in and what's happened is government led by Democrats should be ashamed of themselves.Trump then detailed how Clinton's ""only experience is at failure,"" and how she ""bragged"" about having ""traveled all over the world.""""It's true, she traveled all over the world,"" Trump said. ""And you know what it got us? It got us nothing. It got us debt and it got us death. We have death and debt. And unemployment. We have all bad things. And I said last night, I said 'You know, Secretary: You are experienced. But it's bad experience because everything you did turned out bad.'""
Trump, later in the speech, ""summed up"" his ""economic agenda"" in ""three beautiful words""-- ""jobs, jobs, jobs""--and then explained his positive change policy agenda:We will cut your taxes, and let you deduct the cost of childcare, it's about time. We will reduce regulations and create millions of new jobs for our country. We will unleash American energy adding trillions in new wealth for our workers. We are going to shrink our trade deficit and protect American manufacturing which is being led to slaughter--being led to slaughter. Florida has lost one in five manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. That's the economic legacy of Bill and Hillary Clinton, folks. The tax, trade, energy and regulatory reforms I propose will create at least 25 million new jobs over the next 10 years--and that will happen. Let me tell what else we're going to do: We're going to repeal and replace the horrible Obamacare. Clinton on the other hand wants to expand the Obamacare disaster and put the government completely in charge of America's healthcare. Two other major reforms I'm proposing are school choice and ending Common Core. We're going to end Common Core. I want every disadvantaged child in this country, including every poor Hispanic child in this country and every poor African American child in this country to be able to attend the public, private, magnet, or religious school of their choice. It's the great civil rights issue of our time.
I've been reading stories over the last couple of days that are so inaccurate and so dishonest, I've never seen anything like it in my life and I'm willing to take it on because--and I didn't need it, believe me I didn't need it. I have a great company, I built this great company and somebody said 'you know he could be at a point where he's enjoying the fruits of his labor' and here I am working harder than ever before. 
I'm like a lot of people in the different rooms and different stadiums where 18 years ago their wages and real wages were higher than they are today.

But he wants to be let go early so he can attend classes.According to Chicago's ABC affiliate, Masri sent his letter to a federal judge asking to be released to a halfway house only four years into his decade-long sentence.In the letter, the terrorist insists he is a model inmate and was ""never a bad person."" He added, ""I was stupid and delusion and I made bad choices.""Masri also said he has already been accepted as a student at the institution using an address in the suburb of Wheaton.The convicted terrorist also said he will turn his life around and try to help others. He told the judge he will ""work very hard to dissuade young Muslims from extremism, by using my experience."" He signed his letter ""yours truthfully.""ABC discovered an odd quirk in the federal rules for education aid.""As for government student aid, ex-cons from drug cases and sex crimes are not acceptable but apparently convicted terrorists are eligible for federal grants and loans,"" the report said.For its part, the Chicago college that accepted the terrorist said they won't discriminate against those applying for acceptance.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.SIGN UP"	['Warner']	[]

"Tina Houchins, a gold star mother in Ft. Lee, Va., asked President Barack Obama why he refused to identify terrorists as radical Islamic terrorists, during a town hall event with CNN.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERObama immediately dismissed her question, calling it a ""manufactured"" issue by his political opponents.He repeated his argument that radical organizations like al-Qaeda or ISIS had ""perverted and distorted"" Islam as an excuse for terrorism. ""There's no religious rationale that would justify in any way any of the things that they do,"" Obama said.Houchins' 19-year-old son Aaron Goteer was killed in Baghdad in 2007 by radical Islamic terrorists, but Obama explained that he was anxious to avoid offending Muslims around the world by lumping in violent terrorists with their religion.""When you start calling these organizations Islamic terrorists, the way it's heard, the way it's received by our friends and allies around the world is that somehow Islam is terroristic,"" he said. ""And that then makes them feel as if they're under attack.""To illustrate his position, Obama suggested that if a Christian started killing people in the name of Christianity, he would be upset.""If you had an organization that was going around killing and blowing people up and said we're on the vanguard of Christianity, well, as a Christian, I'm not going to let them claim my religion and say you're killing for Christ,"" he said.Obama warned Americans that rhetoric used by Republicans surrounding the Islamic religion was endangering the country, referring specifically to ""people aspiring to become president.""When CNN's Jake Tapper suggested that the president must have been referring to Donald Trump, he denied it.""No, I wasn't,"" he said, protesting that he didn't want to talk partisan politics on a military base.""It's not unique to the Republican nominee,"" he added.

David Vitter, who pressed for answers as Rodriguez tried to avoid providing any details, such as numbers, about the number of refugees who later launch terror plots.""Just to clarify your earlier statement, you touted nobody came in through the refugee program as an adult who committed a violent act,"" Vitter said during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. ""But there sure were those who came in, who were convicted of terror offenses,"" he said.""I was transparent about that. That's correct,"" Rodriguez insisted.Vitter responded; ""Have you personally reviewed all of those cases? Because as the Chair said, we've asked for the total number, and your department, and other agencies, have been unable to give us a number. Have you personally reviewed that universe of cases, both with regard to the total number and the specific circumstances--perhaps common threads--of those cases?""""I can't tell you that I have. I can tell you two things,"" Rodriguez replied, saying he's ""reviewed a lot of cases"" and that the DHS reviews cases to ""make improvements"" after refugees are arrested for attempting to carry out a terrorist attack against Americans.""But shouldn't you know the total number in that universe?"" Vitter asked.Rodriguez was speechless for a moment. ""Perhaps we know it as an agency--I, I, I, I have some rough sense of the number, I don't specifically know the number.""Vitter said his office had asked that question for months and never got a direct response. ""You're in charge of the program. It seems to me you should darn well know what the number is, and it seems to me you should review those cases, all of those cases to look for common threads.""Vitter also cited FBI director James Comey's statements that the U.S. government cannot conduct thorough background checks on the refugees it's importing, and has nothing on intelligence besides what it's collected on its own. ""In the vast majority of Syrian cases, that's nothing, correct?"" he asked.""Well, in part because we would hope that a lot of those folks are not coming up on those intelligence databases at all,"" Rodriguez evaded. ""In fact, this has been my observation meeting them. They are law-abiding, working people who are coming here to find a better life. That's why they would not appear in those kinds of databases.""""But you do admit that there are terrorists who are not on those databases,"" Vitter said.""I don't know,"" Rodriguez said. ""I don't know. I can't guarantee every single terrorist is in those databases. What I can tell you is we have identified--""""Hold on, let's back up,"" Vitter replied. ""We can all agree, isn't it clear that every single terrorist is not on those databases? Isn't that a virtual certainty?""""I think that's true regardless of what country they're coming from, and how they're coming here, and in fact whether they're born in the United States to begin with. The point I am making--first of all, I would not dismiss the interview process so quickly,"" Rodriguez said, adding that the interviewers were ""highly trained.""Rodriguez went on: ""The track record stands for itself: Significant numbers of people have been denied because of what is in those databases and it is in fact a high priority of government to develop as much and as robust information as we can about these organizations.""""Is part of the 'track record' terrorist prosecutions of folks who came in through the refugee program?"" Vitter asked.""Without a doubt, that's something that has occurred, yes,"" the official admitted.Earlier in the Senate's Judiciary Committee hearing, another Obama administration official refused to say how many Syrians the government plans to ship to the U.S. as refugees. The administration set in motion plans to pour 110,000 refugees into American communities in fiscal year 2017, which begins October 1.The hearing comes as a DHS revealed over 1,811 aliens from terrorist countries under final deportation orders were granted U.S. citizenship--giving them the right to vote and gain security clearances--and the Obama administration shut down the program that uncovered the rampant fraud.Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions' office found in June that of the 580 people convicted of terrorism-related offenses between September 11, 2001, and December 31, 2014, not including the Muslims who perpetrated the 9/11 terror attacks, 380 were foreign-born, with 24 of those brought in as refugees.SIGN UP"	['Vitter', 'Obama']	[]

Ohio.In Terry, the Supreme Court held:When an officer is justified in believing that the individual whose suspicious behavior he is investigating at close range is armed and presently dangerous to the officer or to others, it would appear to be clearly unreasonable to deny the officer the power to take necessary measures to determine whether the person is in fact carrying a weapon and to neutralize the threat of physical harm.For the sake of protecting the officer's safety, and the safety of other people in the area, the Court concluded, the Fourth Amendment allows an officer ""to conduct a carefully limited search of the outer clothing of such persons in an attempt to discover weapons which might be used against him.""The lone dissenter in Terry, Justice William Douglas, wrote that the Fourth Amendment only allows a pat-down if the officer has probable cause to suspect a crime. All eight other justices--including archliberal Justice William Brennan--rejected that argument, in an opinion written by the most liberal chief justice the nation has ever had, Chief Justice Earl Warren.Constitutional scholars know that 1968 was the most liberal year in the more than two centuries of the Supreme Court's existence. Even the most liberal Supreme Court in American history rejected Clinton's position by an 8-1 margin. But that's exactly the position of Clinton and de Blasio.It's also the view of the only judge to rule against stop-and-frisk, Judge Shira Scheindlin. Well known as a liberal judicial activist, Scheindlin took unusual measures to ensure that she would get the case (claiming that it was linked to a previous case of hers that had been closed years ago), and then launched an angry broadside against police powers.Scheindlin has been repeatedly reversed--unanimously--by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on cases involving police authority, and even terrorism. She has demonstrated such extraordinary bias as a judicial activist on this issue that the federal appeals court took the extremely rare action of ordering her removed from the case.But her removal was not before she issued a decision declaring that stop-and-frisk was unconstitutional the way it was being implemented. Note that even Scheindlin would not say it was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court's Terry case would make her a laughingstock if she took that position (which is the position that Hillary Clinton took in the debate). But Scheindlin said it was being applied in an unconstitutional manner that focused too heavily on blacks and Hispanics.Many legal experts expected the Second Circuit to smack down Scheindlin yet again. But then de Blasio was elected, and he withdrew the appeal from the Second Circuit before they could rule on the case and announced he was ending stop-and-frisk.So the Supreme Court says Clinton is wrong, and even an ultra-left judicial activist would not go as far as Clinton's false claim during her debate against Trump.But with the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, unless Trump wins in November, Clinton will have the power to remake the Supreme Court in her own image, taking it far to the left of even 1968, and completely reinterpret the Fourth Amendment--along with the rest of the Constitution.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

Mark Meadows (R.-N.C.), who voted in favor of the override. The 348-to-77 vote came shortly after the Senate also voted 97-to-1 to override the veto of the JASTA bill. The bill authorizes victims of state-sponsored terrorism to sue foreign countries in U.S. courts.""I am encouraged to see that both the Senate and the House recognizes what is important to the American people and hopefully the president will understand the sentiment that is out there on Main Street,"" Meadows said.""Obviously, any time you can advocate on behalf of the American people, whether its a veto override or getting a bill passed, it is critical,"" he added, concluding, ""This was the right thing to do at the right time for the American people.""Only 15 presidents have completed their terms without a veto override. Congress override George W. Bush four times, William J. Clinton twice and Ronald W. Reagan nine times.One of the bill's co-sponsor's Rep. Stephen Lynch (D.-Mass.) told Breitbart News he was motivated by the stories of the families of the Massachusetts victims of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Both the planes that hit the World Trade Center towers took off from Boston's Logan Airport. ""Sympathy for the families was a big part of my vote.""The congressman said another motivation was his discomfort with foreign countries like Saudi Arabia spreading radical forms of Islam and creating problems for the United States and her allies.""This is one way that we can hold them accountable,"" he said.Lynch said in the early days of preparing the legislation there was an opportunity to address the president's concerns and keep the bill focused simply on Saudi Arabia.But, the White House concentrated all its efforts on stopping the override in the Senate, he said. ""They didn't have any success over there that I can see and here they spent very little time working with members and got a better result-I don't know what that tells you.""Eddie Bracken, the brother of Lucy Fishman, who died on the 105th floor of the World Trade Center's second tower during the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, told Breitbart News when he heard the news that Congress overrode the president's veto of JASTA, he was thinking about his little sister.""She was actually going to take her son in for his first day of school, but her boss said no,"" Bracken said.""Her boss said: 'If you come in in the morning, you can go in the afternoon,' but, we know that never happened,"" he said.The Brooklyn native was working at the Javits Center that morning when he heard the news of the first plane hitting a tower. While talking to a co-worker, the two men decided to go outside and take a look. Just as they stepped out, they witnessed the second plane hit the other tower.""I figured she would be OK, but just to make sure, I started walking downtown to the towers,"" he said. ""I was walking one way and everyone else was running forward away from it and I'm trying to go see my sister down there.""When the towers collapsed, Bracken was still 30 blocks away, he said.""It was surreal. It was like out of the movies,"" he said. ""I'm just praying that she is OK, you know? It was crazy. People screaming. Full of dust. I didn't know the towers fell right away because there was such a cloud of smoke and I thought maybe it's just on fire. Then, when you heard it had fallen, you know, I personally didn't hear it, crumbling, but everything else from a distance I saw.""Bracken said he wanted the JASTA to pass because countries like Saudi Arabia are supposed to be our allies, but they actually attack us.""I knew we had a fight ahead of us,"" he said.""I knew the Saudis had a lot of money and they have a lot of clout,"" he said.Bracken and other family members of the victims worked hard to convince congressmen and senators to pass JASTA and then to override the president, he said.""Even though some of them wanted to stand with the president, they knew they had to do the right thing,"" he said.One of the few Republicans voting to sustain the veto was Florida's Rep. David Jolly, who represents the peninsula across from Tampa, home of beach communities of Clearwater and St. Petersburg.Jolly said, ""I think there was some quiet indecision even among those who voted to override the veto.""The national security concerns were real, he said.""I don't think we litigate acts of war in civil court rooms-an act of terrorism is an act of war,"" said the Floridian, who is also an attorney.""This is a much harder issue than how it as been embraced by the politics of a November campaign,"" he said. ""My preference would have been to postpone the vote until after the election.""Montana Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke (R.-Mont.) told Breitbart News the override was not a sure thing.""It was not a foregone conclusion, but it happens so rarely, so from my perspective, the vote just felt good,"" he said.Zinke said part of the override reflects that he and other congressmen felt it was time to stand up for Congress as an institution.""I wish it was over Obamacare, I wish it was over Dodd-Frank, or one of the fundamental flaws in this administration, but from my perspective, it felt good that the House could rise,"" said the retired Navy SEAL.Upstate New York Republican Rep. John M. Katko told Breitbart News he sensed that everyone in the chamber knew the override was going to happen.""It was the right thing to do,"" he said. ""I know the concerns of the White House and I respect their concerns, but there's an awful lot of people on both sides of the aisle that fell differently.""Terry Strada, the national chair of the organization fighting for JASTA, 9/11 Families United for Justice Against Terrorism, released a statement after the House override:We are overwhelmingly grateful that Congress did not let us down. The victims of 9/11 have fought for 15 long years to make sure that those responsible for the senseless murder of thousands of innocent men, women and children, and injuries to thousands others, are held accountable. JASTA becoming law is a tremendous victory toward that effort. We rejoice in this triumph and look forward to our day in court and a time when we may finally get more answers regarding who was truly behind the attacks.We are overwhelmingly grateful that Congress did not let us down.

He's also spoken out against President Barack Obama's campaign to subject state and local police forces to federal regulation.Bluntson, who is familiar with Clarke's political stances, said the sheriff was not ""one of us.""A passenger on the flight who asked The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel not to be named said that Bluntson was loud and disruptive, directing his comments to Clarke sitting at the back of the plane.

Since most people stopped paying attention after the first 30 minutes, that's a win for Trump.Hillary supporters, or ""the media,"" had reason to be happy: She looked healthy! She probably could have kept reciting her snarky little talking points for another hour.In fact, it was the best I've ever seen Hillary. She avoided that honking thing she does, smiled a lot -- a little too much, actually (maybe ease up on the pep pills next time) -- and, as the entire media has gleefully reported, she managed to ""bait"" Trump.Note to the Trump campaign: While it may seem studly that Hillary's best performance versus Trump's worst ends in a draw, on Nov. 9, no one wants to say: We almost won -- and our guy didn't prepare!The media's excitement over Hillary successfully ""baiting"" Trump is revealing -- of the media, of what this election is really about, and of what Trump needs to do now.The definition of Trump ""taking the bait"" was getting him to talk about himself, not about issues. This from a media that claim to be aching for ""policy specifics.""Hillary -- with assists from the moderator -- ""baited"" Trump on how rich he is, the loan from his father, a lawsuit in 1972, the birther claims, who he said what to about the Iraq War from 2001 to 2003, and so on.For the media, their gal was winning whenever precious minutes of a 90-minute debate were spent rehashing allegations about Trump. Ha ha! We prevented Trump from talking about issues that matter to the American people! That was scored as a ""win.""Nothing illustrates more clearly that this election is about the people versus the elites than the fact that the media run from Trump's issues like Dracula from the sun.Trump wins whenever he talks about issues; he loses whenever he talks about himself.Trump was winning when he talked about the heinous trade deals that have shipped jobs abroad and immiserated millions of Americans -- which Hillary supports. He was winning when he talked about bringing order and safety to black neighborhoods overrun with crime; Hillary's with the criminals. He was winning when he talked about rebuilding our inner cities, instead of saying, ""Vote for me!"" then, ""See you in four years!"" -- as Hillary does.Unlike the media, ordinary people don't care about Trump's taxes or net worth or the things he said as an entertainer. Trump will be dead and gone in 30 years. But whether America continues to exist or becomes some dystopian blend of Guatemala and Afghanistan will be determined by this election.It's almost impossible not to correct a lie, especially about yourself, which is why Hillary and Lester Holt's ""baiting"" strategy was to make outrageous claims about Trump.Hillary, for example, criticized Trump for not releasing his tax returns, saying, ""maybe ... he's paid nothing in federal taxes.""This is exactly what Sen. Harry Reid stated as hard fact about Romney in 2012 -- on the Senate floor, so he couldn't be sued. After the election was over, Reid was asked about this obvious falsehood. He laughed it off and said, ""Romney didn't win, did he?""This is the game they play.Trump has got to learn to ignore it. The voters have. They don't care about his taxes. They want jobs, they want a wall and they'd like fewer Muslims showing up, collecting welfare, then killing Americans.Trump doesn't have to do formal debate practice, standing at a podium, facing off against a shorty in pantsuit. But he does need Pavlovian training to stop responding to irrelevancies.This isn't about him! It's about a movement of the people to take back their government from an arrogant plutocracy.From now until the next debate, every single person who works for Trump should personally insult him several times a day.Good morning, sir -- your business is a total fraud. Here are those trade stats you wanted -- oh and you lied about opposing the war in Iraq. The Cincinnati airport needs a tail number -- why did you ""fat-shame"" that poor girl?If he starts to respond, they should say, ""No one cares, sir. Tell me how you're going to stop Mexican drugs from pouring across our border.""The proof that voters don't care about the personal attacks on Trump is that, even after his lazy and self-indulgent debate performance, he won nearly every online poll.Evidently, the American people have sized up the candidates and decided they want Trump. But there's just one last formality: He needs to pass some minimum threshold, a basic job requirement - like proving he has a drivers license.Everybody agrees he's got the job. It's too late for Hillary to be sucking up to the hiring committee, reminding them, but I took driver's ed seven times -- yes, there were mistakes, but I was grilled for 11 hours about that vehicular homicide. Also, the Russians hacked my GPS.Trump showed up at the debate with his driver's license. That's all anyone needed to see.SIGN UP"	['Reid', 'Romney', 'Trump']	[]

It now appears the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has aligned with that notion.In a new report by Charlotte's WCNC TV, a spokesman for the NAACP called out for justice for the death of Scott but in a statement also insisted that the race of the officer doesn't count because black police officers give up their blackness when they don the blue.""Many black people who become police officers become blue, not black,"" the organization told the station.

He said ""a Manville High School teacher instructed him to create a video arguing against gun control for a junior college readiness class last year"" and that ""video,,,provided examples of people who used guns to defend themselves from home invaders.""The thumb drive was discovered and turned over to the school administration, which then called police. The police ""cleared Harvey"" of any wrong doing, yet ""district officials suspended him and said he'd have to undergo a five-hour evaluation before being allowed back in school."" The administration said the teacher who would have assigned the project does not remember doing so.Harvey's mother chose to pull him from the school rather than have her son subjected to the psychological exam.

That could be by a foreign power. Actually, that's rather easy to do, so it could be by a bunch of high school kids here or anywhere in the world.He described the federal approach to dealing with that threat and why state governments are resisting it:So what has happened is, the Homeland security secretary, Mr. Johnson, is considering adding to the list of what we call ""critical infrastructure,"" which at the moment includes things like our electrical distribution grid, our air traffic control, bank and stock exchanges, and so on. He's thinking of adding the election system. And he's not just thinking of it. He's actually established something called the Election Infrastructure Cyber-Security Working Group, and he's launching as we talk a voting infrastructure cyber-security action campaign.The states are fighting back. Something called the National Association of Secretaries of State has just written a letter to all members of Congress, basically saying, ""Hey, we've got this under control. Don't worry about it. We don't need federal oversight.""And yet, more and more, media on both sides, all sides, are saying this is a serious threat. I've identified at least five major factors which are, to my way, saying we are heading into a perfect storm this election, and we'd better watch out.Banzhaf elaborated on his ""perfect storm"" theory in a PRLog article, in which he described the other four factors as the nature of the Electoral College, the increased use of electronic voting machines, the connection of electoral computer systems to the Internet, and the way some states allow residents to vote online.He reviewed these ""perfect storm"" factors for Breitbart News Daily listeners, providing some examples:Remember that Illinois and Arizona, their election systems were hacked. The FBI did an investigation, and one of the most astonishing things they found out is that this was not a bunch of master hackers. This was not a major foreign power with a lot of hacking ability. They were using common programs, which you or I could download from the Internet and do it. We have two professors who have just gone out and shown just how easy it is.Secondly, we have the Electoral College. We can't change that. But what it means is that instead of having a direct election, where you'd have to probably change millions of votes to change the outcome, you could actually change the outcome in only one or two states, and possibly change who the next president is.Remember, back in 2000, it was about a thousand votes out of six million in Florida. And so if you change only about five or six hundred, you could have changed the whole presidential race. Third, we've got more and more electronic voting machines, with no paper trail, no audit trail. Somebody fools around with the software, we have no way of going back and checking it and seeing what happened. We also have more and more computers which are connected to the Internet, and by God, if there's one thing we know today: if it's connected to the Internet, it can be hacked. Just yesterday, it was Yahoo. It's the Democratic Party, it's the White House, it's the Pentagon, and so on. And fifth is that there are still some states which allow their voters to cast their votes from home, over the Internet. Banzhaf had some suggestions for improving the election system, acknowledging that the Electoral College will remain an intractable structural problem, so the other four factors in the ""perfect storm"" should be the focus of reform efforts:So we know a couple of things we can do. We can't, obviously, change the Electoral College. We can, for example, tell people not to have any of the computers connected with the election connected in any way to the Internet.

Monday's game between the Atlanta Falcons and the New Orleans Saints received a low 5.7 rating, a 38 percent plunge from week three of last year.Notably, the game was competing against the first presidential debate between Trump and Clinton, an event that earned the biggest debate audience in U.S. political history. According to CNN Money, the September 26 debate brought in more than 80 million viewers.But the NFL has also been suffering under the anti-American protests during the playing of the national anthem, which San Francisco 49ers second string quarterback Colin Kaepernick started three weeks ago.Since Kaepernick decided to sit out the anthem instead of standing at attention as everyone else was doing, a host of other players across the NFL have joined him in his attack on the United States.Some have decided to emulate Kaepernick's action of staying seated during the anthem. Others took up his secondary protest of kneeling in the field during the song. Still others have taken to raising the militant black power fist in the air during the anthem.Not content with his on-field protests, Kaepernick has continued his anti-American rants off the field. Recently, as a rejoinder to GOP nominee Donald Trump, he said the United States was never great.""He always says, 'Make America great again,'"" Kaepernick said of Trump. ""Well, America has never been great for people of color and that's something that needs to be addressed.

Paul Ryan Refuses to Rule Out Running for President: ‘Never Say Never’	"On Wednesday morning, House Speaker Paul Ryan ""appeared to crack the door"" to a future presidential run, according to reports.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERWhile addressing the Economic Club of Washington D.C. on Wednesday, Ryan was asked whether he would consider running for president.""You never say never to these things...but I've never really had this ambition,"" Ryan said.""I have presidential-size policy ambition,"" Ryan added. ""I've really never had presidential-size personal ambition. It just was never really in my DNA.""However, just last year, Speaker Ryan repeatedly insisted that he did not ""want"" or have the ambition to become House Speaker.""Maybe it's just the phase of life I'm in,"" Ryan told attendees of the Economic Club on Wednesday. ""One of the reasons I didn't do it this last time is because my kids are young and want to be normal.""Again, Ryan used a similar line in 2015 while then explaining why he would not be Speaker of the House: ""This [i.e. House Speaker] is a job for an empty nester,"" Ryan said last year.According to Politico, the moderator followed up with Ryan and observed that he would have time to run for President once his children were older. When the moderator asked if Ryan would ever run in the next ""'25-year period,' Ryan wouldn't say no,"" Politico reports.""Who knows,"" Ryan said in response.Ryan would presumably run as a Republican, however, polls show that on the two of the most significant issues of the 2016 election, Ryan finds himself on the opposite side of roughly 9 in 10 Republican voters.On the issue of trade, Ryan has a long record of being a vocal advocate for global trade. Yet a recent POLITICO pro-Harvard poll found that 85% of Republicans believe that so-called ""free trade"" has lost more U.S. jobs than it has created. The poll also found that 66% of Republicans believe that free trade has lowered U.S. wages. By a nearly three-to-one margin, Republicans believe free trade agreements have ""hurt"" their community rather than helped it.Similarly, according to Pew polling data, Ryan's position on immigration is opposed by 92 percent of the GOP electorate. Pew found that more than 9 in 10 Republicans would like to see immigration levels frozen or reduced. However, Ryan has a two-decade-long history of pushing to increase the nation's already record high rate of immigration.However, the polling data demonstrating the Republican electorate's opposition to his policy positions may be of little concern to the Republican House Speaker's presidential ambitions. In recent years, Ryan has gained a reputation amongst conservatives for pushing his own personal agenda regardless of the wishes of the electorate he is supposed to represent.As Lou Dobbs has explained:Yes, he [Paul Ryan] has an agenda. It's not that of the party. It is his own agenda. He is working hard to promote not the convention but himself... To date he's been far more divisive than his words and actions though Ryan has spent more of his breath slamming the Republican nominee -- the one chosen by record number of Republican voters. And all the while Ryan pushing his own certainly irrelevant agenda instead of working to unify the party behind Trump and Trump's agenda that shared by millions and millions of voters. Ryan is proving himself to be nothing more than an eager tool of the establishment and for the big donors like Paul Singer or Charles Koch or the most powerful lobby in D.C., the Chamber of Commerce...  In my opinion, Speaker Ryan has become something of a tiresome tremendous embarrassment for the Republican Party... [he] has made himself a sad spectacle.As President Obama wraps up the final months of his Presidency, Paul Ryan is now working to pass his so-called ""criminal sentencing"" rewrite during the lame duck session of Congress. The plan could slash sentences for many federal prison inmates, prompting critics of the Obama-Ryan ""criminal sentencing"" agenda to dub it Ryan's ""prison break"" agenda. Critics of the plan include Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions and Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke. Yet Ryan has pushed back against critics, arguing that rather than locking criminals up, we need to ""unlock their potential.""""Instead of locking people up, why don't we unlock their potential?"" Ryan asked in a video message promoted on Twitter.Ryan's efforts to push so-called ""criminal sentencing reform"" come as millions of Republican voters overwhelmingly selected as their party's standard bearer a Republican nominee who has branded himself as the ""law and order"" candidate, and who, if elected President, would likely oppose Ryan's criminal sentencing rewrite.Yes, he [Paul Ryan] has an agenda. It's not that of the party. It is his own agenda. He is working hard to promote not the convention but himself...

Both Senators and Congressmen voted Wednesday in favor of overriding the president's move. The vote passed the bill as a statute, marking the first time Congress has quashed a veto during Obama's two terms in office.The GCC, a six-member coalition of Gulf Arab states that includes Saudi Arabia, expressed concern when the U.S. Congress passed the bill earlier this month. Saudi Arabia, a longstanding ally of the United States, has been described as the GCC's most powerful member.In a statement issued September 12, Abdullatif al-Zayani, secretary general of the GCC, said the law ""contravenes the foundations and principles of relations between states, notably sovereign immunity,"" adding that it ""will create a grave precedent.""""This should be clear to America and to the rest of the world: When one GCC state is targeted unfairly, the others stand around it,"" Abdulkhaleq Abdullah, an Emirati Gulf specialist and professor of political science at United Arab Emirates University, told AP after the U.S. senate's veto override Wednesday.""All the states will stand by Saudi Arabia in every way possible,"" he also said.Abdullah noted that if the bill is enacted into law, he expects the GCC will take action that is more assertive and independent of the U.S. in places like Yemen, Bahrain and Egypt.""This is not just a threat. This is a reality,"" he declared.Of the 19 al Qaeda plane hijackers who carried out the September 11, 2001 attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people on U.S. soil, 15 called Saudi Arabia home.In an op-ed that was first published on the London-based Saudi daily Al-Sharq Al-Awsat, Abdulrahman al-Rashed, the former general manager of the kingdom's Al Arabiya News Channel, wrote of the bills passage by the U.S. congress:It is not reasonable to accuse the very country which the al-Qaeda organization has targeted the most.Al-Qaeda has been attacking Saudi Arabia since 1995...calling Saudi Arabia guilty is like accusing companies such as Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube of being responsible for the actions of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) because users of those online platforms express extremist opinions!It is nonsensical to accuse any government of a crime due to the existence of extremist ideology within its borders as this could apply to many countries in the world.The kingdom maintains an arsenal of tools to retaliate with, including curtailing official contacts, pulling billions of dollars from the US economy, and persuading its close allies in the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] to scale back counterterrorism cooperation, investments and US access to important regional air bases.It is not reasonable to accuse the very country which the al-Qaeda organization has targeted the most.

From Henshaw's testimony, it's unclear how many the administration will ship to the continental U.S.Ninety-one percent of Middle Eastern refugees go on food stamps,73.1 percent depend on Medicaid or Refugee Medical Assistance,and 68.3 percent take cash assistance from taxpayers, according to Office of Refugee Resettlement.Each unskilled migrant costs taxpayers roughly $640,000 in long-term spending, and also pressure down wages for unskilled Americans and prior immigrants, according to a Sept.  2016 report by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine. that calculation suggests that the planned 110,000 migrants will cost Americans and their children roughly $70.4 billion over the next 75 years.SIGN UP"	['Grassley', 'Obama']	[]

To override a presidential veto, both houses of Congress must vote with two-thirds majorities.Saudi Arabia is the target of this bill and the U.S. capital has been inundated with family members of those killed during 9/11 for the last two weeks.Previously, lawsuits against Saudi Arabia have been dismissed, but with JASTA, the families have standing.JASTA passed the Senate by a voice vote on May 17 and passed the House unanimously Sept. 23. That same day, President Obama vetoed the bill. In his veto message, the president said he had three reasons:1. Lawsuits by private citizens could complicate American relationships outside of official channels2. JASTA overturns the Common Law understanding that international relationships are conducted sovereign government to sovereign government, and3. Allies of the United States are concerned that while cooperating with the U.S. government, they might be exposed to legal jeopardy by an generous reading of the statue.""I have deep sympathy for the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, who have suffered grievously"" the president said in his veto message to Congress.""I also have a deep appreciation of these families' desire to pursue justice and am strongly committed to assisting them in their efforts,"" he said.""The United States has taken robust and wide-ranging actions to provide justice for the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks and keep Americans safe, from providing financial compensation for victims and their families to conducting worldwide counter terrorism programs to bringing criminal charges against culpable individuals,"" the president said.""I have continued and expanded upon these efforts, both to help victims of terrorism gain justice for the loss and suffering of their loved ones and to protect the United States from future attacks. The JASTA, however, does not contribute to these goals, does not enhance the safety of Americans from terrorist attacks, and undermines core U.S. interests,"" he concluded.Only 15 presidents have gone their whole terms without a veto overriden.

It is in Trump's best interest to point out that he is not a politician and he will shake up things in Washington,"" she added.Matt Beynon, who served as Sen. Rick Santorum's spokesperson during the GOP primary, agreed with Bass that it was smart for Trump to remind voters that Clinton is an establishment politician and has been ""part of the problem for the past 25 years.""Beynon pointed to one particular exchange between Trump and Clinton on trade -- specifically the North American Free Trade Agreement.""She's been doing this for 30 years.

Murphy: Democrats Should Politicize Mass Shootings ‘Within an Hour’ of Occurrence	"In an interview published September 28, Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) said there is nothing wrong with politicizing mass shootings and even indicated such politicization should begin ""within an hour"" of such a heinous incident.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERHe said he made a mistake by waiting too long after the attack on Sandy Hook Elementary and he vowed that he would not wait again before pushing gun control.According to The Washington Post, Murphy said:You cannot accept the premise that there is any waiting period after a tragedy to start engaging in political action, I think you need to be unapologetic about that. I am talking about legislative action within an hour of a shooting. These shootings won't stop unless we move seamlessly from tragedy to action.Murphy highlighted his change in approach by pointing to his response to the June 12 Orlando terror attack. ""Within days"" of the attack he ""[seized] the Senate floor for a 15-hour filibuster in pursuit of gun control."" His goal was the passage of a bill ""that would ban people on the terrorist watch list from buying a gun."" Murphy secured a vote on the bill, but it was voted down.The larger lesson is that Murphy's eagerness to politicize actually led him to hold a filibuster for a bill that would not have even prevented the Orlando terror attack. After all, the Orlando gunman was not on a terror watch list.This is a problem Democrats run into over and again as they seek out microphones and cameras in the immediate aftermath of a heinous attack. President Obama proved this in October, when he reacted to the Umpqua Community College attack with calls for more gun control.The Post claims Obama had momentum on his side, as ""9 in 10 Americans supported some form of background checks."" But days later it was learned that the Umpqua Community College gunman acquired his guns via background checks.It is interesting to note Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) used the Sandy Hook Elementary attack as an opportunity to push gun control that would not have prevented the attack had the proposed controls been in place beforehand. Although he did not push his calls for more gun control immediately after the attack, he did set a precedent for Democrats who quickly emerged with a gun control plan that had nothing to do with the attack that birthed it.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
