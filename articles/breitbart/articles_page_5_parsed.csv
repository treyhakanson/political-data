Not only did the GOP win the presidency with the election of Donald J. Trump, but it also retained control of the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives, and won gains at the state level across the country.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERHowever, California once again was an outlier. Democrats had a strong night in the Golden State -- most significantly picking up at least two, and probably three seats in the State Assembly, recapturing a super-majority that they had gained in 2012, but lost in 2014.Election ballots continue to be counted, a week after the polls have closed, because of the massive number of absentee ballots mailed late and turned in at polling places. There was also a large number of provisional ballots, which are typically issued to someone who says they are registered but they aren't on the list at the local precinct.Some races are so close that the winner could not be determined Election Night, because of these remaining ballots to be cast.  Assemblyman David Hadley's (R-Redondo Beach) defeat by former Assemblyman Al Muratsuchi was called early.  But with more ballots in, it is clear that Assemblyman Eric Linder (R-Corona) has been defeated by Sabrina Cervantes, an former aide to Democratic Assemblyman Jose Medina.  Linder's defeat officially gives Democrats the 54 members they need to have a supermajority.One final race remained too close to call in Orange County, where Assemblywoman Young Kim (R-Fullerton) is losing to former Assemblywoman Sharon Quirk-Silva by just a few thousand votes, with around 200,000 ballots left to count countywide.It would appear that Republicans will have have held onto their 14-seat position in the State Senate, depriving Democrats of a supermajority in the upper chamber, but without a vote to spare.  Opportunities for Democrat pickups in the Senate were scarce, with most of the attention being paid to the 29th district, which straddles Los Angeles and Orange County. While that seat has been in GOP hands, currently occupied by term-limited former GOP Senate Leader Bob Huff, it has seen a significant shift in voter registration favorable to Democrats.  Nevertheless, Assemblywoman Ling Ling Chang (R-Diamond Bar) has a substantial enough lead over Democrat businessman Josh Newman that it appears very unlikely the remaining ballots left to be counted would change the outcome.Attaining a supermajority in both chambers would have allowed Democrats to be able to pass tax increases, pass urgency legislation (to go into effect immediately), and place measures on the ballot -- without a single Republican vote.California is now one of only four states nationally where Democrats control the sovernorship and hold majorities in both legislative chambers.  The other three states are Hawaii, Oregon and Rhode Island.SIGN UP	[]	[]

""Trump effectively rode that anger all the way to the White House,"" Spross writes.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFrom The Week:In the Democrats' defense, [voting for the bank bailouts] was no easy choice: Either sanction the grossly unjust bank bailouts on the table from Bush, or risk an even more catastrophic collapse while a possible alternative was (maybe) worked out. But that doesn't change the fact that Democrats did pass the bank bailouts. And when Obama took over and continued to play ball with the banks, he assured the bailouts would be forever politically tied around the Democrats' neck.What the Democrats did next was even worse: The Obama administration's efforts to provide relief to homeowners through the 2009 stimulus were paltry and fell flat. Nor did Obama really push the Federal Housing Finance Agency to start rescuing underwater homeowners. The executive branch's law enforcers failed to use charges of rampant mortgage fraud to force the banks to write down homeowners' debt. And of course, they decided to forego prosecuting Wall Street executives.Is it any wonder much of America thinks Democrats are in thrall to wealthy elites while ignoring the middle and working classes?Bannon is right that the titans of finance who cratered the U.S. economy were never held accountable. He's right that regular Americans were largely ignored in the wake of the crash. He's right that much of this is Democrats' fault. And he's especially right that millions of Americans are still mad as hell about it.Read the rest here.SIGN UP"	['Obama']	[]

Donald Trump is one of those who do, but it was Steve Bannon, the CEO of Trump's presidential campaign, who put it on Trump's radar and made it a centerpiece of Trumps ""New Deal for Black America.""SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERI happen to know this because I was responsible for drawing Bannon's attention to it in the first place. I bring this up now, not to draw attention to anything I have done, but to defend a man who has been viciously and baselessly portrayed as a ""white nationalist"" and ""racist,"" who has put himself on the line for black America in a way that few others have.The attempt by desperate, hysterical and malicious voices on the left to isolate, stigmatize and silence Steve Bannon as a ""white nationalist,"" is despicable, not least because that is the very last thing he is.""School choice"" is a term to describe the provision of scholarships to poor children who are trapped in inner city public schools where year in and year out nearly half of them fail to graduate and the half who do are functionally illiterate and unable to function in a modern economy. These scholarships or ""vouchers"" would allow poor children to take the tuition that taxpayers already provide, and use it in a school, private or religious, that would actually teach them.Vouchers are absolutely vital to opening the doors of opportunity to millions of poor black and Hispanic children - and poor white children as well. Democrats are fiercely opposed to vouchers because giving parents the power to choose would break the Democrats' monopoly, undermine the lock that teacher unions have on the public schools, and threaten the slush fund that the unions provide to the Democratic Party. At the same time, Democrats - the Obamas and Clintons prominent among them - send their own children to private schools where they know they will get a decent education.Republicans have long proposed voucher systems. But their proposals have failed because of the myopia and timidity that characterizes the Republican establishment. The voucher amounts they propose are too small - far less than an actual tuition - and the programs too modest to gain public attention and therefore support. Sixteen years ago, to get around this deficiency, I proposed to the top advisors of the Bush presidential campaign that they announce a $100 billion voucher program for inner city children. They passed on it. I also got my friend Congressman James Rogan to draw up a bill to do the same. It went nowhere.Then Donald Trump came along and made my friend Steve Miller his chief policy advisor and my friend Steve Bannon the CEO of his presidential campaign. So I put a voucher proposal on their desks, stressing that it had to be more than $100 billion so the press couldn't ignore it, and that it had to provide a tuition equivalent to what taxpayers were already paying to the public schools for not teaching their students.Steve Bannon gave it the green light and Steve Miller went to work on the details. Under Bannon's guidance, it soon appeared in a Trump speech in Cleveland as a $130 billion scholarship program for inner city youth. ""As your president,"" Trump announced, ""I will become the nation's biggest cheerleader for school choice."" Under Bannon's guidance again it became the centerpiece of Donald Trump's ""New Deal for Black America,"" which also included making black neighborhoods safe and bringing jobs to the inner city.I can't say enough about Donald Trump and his general, Steve Bannon, for getting behind a plan to liberate the children of the inner cities.I had spent the last sixteen years banging my head against the stone wall of the Republican Party trying to persuade congressmen, senators, and the Bush White House of the importance and urgency of such a plan. But my pleas fell on deaf ears.The school choice movement had been wandering in the wilderness for want of national leadership even longer. Millions of inner city children had been lost in those years for want of a decent education. Now the wall had come down, and there was a real prospect for something to be done.School choice is now a presidential priority. It could never have happened without Steve Bannon. It could never have happened without someone in a position like Steve's who cared about what happened to inner city children and who was willing to put his weight behind a program this ambitious, which no other Republican would touch.When the history of the 21st Century civil rights movement is written Steve Bannon's name will have a special place in its pantheon of heroes.SIGN UP"	['Black', 'Trump', 'Deal']	[]

State and local governments that adopt laws designed specifically to infringe on the rights of honest firearms owners or discourage people from exercising their right to keep and bear arms for legitimate reasons, including self-defense should be held accountable.Gottlieb pointed to the ""good cause"" laws in California, New Jersey, and elsewhere as glaring examples of state-level laws that ""infringe on the rights of honest firearms owners."" These laws forbid law-abiding Americans from bearing arms for self-defense unless they can persuade an agent of the state that they have ""good cause"" for so doing. He pointed out that other states ""make obtaining a permit prohibitively expensive for average wage earners,"" which is simply a backdoor means of denying the right to bear arms to large numbers of law-abiding citizens.Gottlieb said, ""Donald Trump has been given an opportunity to right so many of the wrongs that have been committed against millions of citizens whose only crime has been a wish to exercise their constitutionally-delineated civil rights,"" adding, ""He campaigned on a pledge to make America great again.

"Second of a SeriesSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER1. The Democrats Assess In previous articles, we explored the Democrats' likely trouble in the near term, and also the Democrats' potential for a comeback in the long term.   As the wise say, there are no final victories. Next, we'll consider how Republicans can hold on to their grip on the White House and on to their majorities in Congress.  And we'll consider these matters in two parts: First, we'll look at how parties have stayed on top in the past. Second, and even more importantly, we'll look at how a governing party can truly earn its enduring majority. To be sure, in the immediate here and now, there's good news--and more good news.  For instance, The Washington Post reports that in the wake of the recent elections, no fewer than 25 states will have both a Republican governor and a Republican-controlled legislature. Moreover, Hillary Clinton's defeat seems to have let loose a whole farrago of Democratic reckoning, score-settling, and maybe even confessing. For example, on Election Night, November 8, MSNBC host Chris Matthews said that Hillary Clinton's loss to Trump was because ""He's on the popular side of trade, immigration and stupid wars.""  And then, for good measure, Matthews used the phrase ""stupid wars"" again, thereby underscoring that Clinton, not Donald Trump, was the candidate of more vainglorious Middle East misadventure.  (If the reader wants some fun, click on this link and watch the stricken body language of Matthews' fellow panelists as he made his points.)Two days later, on November 10, Matthews was right back at it, speaking of the Democrats' snobbery: Did they disdain the sort of middle class Catholic voter, for example, that turned off Hillary. Did they look down on them? I think they did.  I get the feeling that a lot of it's cultural, not just economic. But wait!  Want more recriminations?  We've got 'em!  Post election, conservative blogger Dan McLaughlin sent out a mordantly understated tweet, ""Maybe, in retrospect, mocking Jim Webb out of the party was not a great idea.""  The tweet was referring, of course, to former US Sen. James Webb (D-VA), who epitomizes the old kind of Democrat--the flag-waving Democrats who supported Andrew Jackson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Harry Truman.  And so of course Webb had to be purged by Democrats.  And just as predictably, most Webb-type Democrats voted for Trump.  And there's more.  On Sunday, Sen. Bernie Sanders said on Face the Nation, ""Democrats have focused too much with a liberal elite while ignoring the working class.""Sanders then added that the Democrats lost because while they have been ""raising incredible sums of money from wealthy people, they have ignored to a very significant degree, working class, middle class, and low income people in this country.""Talk such as that, we can observe, won't get Sanders invited to any Clinton campaign reunions.   Meanwhile, here's New York Times columnist Frank Bruni, issuing an ex post facto confessional: Democrats adopted a strategy . . . that excluded a hefty share of Americans and consigned many to a ""basket of deplorables"" who aren't all deplorable.  Some are hurt.  Some are confused.  Liberals miss this by being illiberal. That's a strong final phrase from Bruni, eh?  Liberals are illiberal.   Indeed, Bruni went further, declaring that a typical middle-aged Southern woman who is not on board with gay marriage should not be characterized as a ""hateful boob.""  As Bruni noted, opposition to gay marriage was the ostensible position of Barack Obama and Clinton just five years ago.  Continuing to let fly, the Times man continued with this critique of a guiding ideology of the Democrats and the left: Political correctness has morphed into a moral purity that may feel exhilarating but isn't remotely tactical.  It's a handmaiden to smugness and sanctimony, undermining its own goals.Virgil can only say: While it's fun to read all this after-the-fact acrimony, it would have been nice if we'd been able read this sort of candor before the election.  In fact, such truth-telling might have even been good for Hillary Clinton, because it might have popped her and her team out of their solipsistic bubble.  Instead, Democrats made the biggest mistake a campaign can make: They believed their own propaganda.Yet of course, with apologies to James Carville, the big issue in 2016 was the economy, stupid.  In particular, as Peter Thiel said on the eve of the election, the gap between the connected and the unconnected has deepened into a chasm: Not everyone is hurting.  In the wealthy suburbs that ring Washington, D. C., people are doing just fine.  Where I work in Silicon Valley, people are doing just great.  But most Americans don't live by the beltway or the San Francisco Bay.  Most Americans haven't been part of that prosperity.  It shouldn't be surprising to see people vote for Bernie Sanders or for Donald Trump, who's the only outsider left in the race.Once again, after the election, Democrats are acknowledging this bifurcated reality.  Former Sen. Ken Salazar (D-Colo.), who had been tapped to run Clinton's White House transition team, had this to say to The Hill as he packed up to leave Washington and return to his ranch in Colorado:There were people who felt left out of he economy over the last eight years who were never able to get back on their feet, blue collar men and women.  Donald Trump was able to capture them in terms of emotion and sentiment.  . . . Democrats have not done very well in rural America and I don't understand why that has happened. Of course, any Republican would be happy to explain to Salazar why that happened, and in fact, Salazar, too, knows the answer, even if chose to profess wonderment.  And yet this last quote from him is inarguable: The broader question is how to have a Democratic Party that can attract those working men and women.Indeed, here at Breitbart, Virgil has noticed a profound reaction to the election in the reader comments.  For example, ""SunnyDtap"" wrote:Eight years of being told I am useless.  I don't matter.  I am the past. Everything I have is due to white privilege.  I am responsible for slavery. I am racist. I am a homophobe, Islamaphobe.  I hate women and gays.The commenter continued with this cry from the heart: What wrongs did I do?  Go to school, get married, have children, go to Church and go to work.And, another Breitbart commenter, ""CrustyChief"" offered a ""top ten"" list of variables that harmed the Democrats this year.  As we can see, one or two of these political wounds might count as bad luck, but most fall into the category of ""self-inflicted"": It will be interesting to see, in the years ahead, which of these injuries, if any, the Democrats seek to heal.  As Virgil has written, most likely, the National Democrats will not bother to attend to them, while, by contrast, Local Democrats will be avidly nursing them. In fact, we can already see some signs of Democratic healing.  For example, Democrats seem to have awoken from their Clintonian ensorcellment; now that the Queen of the Rigged Game has departed the national stage, more Democrats are free to speak freely.  In the words, again, of the Times' Frank Bruni, After Election Day, one Clinton-weary Democratic insider told me: ""I'm obviously not happy and I hate to admit this, but a part of me feels liberated. If she'd won, we'd already be talking about Chelsea's first campaign.  Now we can do what we really need to and start over.""As Virgil has written, Americans do not like dynasties.2.  The Quest for an Enduring Republican MajorityMeanwhile, among Republicans, it's worth absorbing that Trump won only 47.3 percent of the vote.  Okay, maybe we should put that ""only"" in quotes, because Trump won more than 60 million votes, which is quite a haul for a rookie politician.  Yet still, for her part, Clinton appears to have received about 600,000 more ballots.  Indeed, Trump's percentage of the vote is almost identical to that of Mitt Romney in 2012. The point here isn't to take anything away from Trump, but, rather,  looking ahead, to point out that Trump has yet to build a popular-vote majority.  We can say that that's what re-election campaigns are for, and that's a good answer--and yet in the meantime, amidst exulting in Trump's strength, we might yet examine some areas of weakness. For example, Trump lost six states in the West and Southwest--California, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington--with 94 electoral votes.Stipulating, of course, that Trump won the national balloting, it's still worth analyzing why Trump lost all that real estate, especially since three of those states--Colorado, New Mexico, and Nevada--were regarded as Republican presidential states as recently as 2004.Of course, there'll be plenty of time to consider all the possible explanations, but for now, the most obvious immediate answer is Hispanic immigration.  It was the Latino influx, mostly voting Democratic, that flipped California in the 90s; the Golden State had voted GOP in nine of ten presidential elections from 1952 to 1988, and yet, since, the GOP is zero-for-seven.Indeed, if we look to another state, Texas, we see also see signs of Republican erosion: Trump won the Lone Star State with less than 53 percent of the vote and, notably, lost Harris County (Houston) by a dozen points.  Indeed, Trump also lost adjacent Fort Bend County. So what's happening?  Here's a statistic to consider: A full 68 percent of Texans under age 19 are non-white.  Now of course, we should never fall into the ethnicity-is-destiny trap; that's a trap for the left, not the right.  Nor is Virgil making any sort of argument for ""comprehensive immigration reform""; from a Republican point of view, that's folly, at least until the border is 100 percent secured.  Indeed, there's plenty of evidence that Hispanics, too, want border security, out of concern for crime and chaos, of course, and also because they feel acutely the impact of a  wage-lowering rush of new job-seekers.  So what's needed for Republicans, and for America, is a color- and gender-blind commitment to full opportunity for all; a favoritism-free vision that's accessible to all Americans who are willing to honestly participate in the civic, economic, and patriotic aspects of American life.  (It's been called ""Rainbow Nationalism""-Virgil will have more on this in the next installment.)Yet of course, sadly, we are far from any positive vision nowadays, as some noisemakers continue to do nothing but attack Trump and his followers.   Indeed, the level of vituperation is so intense that Joe Scarborough said on Monday's Morning Joe that if it kept up, it would boomerang on the Democrats.  That is, if they  persist in hurling over-the-top epithets at Trump, then they will surely lose in future elections, because that in political terms, that wad was shot this year.  Yet as Virgil has predicted, the smarter Democrats will forgo the cheap attacks.  Indeed, the smartest and most ambitious Democrats--the ones, perhaps, with their eye on running for president in 2020--are going out of their way not to insult the voters.  Here, for example, are the words of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.); we can observe, below, that she specifically exculpates Trump voters--most of them, at least: There are many millions of people who did not vote for Donald Trump because of the bigotry and hate that fueled his campaign rallies. They voted for him despite the hate. They voted for him out of frustration and anger--and also out of hope that he would bring change.Yes, some Democrats are adjusting.  And in politics, adjustment--as opposed to dogmatism--can be a prelude to victory.  Indeed, for the opposition party, victory can happen surprisingly quickly.  For example, in 1984, President Ronald Reagan was re-elected, winning 49 states for a total of 525 electoral votes.  And yet just two years later, in the 1986 Congressional midterms, the Senate Republicans, enjoying all the fundraising advantages accruing to the majority, nevertheless hit an iceberg. That year Senate GOPers lost eight of their seats, thereby allowing the Democrats to regain the majority. We can further recall that even after that disastrous midterm result, the Republicans nevertheless remained potent; two years later, George H. W. Bush won the White House in a landslide.  So yes, the GOP was strong--but so were the Democrats, controlling, as they did, both chambers of Congress.  Politics is like that: Someone is always gaining on you, or at least, desperately trying to.  So yes, it's possible that Trump Republicans could face some tough midterms--perhaps in 2018, more likely, in 2022. So what's the answer?  There's only one answer.3. The Overprotection SolutionThere's an interesting concept from the game of chess that proves useful in politics: It's called overprotecting your position.  That is, if you're playing chess, and you're not quite sure what to do, it's almost always a good idea to build up your position in the center of the board.  That is, buttress your pawn structure with a knight, or a bishop, or a rook.That's because in chess, as in most things, the center is the most important space: It's the crossroads, it's where most of the action will be found.  Thus the injunction: Protect, even overprotect, your position, and you'll be better able to deal with whatever comes next.   And so, too, with politics.  The center is important, because that's where the most votes are.  So if a party controls the center, it will control the most votes, and thus the most political offices.Thus it's control of the center that enables a party to withstand the storm.  To illustrate this point, we might consider the Democrats of yore.  Back in the middle of the last century, Democrats were a motley crew: they had Northern liberals, and Southern conservatives; they had Catholics, Protestants, and Jews.  And while the various Democratic factions might not always have liked each other very much, they liked power more, and so they stuck together, because unity is strength. Yet even so, the Democrats went through severe political storms.  In the 1938 midterms, House Democrats lost a stunning 78 seats.  And in the 1942 midterms, they lost another 45.  Those were staggering losses!   But here's something interesting: Even after those two devastating midterms, the Democrats were still in charge.  Yes, when the 78th Congress convened in January 1943, it was House Speaker Sam Rayburn, Democrat of Texas, who was bringing down the gavel. And how did this happen?  How did the Democratic majority survive?  Answer: mathematics--the happy math of having won so many earlier elections. Here's how it went: In the early-to-mid 1930s, in response to both Herbert Hoover's Depression and Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, the House Democrats had built up a monster majority.  Crucially, while they took firm control of the House after the 1932 election, they kept going and going, adding more seats in the 1934 election--it's almost unheard of for a party to gain seats in a midterm--and then added still more during FDR's massive (46 out of 48 states) 1936 re-election.  Thus it was that in the 75th Congress, which first met in January 1937, the  Democratic majority had soared to more than 350, including allied third parties.  So that's how the Democrats could survive those deep losses in '38 and '42.  They had built themselves a big fat cushion.  Indeed, in the 62 years from 1932 to 1994, the Democrats held a majority in the House for all but four of those years.  Now that's domination!  That's the sort of political success that a party gets when it has a strong apparatus, including a deep bench.  Now to Trump and the Republicans today.  As we think about GOP strength, we must ask ourselves: Are we there yet?  And the answer, alas, is ""no""--at least not yet.So as we can see, there's more work to be done.  To keep our majority, we need a big majority, a growing majority, and a replenished majority.  That's how Republicans will be able to absorb the inevitable losses that come along the way.  So how to build such an enduring majority?  We'll get to that next. Next: Earning that majority. 
Did they disdain the sort of middle class Catholic voter, for example, that turned off Hillary. Did they look down on them? I think they did.  I get the feeling that a lot of it's cultural, not just economic. 

Democrats adopted a strategy . . . that excluded a hefty share of Americans and consigned many to a ""basket of deplorables"" who aren't all deplorable.  Some are hurt.  Some are confused.  Liberals miss this by being illiberal. 

Political correctness has morphed into a moral purity that may feel exhilarating but isn't remotely tactical.  It's a handmaiden to smugness and sanctimony, undermining its own goals.

Not everyone is hurting.  In the wealthy suburbs that ring Washington, D. C., people are doing just fine.  Where I work in Silicon Valley, people are doing just great.  But most Americans don't live by the beltway or the San Francisco Bay.  Most Americans haven't been part of that prosperity.  It shouldn't be surprising to see people vote for Bernie Sanders or for Donald Trump, who's the only outsider left in the race.

Donald Trump was able to capture them in terms of emotion and sentiment.  . . . Democrats have not done very well in rural America and I don't understand why that has happened. 

The broader question is how to have a Democratic Party that can attract those working men and women.

Eight years of being told I am useless.  I don't matter.  I am the past. Everything I have is due to white privilege.  I am responsible for slavery. I am racist. I am a homophobe, Islamaphobe.  I hate women and gays.

What wrongs did I do?  Go to school, get married, have children, go to Church and go to work.

We can further recall that even after that disastrous midterm result, the Republicans nevertheless remained potent; two years later, George H. W. Bush won the White House in a landslide.  So yes, the GOP was strong--but so were the Democrats, controlling, as they did, both chambers of Congress.  Politics is like that: Someone is always gaining on you, or at least, desperately trying to.  So yes, it's possible that Trump Republicans could face some tough midterms--perhaps in 2018, more likely, in 2022. So what's the answer?  There's only one answer.3. The Overprotection SolutionThere's an interesting concept from the game of chess that proves useful in politics: It's called overprotecting your position.  That is, if you're playing chess, and you're not quite sure what to do, it's almost always a good idea to build up your position in the center of the board.  That is, buttress your pawn structure with a knight, or a bishop, or a rook.That's because in chess, as in most things, the center is the most important space: It's the crossroads, it's where most of the action will be found.  Thus the injunction: Protect, even overprotect, your position, and you'll be better able to deal with whatever comes next.   And so, too, with politics.  The center is important, because that's where the most votes are.  So if a party controls the center, it will control the most votes, and thus the most political offices.Thus it's control of the center that enables a party to withstand the storm.  To illustrate this point, we might consider the Democrats of yore.  Back in the middle of the last century, Democrats were a motley crew: they had Northern liberals, and Southern conservatives; they had Catholics, Protestants, and Jews.  And while the various Democratic factions might not always have liked each other very much, they liked power more, and so they stuck together, because unity is strength. Yet even so, the Democrats went through severe political storms.  In the 1938 midterms, House Democrats lost a stunning 78 seats.  And in the 1942 midterms, they lost another 45.  Those were staggering losses!   But here's something interesting: Even after those two devastating midterms, the Democrats were still in charge.  Yes, when the 78th Congress convened in January 1943, it was House Speaker Sam Rayburn, Democrat of Texas, who was bringing down the gavel. And how did this happen?  How did the Democratic majority survive?  Answer: mathematics--the happy math of having won so many earlier elections. Here's how it went: In the early-to-mid 1930s, in response to both Herbert Hoover's Depression and Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, the House Democrats had built up a monster majority.  Crucially, while they took firm control of the House after the 1932 election, they kept going and going, adding more seats in the 1934 election--it's almost unheard of for a party to gain seats in a midterm--and then added still more during FDR's massive (46 out of 48 states) 1936 re-election.  Thus it was that in the 75th Congress, which first met in January 1937, the  Democratic majority had soared to more than 350, including allied third parties.  So that's how the Democrats could survive those deep losses in '38 and '42.  They had built themselves a big fat cushion.  Indeed, in the 62 years from 1932 to 1994, the Democrats held a majority in the House for all but four of those years.  Now that's domination!  That's the sort of political success that a party gets when it has a strong apparatus, including a deep bench.  Now to Trump and the Republicans today.  As we think about GOP strength, we must ask ourselves: Are we there yet?  And the answer, alas, is ""no""--at least not yet.So as we can see, there's more work to be done.  To keep our majority, we need a big majority, a growing majority, and a replenished majority.  That's how Republicans will be able to absorb the inevitable losses that come along the way.  So how to build such an enduring majority?  We'll get to that next. Next: Earning that majority.

Dead are Patricia Wright, 57, Charlotte Reed, 56, and 19-year-old Toto Diambu, found stabbed and shot to death in a home on November 11.Officials arrested Rivers on three counts of murder, arson, and possession of metal knuckles, according to the Sacramento Bee.Police say that after murdering the three victims, Rivers set the Oakland home on fire at about 12:30 a.m. on Friday, November 11.Rivers was discovered with a gun, ammunition, and a knife used in the murder, according to police reports.Officials offered no motive for the crime.Media outlets quickly discovered that the suspect was once named David Warfield, a teacher at Center High School in Antelope, California. In the 1990s, Warfield began to transition into a female and eventually sued the school system for discrimination.After an earlier announcement of his intention to transition into a woman, Warfield was suspended from teaching in 1999 and soon sued because of the school system's decision. Later going by the name Dana Rivers, the former teacher won a $150,000 settlement from the school system.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.SIGN UP	['Warner']	[]

But it's been clear since the first term of President Obama that some branches were more equal than others.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe big loser in the power struggle has been Congress.President Obama said he had a phone and he had a pen and he knew how and was willing to use them to accomplish things Congress would not grant him the power to do. By the end of this year, Obama will have added more than 83,000 pages of regulations to the Federal Register, the most ever in a single year. He owns seven of the 10 worst years for regulation.This penchant for seizing congressional power also is how we came to be involved in a climate deal that amounts to a payoff for undemocratic rulers around the world and how we ended up paying Iran $400 million in cash to accept a deal that gives it the power to produce nuclear weapons in less than a decade.It's high time Congress strike back and re-assert its constitutionally enshrined co-equality with the other branches. After all, it holds the power of the purse, the ability to grant presidents the power to declare war and even the power to approve key presidential appointments.And there happens to be a good opportunity to make this happen in the lame duck session, which enable retiring members to make one last mark on behalf of their institution and send a signal to the incoming Trump administration Congress will assert and protect its powers.An unlikely group, led by Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah and Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., has introduced the International Communications Privacy Act, which, according to the senators, would ""clarify U.S. law enforcement's ability to obtain electronic communications around the world.""The legislation grew out of a case in which Microsoft was ordered to turn over data to law enforcement agencies for a case they were working on. The data are located on servers in Ireland, which raised the question of whether prosecutors could compel the company to provide data that was not even stored in the United States.The government claims the Stored Communications Act compels Microsoft to produce the data, even though the data is stored in Dublin, because Microsoft's home office in Redmond, Wash., ultimately controlled the server.A federal district court judge ordered the company to produce the data in 2014, then held it in contempt of court when it refused. A U.S. Court of Appeals judge overturned that ruling, but the Department of Justice won't give up. Last month, the Department of Justice asked a federal judge to take another look at the case.No federal judge should be looking at the case again or otherwise. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act laid the ground rules for electronic communications privacy expectations, but it passed during the Reagan administration and has not kept pace with the explosion in relevant technology - for instance, the question of whether data stored in another country could be demanded by our law enforcement agencies.It needs to be updated. The balance between freedom in our own effects and the needs of law enforcement to detect some crimes before they occur should be struck by the people's representatives in Congress, not unelected judges, law enforcement officials or regulators.And lawmakers should lean toward the privacy side for a variety of reasons. For one, it's not just national secrets or secrets among criminals that cross those transoms. It's also the booming Internet consumer sales industry, which supports millions of American jobs and cannot function if its underlying data is subject to seizure by government agencies.For another, we don't want leaders of other countries demanding data held on U.S. servers to go after their political enemies.For still another, most Americans have little problem with government officials combing data to try to identify terror threats. But for routine law enforcement activities?For still another, current law allows government to access any email traffic by anyone after it is 180 days old. That's obviously a rule for another time. Today, we routinely save emails for years that we would not want to be forced to turn over to law enforcement absent a warrant.As is the case with a lot of privacy and technology law, advances in the technology have outstripped government's ability to keep up with laws that address current realities. Three senators, representing both parties, and members of both parties in the House of Representatives have joined together to create a law that represents the views of the American public on how to manage this inherent conflict between law enforcement's need to know and our right to keep our private thoughts private.It's shovel-ready legislation - already blessed by both parties. It addresses a problem that can't fairly be blamed on either party, so there is incentive to cooperate. If Congress could pass it in the lame duck, President Obama could sign it - and add a nice and likely durable piece to his legacy as well.SIGN UP"	['Trump', 'Obama']	[]

Bannon, stating on its website: ""We are not aware of any anti-Semitic statements from Bannon.""SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe statement appears at the end of an article on the ADL, ""Stephen Bannon: Five Things to Know.""The ""five things"" are:The first two claims are false. The next two claims are true, and innocuous. The final claim is exculpatory.The ADL further explains:While there is a long fact pattern of evidence that Breitbart served as a platform for a wide range of bigotry and there is some controversy related to statements from Mr. Bannon's divorce proceedings in 2007, we are not aware of any anti-Semitic statements made by Bannon himself. In fact, Jewish employees of Breitbart have challenged the characterization of him and defended him from charges of anti-Semitism. Some have pointed out that Breitbart Jerusalem was launched during his tenure.Nevertheless, Bannon essentially has established himself as the chief curator for the alt right. Under his stewardship, Breitbart has emerged as the leading source for the extreme views of a vocal minority who peddle bigotry and promote hate.The statement that ""Breitbart served as a platform for a wide range of bigotry"" is completely false, and reflects the ADL's left-wing ideological orientation rather than objective reality. The statement that Bannon is ""the chief curator for the alt right"" is also completely false, and defamatory.The ADL, which calls itself ""the nation's premier civil rights/human relations agency,"" launched a defamatory campaign on Sunday against Breitbart News and Bannon, the company's Executive Chairman, when Bannon was named Chief Strategist and Senior Counselor by President-elect Donald J. Trump. (Bannon has been on leave from Breitbart since his appointment in August as CEO of the Trump presidential campaign.)In a statement noting that the ADL ""strongly opposes"" Bannon's new White House appointment, ADL president Jonathan Greenblatt -- a former aide to President Barack Obama -- called Bannon ""a man who presided over the premier website of the Alt Right, a loose-knit group of white nationalists and unabashed anti-Semites and racists.""That is a completely false accusation.Breitbart.com is not ""the premier website of the Alt Right."" The only supposed ""alt-right"" content on the site, among tens of thousands of articles, is one widely-cited journalistic article, ""An Establishment Conservative's Guide to the Alt-Right.""As one author more familiar with the alt-right noted recently, the main alt-right sites are ""/r/altright, Stormfront, and 4chan's politics board"" -- not Breitbart News.Given the wide international interest in the presidential election, and the evident popularity of Trump among some portions of the alt-right (and unpopularity on the far-left), Breitbart has attracted wider attention beyond the company's core audience of center-right and conservative readers.But Breitbart is not an alt-right publication, and the daily news content of the website speaks for itself. Moreover, there are no ""white nationalists and unabashed anti-Semites and racists"" working at, or published by, Breitbart.On Wednesday morning, nationally syndicated talk show host Dennis Prager -- who has written a widely-respected book on antisemitism -- called the accusations against Bannon ""libel"" and said that the ADL had damaged itself with the false claims.Reacting partly to those false claims, hundreds of demonstrators gathered at the Los Angeles City Hall on Wednesday evening to stage a demonstration against Bannon, including signs referring to Bannon as a ""Nazi.""Also on Wednesday, the ADL initially denied press credentials to Breitbart News' Adelle Nazarian, who was to cover a conference on antisemitism in New York on Thursday.Nazarian, who is Jewish, is an experienced journalist who has covered antisemitism and foreign affairs for Breitbart News, and most recently covered the 2016 presidential campaign as part of the national traveling press corps.Late Wednesday, the ADL reversed its decision and credentialed Nazarian for the event.Joel B.

Trump to be Chief Strategist and Senior Counselor in the White House.""Calling Steve Bannon an antisemite is a witch-hunt ... It's just a libel, it's fabricated, the whole thing is fabricated,"" Prager said.He reminded listeners that voters had been warned in 1980 that if Ronald Reagan were elected president, the KKK would be in the White House.Prager's guest Wednesday was conservative -- and also Jewish -- writer David Horowitz, author of The Black Book of the American Left.""It's the worst witch-hunt in American history, what's going on now, and it's going to continue,"" Horowitz said.""To take a pro-Jewish defender of Israel like Steve Bannon, and -- with no evidence -- call him an antisemite is hard even to comprehend.""Horowitz said there were only two pieces of evidence used against Bannon -- one a court filing by a ""disgruntled ex-wife,"" and the other ""a headline that I wrote -- I sent an article to Breitbart unsolicited ... and they just printed what I sent ... and the headline was, 'Bill Kristol, Republican Spoiler, Renegade Jew'.""He explained that the article was written after the primary election was over and Trump was the effective nominee, and that he was attacking Kristol for effectively supporting Hillary Clinton, whom he saw as enabling the ""Jew-hating Hitlerites"" of the Iranian regime.""Hillary and Obama not only empowered Iran -- they supported the Muslim Brotherhood takeover in Egypt,"" he told Prager.""[Kristol] betrayed the Jews,"" Horowitz argued.In contrast, he said: ""What did Steve Bannon, who is Trump's chief strategist, do? They reached out Trump to call [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu and call Israel a 'beacon of hope.'""""This is the best president the Jews could wish for!"" Horowitz concluded.Prager agreed with Horowitz that the charges against Bannon were baseless -- and worse.""That's not antisemitic,"" he said, referring to Horowitz's headline. ""It has nothing to do with antisemitism, and that's what they use, plus divorce papers -- which should never be used, it's despicable,"" Prager said.Horowitz added that the media and the left were guilty of hypocrisy by obsessing over Steve Bannon while ignoring the rise of Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) to the fore of the race to lead the Democratic National Committee.""The same people who are attacking Steve Bannon are about to name, as the head of their party, a Farrakhanite, Jew-hating, racist, Muslim Brotherhood protege, Keith Ellison,"" he said.Horowitz added that Bannon's work for Trump gave him confidence in the new administration, ""because Steve will not cave.""He also praised Bannon for helping Trump take his presidential campaign to the inner cities of America, which he described as the ""Achilles heel"" of the Democratic Party.""You are living through a left-wing lie as it is hatched. It is an amazing moment to see,"" Prager said.""There is not a shred of evidence that the man is an antisemite.""He added that the episode had damaged the Anti-Defamation League, which led accusations against Bannon and Breitbart News on Sunday.Joel B.

Bannon as the Chief Strategist and Senior Counselor to President-elect Donald J. Trump.When he was named CEO of the Trump campaign in August -- taking a leave of absence from Breitbart News as he took up the post -- Bannon was hit with false and unsubstantiated accusations of antisemitism. Those allegations were recycled this week, as Bannon and Breitbart News were falsely accused of being antisemitic and racist.While the allegations are demonstrably false, they are evidently widely believed on the left, as protesters -- many of whom had apparently gathered on previous nights to demonstrate against the election results -- took up the accusations in their signs and chants.The group waved signs -- many of which were innovative, and original -- and chanted slogans. Some of the signs were profane, and even scatalogical:The demonstration was peaceful, as Los Angeles Police Department officers looked on, both at the top and bottom of the stairs. There was a smell of marijuana at one side of the demonstration.Some demonstrators wore masks. At least one waved a Mexican flag; one later hoisted a much larger American flag.Some of the protesters recognized this reporter from television, and attempted to identify him to other protesters, and to argue. Two attempted to prevent filming, and followed this reporter around the sidewalk near the demonstration.One group of protesters, raising their fists in unison, chanted: ""We refuse to accept a fascist America!""Another chant was ""We reject the President-elect!""Bannon is a former officer in the U.S. Navy, a graduate of Harvard Business School, and a successful investor, entertainment executive and filmmaker. In addition to serving as Executive Chairman of Breitbart News during several years of rapid growth and expansion at the company, he also launched Breitbart News Daily, a popular morning program on Sirius XM satellite radio's Patriot channel (125).Joel B.

Krewson did not cite any crimes that were committed at demonstrations with openly carried rifles nor did she cite any crimes committed by law-abiding citizens carrying handguns without a permit.Under Krewson's ""assault weapons"" ban, ""city residents who already own an assault weapon would have 60 days after it becomes law to dispose of the weapon or remove it from the city limits."" Once the 60 days are over, ""any assault weapon carried or possessed... would be subject to seizure and forfeiture by the city. Violating the law would carry a 90-day jail sentence and up to a $500 fine.""She did not provide details on what ""assault weapons"" are. Rather, she said they are ""military-style weapons."" She added, ""Most people don't think assault weapons are essential to self-defense or hunting."" She missed the fact that law-abiding citizens who live in Democrat-run cities -- like St. Louis -- often do believe ""assault weapons"" are great weapons to own for self-defense. They allow an outnumbered homeowner to quickly level the playing field when two or more armed home invaders kick in the front door and enter the home with evil intent.Krewson also wants to criminalize gun owners if their guns are stolen and they fail to report the theft within 48 hours. ""Failure to... report a lost or stolen gun would also be punishable by up to 90 days in jail and a fine of up to $500.""This could be problematic for gun owners who do not immediately realize their guns have been stolen or who are out of town when they are stolen.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of ""Bullets with AWR Hawkins,"" a Breitbart News podcast.

The woman confessed to being a regular panhandler who's homeless and out of work.""I'm here three days in the week,"" the woman said. She also said she didn't have a car and uses public transportation to get around.But soon after their encounter, the woman was seen getting into a car with a man.CBS2 cameras caught the woman posted up outside another shopping center holding up her sign and begging pedestrians for money.""We've seen these signs all over town. Are you guys part of some organized ring?"" Goldstein asked.""No, no, no"" the woman replied.""Are you really homeless? Are you really out of work?"" Goldstein asked.""Yes, I'm homeless,"" she said before running away once again.Goldstein's cameras caught up to another group of panhandlers, this time a mother and son begging for money outside a Walmart. When they noticed the news crew, the pair darted off and hopped into an Enterprise Rent-A-Car.""Is that right, really, to be out there asking for money? And you're driving a rental car? I mean, you're driving a 2016 new car and you're out asking for money,"" said Goldstein. Goldstein asked LAPD detective Gil Escontrias to examine the undercover footage.""It's almost to the point of being called a 'disorganized organization,' if you will, where they probably sometimes, like any type of organized theft group, will coordinate with each other as to who's going to take what position and what spot,"" said Escontrias.""For many people, this is their job,"" said Escontrias, who was once part of the Bunco Forgery Division. ""They wake up in the morning, this is what they're going to do, and they have a goal, a certain amount of money to continue with their lifestyle.""Escontrias added that for some people, panhandling ""is their work.""While it's not illegal to ask people for money, law enforcement officers like Escontrias suggest people give to a charity group instead.Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudsonSIGN UPdaysdays"	['Hudson']	[]

27	27	http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2016/11/16/cardinal-burke-threatens-formal-act-correction-pope-francis/	Cardinal Burke Threatens ‘Formal Act of Correction’ if Pope Francis Doesn’t Clarify Doctrine	"Cardinal Raymond Burke has insisted that Pope Francis must clarify serious doctrinal doubts arising from his teaching letter Amoris Laetitia, or the Cardinal will be forced to initiate ""a formal act of correction of a serious error.""SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIn September, four top Catholic cardinals including Burke wrote a private letter to Pope Francis asking him to clarify five serious doctrinal doubts proceeding from his 2016 apostolic exhortation Amoris Laetitia (The Joy of Love) concerning Holy Communion for the divorced and remarried, the indissolubility of marriage, and the proper role of conscience.When the Pope failed to reply to the Cardinals' letter, they proceeded to publish it online on Nov. 14, hoping to solicit a response.In an interview with Edward Pentin of the National Catholic Register, Burke said that although it is ""quite rare,"" Catholic tradition allows for the practice of correction of the Roman Pontiff, something that may become necessary.""But if there is no response to these questions, then I would say that it would be a question of taking a formal act of correction of a serious error,"" he said.Cardinal Raymond Burke is the former head of the Vatican's Supreme Court and patron of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. In his interview, he said that the purpose of the letter was not a political maneuver but an act of charity, unity, and pastoral concern.Burke said that the Church ""is suffering from a tremendous confusion on at least these five points"" that have to do with ""irreformable moral principles.""""So we, as cardinals, judged it our responsibility to request a clarification with regard to these questions, in order to put an end to this spread of confusion that is actually leading people into error,"" he said.Addressing the question of marriage, Burke said that the Church teaches that marriage is indissoluble and therefore, if you are divorced, ""you may not enter a marital relationship with another person unless the indissoluble bond to which you are bound is declared to be null, to be nonexistent.""Burke took the occasion to criticize the position of German Cardinal Walter Kasper, a progressive ""who holds that marriage is an ideal to which we cannot realistically hold people.""He also insisted that ""we are simply setting forth what the Church has always taught and practiced in asking these five questions that address the Church's constant teaching and practice.""""The answers to these questions provide an essential interpretative tool for Amoris Laetitia,"" he said. ""They have to be set forth publicly because so many people are saying: 'We're confused, and we don't understand why the cardinals or someone in authority doesn't speak up and help us.'""Burke also stated that the four cardinals wrote the letter ""with the greatest sense of our responsibility as bishops and cardinals,"" but also ""with the greatest respect for the Petrine Office [of the Pope], because if the Petrine Office does not uphold these fundamental principles of doctrine and discipline, then, practically speaking, division has entered into the Church, which is contrary to our very nature.""Burke further noted that as ""the chief advisers to the Pope,"" cardinals are obliged to offer him their counsel, especially on serious matters. ""For us to remain silent about these fundamental doubts, which have arisen as a result of the text of Amoris Laetitia, would, on our part, be a grave lack of charity toward the Pope and a grave lack in fulfilling the duties of our own office in the Church,"" he said.If the Pope were to teach grave error or heresy, the Cardinal said, it is the duty of cardinals and bishops ""to make clear that the Pope is teaching error and to ask him to correct it.""Follow Thomas D.

John Culberson Pulls Proposal to Bring Back Earmarks for a ‘Better Process’	"WASHINGTON, D.C.-The Texas Republican congressman, who with two other colleagues proposed a revision of the 2011 ban on legislative earmarks, withdrew his proposal at Wednesday's House Republican Conference meeting.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""Today, Speaker Paul Ryan pledged to create a transparent and accountable process to restore Congress's constitutional spending authority by the end of the first quarter of 2017,"" said Rep. John Culberson, who al0ng with Rep. Mike Rogers (R.-Ala.) and Rep. Thomas Rooney (R.-Fla.), sought a return to the practice of directing federal agencies to spend money with detailed line items -- otherwise known as earmarks.The congressman said he decided to propose the rule change because he was thwarted in his attempts to have more funding directed towards enforcing the southern border and his attempt to have the Pentagon build a missile defense facility on the East Coast. In each case, he was told that his instructions were banned as earmarks.Another example is how the federal government uses funds for dredging to support maritime commerce at the port of Long Beach, California, where the residents and voters are Democrats, yet the federal government ignores silt built up at ports in Republican parts of country, he said.The experience convinced him to end the earmark ban and put the full responsibility and authority for spending back in the Congress, as stated in the Constitution's Article 1, Section 9, he said.""You've got to be able to tell these agencies what to do,"" Culberson said.""Virtually every problem that you have seen in government is the result of unelected, unaccountable, invisible bureaucrats making decisions instead of elected officials,"" he added.The ban on earmarks is considered a crowning achievement of Speaker John A. Boehner (R.-Ohio), who worked to eliminate the practice from his first day in Congress in 1991.House Republicans are in meetings in the third week of November to vote on their leadership for the next session of Congress and their proposed rule changes. The leadership posts, such as Speaker and other officers of the chamber, and the rules do not become official until the new House membership is sworn in and the whole House votes to make them official in January.Texas Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert told reporters Wednesday before the start of the day's conference meeting that he supports the return of earmarks.Gohmert said the ban was supposed to be temporary, but has continued.While the concept of the ban sounds right, in reality the lack of budget line items and detailed instructions from Congress freed President Barack Obama and his administration to spend as they saw fit, he said.Without earmarks, Gohmert said members of Congress had to resort to official letters requesting an agency work on a specific project or priority-and those letters were ignored.""In effect, what we did was give the Obama administration sacks of money and told them to spend it however they wanted to,"" Gohmert said.Culberson told Breitbart News that Gohmert and other conservatives concerned about congressional prerogatives supported him in the conference meeting, but there needs to be a better process for lifting the ban on earmarks, so that Americans understand the conservative case for ending the ban.Ryan understood his reasons for restoring congressional control of spending, so he agreed to pull the measure that had spun up a firestorm among Capitol Hill conservatives and outside groups, he said.""My colleagues and I agreed to withdraw our amendment based on the Speaker's promise because we are confident we can develop a method to handle directed congressional spending in a way that gives constituents confidence that their hard-earned tax dollars are being spent effectively,"" he said.SIGN UP"	['Culberson', 'Long', 'Hill', 'Rooney', 'Paul', 'Gohmert', 'Obama']	[]
