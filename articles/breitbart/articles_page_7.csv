Sharpe, who compile and analyze the actuarial, budgetary, demographic, and other financial data necessary to calculate U.S. public pension plan liabilities for each state and the District of Columbia.""Pension Tracker"" is especially illuminating, because the researchers calculate pension liabilities on a ""market basis,"" to understand how many dollars that taxpayers would need to invest in 20-year risk-free Treasury Bonds at today's current yield to earn enough money to pay their pension debt; and on the ""actuarial basis"" guestimate used by state and local pension plans somehow to assume that they can earn each year by making higher-risk stock, bonds and derivative investments.""Market Basis: Pension Tracker"" estimates the public pension debt, if invested in risk-free 20-year maturity Treasury Bonds yielding a fixed yield of 2.75 percent, equals $47,388 per U.S. household -- or $17,288 for every man, woman and child in America.""Actuarial Basis: Pension Tracker"" estimates the total debt, if public pension plans earned the 7.5 percent they claim they can earn every-year-forever by taking market risks, would magically reduce the debt by 64 percent, to $11,055 per household and $4,033 for every man, woman and child.The most immediate problem with ""actuarial basis"" calculation is that no major pension plan in the 2016 fiscal year, which ended on June 30, reported making more than a 1.5 percent return. The abysmal performance followed public pension plans reporting investment gains of between 2 percent and 4 percent in 2015.With public pension plans assuming that roughly 80 cents on every dollar paid out to retirees will come from investment earnings, failing to make the 7.5 percent return goal means pension assets are paid out to retirees and the funds have less money to gamble in markets.Pension Tracker also finds an extraordinarily large impact on average ""market based"" pensions due to the debt-per-household from Alaska at $110,538; California, at $92,748 and Illinois, at $84,353.Although Illinois citizens do not have the worst household debt level, they have the worst ""market funded ratio"" (value of pension assets divided by market liability) of 21.2 percent. That compares to an average of all the 50 U.S. states and Washington D.C. that is almost twice as high, at 37.9 percent.Despite the Obama administration's shunting over $10 trillion in federal deficit spending cash to states since 2008, the Stanford report demonstrates that due to increasingly underfunded public employee pensions, the financial solvency for most states has declined substantially during the period.SIGN UP"

Rodriguez was living in a smaller city just outside New Orleans.The fight to end sanctuary city policies in the state was taken up by Landry this year with the help of Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, an immigration policy guru and lightning rod on the issue.Though state Senate Democrats gutted the sanctuary city legislation, Landry's office told Breitbart Texas months ago the fight was not over.Today, that battle is not just being had in Louisiana, but in Washington, D.C. where President-Elect Donald Trump has promised to defund cities with sanctuary city policies, with the help of Kobach.Sen. David Vitter (R-LA) has been pushing anti-sanctuary city legislation as far back as 2007, before the issue ever seen major national coverage, but has been blocked every step of the way.""During my decade-long fight to end sanctuary city policies, Senate Democrats and over 300 cities across the nation have foregone the safety of American families and communities in order to coddle and protect the 170,000 convicted criminal aliens who remain at-large in the US,"" Vitter said in a statement.""Until we end all dangerous and illegal sanctuary city policies - which I am confident will happen sooner than later - the obvious first step is to withhold federal funding from those cities refusing to comply with federal immigration laws,"" Vitter continued.Indeed, Vitter's fight against sanctuary cities will be coming in the new year when a Trump Administration is expected to not only defund cities that protect criminal illegal immigrants, but increase border security and lower the number of legal immigrants entering the country as well.Thanks to the immigration issue being at the center of Trump's campaign, Vitter's previously Democrat-blocked legislation is gaining traction.In a Los Angeles Times piece, Vitter's proposals are explained as stopping ""law enforcement funding and community development grants to states and cities that don't hold immigrants for federal immigration officials.""Additionally, that same proposal by Vitter would mandate a five to 10 year minimum prison sentence for any illegal immigrant who re-enters the country and is convicted of a felony or a drug-related misdemeanor.The Washington Post also characterized Vitter's plan as one that is keeping Democrat-controlled sanctuary cities on their toes.New Orleans, for instance, has reiterated to Breitbart Texas that it does not plan on letting up on its policies that allow federal cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), but limits officers in other ways, such as inquiring about an individuals' immigration status or aiding ICE in a local operation.John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas.

""Based on the deal, we implement our commitment.""Without mentioning Trump by name, Rouhani said that ""the world is not under the will of a single individual and party. The reality of the world will impose many things on extremists.""""Nobody should imagine it is possible to play with Iran,"" he added.The deal, which went into effect in January, forced Iran to pull back from the brink of nuclear weapons capacity in exchange for an end to many of the US and European sanctions that crippled Iran's economy.Iran has denied that the sanctions affected its economy in any way.It has been largely respected despite undiminished US-Iranian tensions throughout the Middle East, including their support for rival sides in Syria and Yemen's civil wars.Trump's exact plans on the nuclear deal are vague but any renegotiation would be difficult -- Iran has no incentive to reopen talks over a deal it is satisfied with. And none of the other countries in the seven-nation accord has expressed interest in picking apart an understanding that took more than a decade of stop-and-go diplomacy and almost two full years of negotiations to complete.Iran's supreme leader, who has final say on all state matters in Iran, said in remarks on state TV that Iran was indifferent to Trump's election victory.""We neither mourn nor cheer because it makes no difference to us. We do not have any judgment on the election,"" Khamenei said. ""We are also not worried. And we are ready for any possible incident.""""The Unites States is the same country and over the past 37 years any of the US major parties that came to power brought us no good, while their evil was always directed toward the Iranian nation,"" Khamenei added.Iran and the US have had no diplomatic relations since 1979, when militant students stormed the US Embassy in Tehran, took 52 Americans hostage and held them for 444 days after Washington refused to hand over Iran's toppled shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, for trial in Iran.SIGN UP"

Mr. Obama is unlikely to act in his final days, but the Trump Administration and new Congress could send a powerful message by passing the Taylor Force Act.The Taylor Force bill was introduced in September by Republican Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Dan Coats of Indiana and Roy Blunt of Missouri, and is named for the American army veteran who was murdered in a stabbing attack by a Palestinian terrorist while visiting Tel Aviv in March.""They will never achieve peace when you pay one of your young men to kill someone like Taylor Force. That's inconsistent and it needs to stop,"" Graham said. ""We're not going to invest in a group of people that have laws like this. It's just not a good investment.""He added that the same Palestinian law guarantees civil-service appointments for terrorists upon their release from Israeli prisons.""If you're in jail for five to six years, you come out with the civilian rank of department head or lieutenant in their security forces, you get to choose. If you're in jail 25 to 30 years, you become a deputy minister or a major general,"" Graham told the Wall Street Journal.In an earlier interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump said that he hopes to put an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict - which he referred to as ""the war that never ends"" - by striking ""the ultimate deal.""""As a deal-maker, I'd like to do... the deal that can't be made. And do it for humanity's sake,"" the president-elect said.Since the 1990s, as the U.S. and other countries have sent billions of dollars in aid to the Palestinians, Palestinian leaders have paid hundreds of millions of dollars in rewards to those who carry out bombings, stabbings and other attacks in Israel. These payments, codified in Palestinian law, are an official incentive program for murder that in any other context would be recognized as state sponsorship of terror. But the U.S. and other Western states have looked the other way while continuing to send aid, giving Palestinian leaders no incentive to stop.

Pollak appeared Wednesday morning on National Public Radio's Morning Edition with Steve Inskeep, and defended the company's Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon, while calling out NPR's ""racist programming.""SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBannon was recently named Chief Strategist and Senior Counselor by President-elect Donald Trump.Presented with selective quotes from Breitbart articles and Bannon's past statements, Pollak challenged Inskeep to defend NPR's taxpayer-funded racial programming, including Code Switch, a series that focuses obsessively on race, and which called the results of the 2016 election ""nostalgia for a whiter America.""The full audio (via NPR) and transcript follow, below.INSKEEP: Let's hear a defense of Steve Bannon. He's the campaign manager for Donald Trump, now slated for a top post at the White House -- campaign CEO, to be correct. He has been fiercely criticized because Bannon previously ran Breitbart, a website that Bannon described as ""the platform for the alt-right,"" a name that encompasses white nationalists and others embracing white identity politics.Joel Pollak has worked with Steve Bannon. He is Senior Editor-at-Large for Breitbart, and he's with us now from our studios at NPR West in Culver City, California. Good morning.POLLAK: Good morning.INSKEEP: Thanks for coming over early, really appreciate it. Now, people have heard a lot the last couple days about Bannon's statements, or statements on Breitbart. But before we get into that, I want you to round out the picture of this guy. You know him. What are people missing?POLLAK: Steve Bannon is a fantastic manager. He helped Breitbart grow fantastically, to the point where we have 250 million page views per month. He is a leader with vision, he's very disciplined, he insists on excellence from those around him. He's also very open to debate and challenge as long as you bring facts and data to the table. And he has no prejudices. He treats people equally, and in fact during my time working closely with him at Breitbart for five years, he sought out people from diverse backgrounds, and gave them a voice at Breitbart. so I --INSKEEP: Why do you -- go ahead.POLLAK: I think he's a fantastic choice. I think he's, first of all, from a conservative perspective at least, a national hero. Because in helping Donald Trump win, he's helped defend the Supreme Court and the Constitution. And I think Americans can take heart in the fact that you have someone who's so calm under pressure in the White House. You know, people tend to think of everything in political terms --INSKEEP: Let me just stop you there. Because I do want to ask about something that you said. You were talking about facts and data and how he ran Breitbart. Why did he make Breitbart ""the platform for the alt-right""?POLLAK: You know, all I can speak to is the content on the website. And the only ""alt-right"" content we have is a single article out of tens of thousands of articles, which is a journalistic article about the alt-right by Milo Yiannopoulos, and Allum Bokhari, which basically went into this movement, and tried to figure out what it was all about. [Article here] That's not racist, that's journalism.INSKEEP: Well let me ask about some articles that I have been reading. There's been a lot of mention of an article defending the Confederate flag. The headline was, ""Hoist it High and Proud."" It was put out after last year's shootings in Charleston, South Carolina. [Article here] Why was it a good idea to publish that?POLLAK: Well, there's an argument to be made -- and it was not just made at Breitbart, it was made at National Review [article here] and other places -- that the Charleston shooting had nothing to do with historical attachment to the Confedereate flag, that this was an individual who acted on his own motives, and that there was a case in terms of heritage and history. Now, that's not a case I agree with, but I don't agree with everything on Breitbart, and you don't have to agree, to work there or to enjoy the content on the website.INSKEEP: I want to mention, you know -- actually, putting controversial opinions out there is a perfectly fine idea. We've had David Duke on this program. But we fact-check. We try to question, we put in context. This particular article goes on to make a string of statements. There's a reference about President Obama and Kenya. There's also a statement: ""The Confederacy was not a callous conspiracy to enforce slavery, but a patriotic and idealistic cause."" A little bit of research would show that Alexander Stevens, the vice president of the Confederacy, declared the cause was slavery. I mean, why put these things out there?POLLAK: I think that we can talk about individual articles out of the tens of thousands at Breitbart, but, you know, NPR is taxpayer-funded, and has an entire section of its programming, a regular feature, called Code Switch, which from my perspective is a racist program. I'm looking here at the latest article, which aired on NPR, calling the election results ""nostalgia for a whiter America."" [Article here] So NPR has racial and racist programming --INSKEEP: Well, let me just mention --POLLAK: -- that I am required to pay for as a taxpayer. So, you know, you can read Breitbart, you can read something else -- I don't think that's racist, to talk about the history of the Confederate flag. There are people who disagree with that, as a symbol, but you're picking on one opinion article. Breitbart is a 24-hour news website that provides coevrage from within a conservative worldview.INSKEEP: Because we've got a limited amount of time, I do have to stop you there. We'll just check a couple of facts. Local public radio stations do receive a small percentage of their funding from the government. And Code Switch has explored race and ethnicity from a wide variety of viewpoints. And, as we've said, having a wide variety of viewpoints is fine, as long as you're checking your facts. Now, I want to ask a little bit more about what Bannon is going for, what he believes. This is a guy who's talked about nationalist movements -- I think he'd reject the label ""white nationalist,"" but he's reached out to nationalist parties in Europe, like the French National Front, which has actually been fined for racist statements. Do you have any idea of what his strategy is, what his vision is?POLLAK: I think his vision is to defend American interests. And I think you saw that reflected in some of the campaign themes that Donald Trump used, of resisting elites and resisting international agreements and international bodies that are against the American interest. There's a lot of what goes on at the United Nations, for example, which is designed to undermine American interests, and unfortunately -- from our perspective, at least -- President Obama often colluded with these international institutions, like taking the Iran Deal to the UN Security Council before taking it to Congress. That is the opposite of the way it should be. And so I think Steve Bannon's orientation, and Donald Trump's orientation, would be toward putting America first in those discussions.INSKEEP: Well, let me ask you another thing. And this is another Bannon quote -- and we can pull out quotes, but it's a quote that he made in a 2011 radio interview that gets to maybe what he wants to do inside the country? He criticized feminists. He said, ""Women that would lead this country would be pro-family, they would have husbands, they would love their children"" -- and I'm just reading the quote here -- ""they wouldn't be a bunch of dykes that came from the Seven Sisters schools."" [Article here] What's he driving at, there?POLLAK: I don't know. But there's a political correctness in this country that would say that if you said that once on a radio show, that you should be drummed out of public life. I would defy you to find a person in the LGBTQ community who has not used that term, either in an endearing sense, or in a flippant, jovial, colloquial sense. I don't think you can judge Steve Bannon's views. What you can judge him [on] is how he conducted himself at Breitbart. And he brought a gay conservative journalist like Milo Yiannopoulos on board. And Milo has brought gay conservatives into the media, into the debate. At the Republican National Convention, Breitbart co-hosted a party for gay conservatives. So that's not something you do if you're anti-gay. And Andrew Breitbart was the same. Andrew Breitbart broke through at CPAC, the conservative annual gathering, and helped GOProud get a foothold there --INSKEEP: Oh, Breitbart, that was the former publisher of Breitbart.POLLAK: Right, the founder.INSKEEP: I want to invite a yes/no question, because we've just got a few seconds here. This is a question that's just on a lot of people's minds. Is Steve Bannon -- and by extension, Donald Trump -- winking at racists? Not quite embracing their views, but trying to get their support and their votes? Yes or no?POLLAK: Absolutely not.INSKEEP: Not at all?POLLAK: Not at all.INSKEEP: OK. Joel Pollak, thank you very much, really appreciate the time.POLLAK: Good to be with you.INSKEEP: He is Senior Editor-at-Large for Breitbart News. That's a publication that was once run by Stephen Bannon, who is now slated for a senior position in President-elet Donald Trump's White House. SIGN UP"

Russia, on the other hand, has no problem with any of those actors.""They view Hezbollah positively as the errand lackey of Iran in Syria and Lebanon, (and) they are backing the Shi'ite militia activity in Iraq and Syria,"" Dichter said of Moscow.""Russia does not view Iran and its proxies according to the level of threat they pose or broadcast towards Israel,"" he said.Moscow thinks Assad should stay in power, that Iran is a stabilizing force and that the nuclear deal the United States struck with Tehran was largely positive, Dichter said. Israel views on all accounts are entirely opposite.Under President Barack Obama, the United States has largely pulled back from the Middle East, allowing Russia to exert wider influence. It remains unclear how policy will shift under Donald Trump, but the president-elect has indicated he will align U.S. policy on Syria more closely with Russia's.Dichter said Moscow had ""feelings of contempt"" towards European countries that had avoided engagement in Syria, and rather than viewing the region as an area of temporary interest, Russia was making plans for the long term.""It did not return to the Middle East with military capabilities in the air and at sea only to 'show off' and then leave,"" Dichter concluded. ""The new neighbor did not come here only to rent an apartment, he came here to build a villa.""SIGN UP"

Steve Stivers Shares Plan to Win Again in 2018, 2020	"The new chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee sat down with Breitbart News  for an exclusive interview about the lessons learned that will inform his two-year term running the political wing of the House Republicans.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""You've got to be ready for battle,"" said Ohio's Rep. Steve Stivers, who served as the deputy chairman of the NRCC. He defeated Texas' Rep.Roger Williams, when the House Republican Conference met Tuesday to elect its leadership for the next session of Congress.""Roger's a good man,"" the new chairman said of his challenger.""We had a two-minute conversation, shook each other's hand-Roger's a good man. He is a friend of mine. Roger has ideas and energy and I want to bring that to bear at NRCC and I want to figure out if there is a place, where we can put him that he feels comfortable with and that works,"" he said.""I am committed to bringing Roger into the organization as an active member,"" Stivers said. ""He's always exceeded his dues. He's always been a great member of NRCC and our conference.""Williams told Breitbart News he wants to work with the new chairman to grow and improve the NRCC.""Congratulations to Chairman Stivers,"" Williams said.We ran an exciting campaign that earned a great amount of support and I am thankful to all my colleagues who worked hard to spread our message.  I look forward to working with Chairman Stivers and Speaker Ryan on the important job of protecting and expanding our republican majority to continue to move our country in the direction of lower taxes, less government and a strong national defense.Stivers made a point of telling Breitbart News of the lessons he learned from outgoing chairman Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon. ""You've got to make the candidates ready. You've got to make sure you have the money and you've got to have the organization to win races.""Stivers said one to the most important things he learned from Walden is that it is all about winning. ""You've got to win races and he did a great job at it.""Walden took the House Republicans to their biggest majority in modern history in 2015 with 247 seats, he said.""Then, he essentially maintained it with this new class-we don't know if Sheriff Jones is a win or  lose and we're not sure-for-sure whether Darrell Issa will win, but Darrell's slightly ahead and Sheriff Jones is slightly behind, but they are still counting ballots,"" he said. Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones  challenged Rep. Ami Bera (D.-Calif.) and Rep. Darrell Issa, who represents suburban San Diego, was challenged by Democrat Doug Applegate, a retired Marine colonel.Stivers said he credits Walden with largely protecting the largest Republican majority since 1929, with only six losses, as of deadline.The Ohio congressman said his own rocky road to Congress is going to inform his chairmanship as he looks to grow his majority and protect his incumbents.""I was a candidate in 2008 in one of the most hotly contested races in country, where I lost by 2,133 votes,"" he said.""Then, I ran in 2010, in again one of the most hotly contested races in the country, and I won that race fairly comfortably, in fact we were so far ahead that the DCCC pulled out by October,"" he said. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is the political wing for House Democrats. """"I have seen what the NRCC does well, seen what they need to improve on and in consultation-talking to more than 200 of our members of our conference-have come up with a plan,"" Stivers said.The Stivers plan includes a special Patriot program for supporting incumbents in primaries, creating a national finance committee to lift the burden of fund raising off the members, recruiting a network of volunteers to staff campaigns and looking forward to the redistricting in the states to make sure Republicans are not manipulated into majority Democratic districts, he said.""We have the 2018 and 2020 cycles to win state legislatures and hold some state legislatures to make sure the map that is drawn in 2021 is as good as it can be for us,"" the congressman said. ""Frankly, that important shaping of the battlefield has to start now.""We ran an exciting campaign that earned a great amount of support and I am thankful to all my colleagues who worked hard to spread our message.

Mark Walker: Don’t Reverse Anti-Earmark Reform	"The North Carolina congressman running for the chairmanship of the Republican Study Committee tells Breitbart News he is shocked that House Republicans are lining up to bring back earmarks, the Capitol Hill slang for when congressmen and senators compel spending on particular projects.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe GOP House banned the use of earmarks in a spending reform adopted in 2011.""Donald Trump just led an historic victory, so to bring this up right now is just not the moment,"" Rep. Mark Walker (R.-N.C.), says.""This is an historic moment to have Republican control of House, Senate and presidency and I believe that the people, who came to the polls sent a clear mandate that they want change here in Washington-drain the swamp,"" he said.""We need to be talking about unifying and earmarks are another divisive issue,"" he said.Walker said down the road there could be a conversation about bringing back the practice that was formally banned by Speaker John Boehner in 2011 after more than two decades of campaigning.""Let's focus on the major things that the new Trump administration is talking about, like the repeal of Obamacare, tax reform-things we have been promising the American people, "" he said.Walker said he is running to lead the Republican Study Committee because he wants to return the RSC to the days when it presented conservative ideas and voted as a bloc to push those agenda items.The vote for RSC chairman is scheduled for Thursday and his chief opponent is Maryland's Rep. Andy Harris.Walker said his own count puts his support in the 60 to 70 vote range, but he still has to connect with congressmen, who in the middle of tough races, he was not able to make his pitch until Congress returned Monday.""We got 30 or 40 that are undecided at this point,"" he said.Members, who are supporting him, are looking to make the RSC a platform for empowering them, he said.""Conservatives want a place, where they can voice their concerns as opposed to being steamrolled sometimes, as happens around here-to be able to talk about why their issues matter,"" he said.""The RSC has been the policy think tank over the decades,"" he said. ""We have to make sure it is not a rubber stamp for just any idea, whether it comes out of the administration or if it comes out of leadership.""Walker said the RSC should not be just reacting to ideas from other sources, rather as the bloc of House conservatives, with more than 170 members, the RSC should be setting the agenda on Capitol Hill.""I believe that that is one of the ways the RSC can reclaim the mantle of conservatism,"" he said.Another function of the RSC should be preparing members for when leadership drops a surprise bill on the floor and demands quick action without time to read the bill or research its impact, Walker said.In those cases, the RSC staff should be tracking what is coming and anticipate the surprises better, he said. ""Let's  get out ahead of that.""Although it is the largest voting bloc on Capitol Hill, the Republican Study Committee does not have its weight felt as it did one decade ago, when it was smaller and when it had its own whip system for rounding up votes. Typically, less than 80 RSC members vote with other conservatives against omnibus and other stop-gap government funding legislation outside the House's regular order.One of the challenging the RSC is its own membership, with congressmen seeking membership as a badge of conservatism for voters, but not seeing it as an obligation to support the RSC's conservative agenda.Walker told Breitbart News that he recognizes that the RSC may have to get smaller to get stronger as it lets go of less committed conservatives.With just a slightly smaller membership, the RSC would be better able to focus its message and agenda, he said.""We need to be able to streamline our message of history conservative ideology,"" he said.""You have to be able to set that agenda in a way that people understand no only where you are going, but why you are going to get there.""SIGN UP"

The list includes:""Some of the names being floated as possible Secretary of Education are troubling,"" explains Jane Robbins, education fellow at American Principles Project, adding:Trump's most consistent education-related commitment during the campaign was to end Common Core and restore local control, and that won't happen if the Department of Education is run by someone who has supported or protected Common Core in the past. Mr. Trump needs to listen to the grassroots forces who are relying on him to restore local autonomy in education.""The grassroots believe Trump to be a man of his word, and they don't doubt that he would reject any candidate with a questionable track record on Common Core,"" Erin Tuttle of Indiana says.

Trump's promise to return education to local communities rests in his appointment of a Secretary of Education who truly understands the corruption and cronyism within the education reform swamp, and who has been on the front lines fighting against FedEd a.k.a. Common Core. Williamson (Bill) Evers, President-elect Trump's education transition team leader, is just that individual. I know Mr. Evers personally and was so grateful for his two testimonies before the Ohio legislature to warn of the harm of Common Core centralization and the historical success of competitive federalism.""When Donald Trump talked on the campaign trail about 'the forgotten men and women' of America, many of us who have been fighting Common Core in the trenches felt like he was talking to us,"" says Heather Crossin of Indiana, who adds that many parents have lost a voice in their children's education.""We are counting on President-elect Trump to stand up and fight for us against the powerful special interests, who not only profit off of Common Core but who pull the strings of the vast majority of politicians in both parties,"" she explains.Dr. Karen Effrem of Florida also points to Trump's promise to end Common Core and make education local once again.""Choosing pro-Common Core, establishment people like Tony Bennett, Michelle Rhee, or Eva Moskowitz would be a complete betrayal to those parents in every state who helped elect him,"" she says.While on the campaign trail, Trump said Common Core is a ""disaster"" and that Washington, D.C. should leave education to states and local school districts. Most of Trump's recent discussion about education has been in the area of school choice.Lance Izumi, director of the Center for Education at Pacific Research Institute, told Breitbart News that while school choice as a central strategy for success for all students is very positive, it should not come about with government ""strings"" attached.""Trump said that states should come up with their own formulas and programs as to how to implement choice, so it is imperative that both the federal government and the states ensure that private schools are protected from intrusive government regulations and mandates,"" he said.The Cato Institute's Neal McCluskey also told Breitbart News that school choice is ""the key to empowering parents to get the education that is best for their unique children, and for educators to teach how they want and try new, innovative approaches.""""But this is not something that should come from Washington,"" he warned, adding:The federal government has no constitutional authority to meddle in education, and as it has proven over the last several decades--including by coercing states to adopt the Common Core--once it starts paying for education it starts controlling it, telling everyone what to do and how to do it. The federal government should be withdrawn from education except in Washington, DC, itself, federal installations, and prohibiting state and local discrimination in providing education.""It is what the Constitution demands, and fifty-plus years of experience with federal spending and interference tells us is right,"" McCluskey said.Trump's most consistent education-related commitment during the campaign was to end Common Core and restore local control, and that won't happen if the Department of Education is run by someone who has supported or protected Common Core in the past. Mr. Trump needs to listen to the grassroots forces who are relying on him to restore local autonomy in education.President-elect Donald J. Trump's promise to return education to local communities rests in his appointment of a Secretary of Education who truly understands the corruption and cronyism within the education reform swamp, and who has been on the front lines fighting against FedEd a.k.a. Common Core. Williamson (Bill) Evers, President-elect Trump's education transition team leader, is just that individual.

Nevertheless, he warned Trump, ""Maybe I can't have resolutions in the Security Council but I can make their lives miserable everyday with precipitating a veto on my admission as a member state.""Meanwhile, Secretary-General of the PLO Executive Committee Saeb Erekat said he was confident that the move would not happen because ""what we heard before the elections is not what we will hear after the elections""""The American embassy will not be transferred to Jerusalem under any circumstances, as that would destroy the American interests in the Middle East, the Islamic world, and many countries around the world,"" Erekat, who also served as the Palestinian chief negotiator, said on official PA radio.In an oped for Haaretz newspaper, Erekat also claimed that Trump's win had emboldened senior government officials to express their racist sentiments more openly.The official PA daily printed a cartoon that commented on Trump's outspoken stance against immigrants, showing Trump saying: ""No to immigrants"" and an American Indian responding by picking Trump up by his collar and saying: ""Then come on, [get] out.""Meanwhile, the Palestinian Authority daily, Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, published a column on Saturday describing Trump as ""aggressive"" and ""racist.""""Forty-fifth U.S. President[-elect Donald Trump] is a most problematic man. [He is] eccentric, aggressive, racist, and rash in his responses because he is short-tempered and undiplomatic in his treatment of people, groups, and states. ... His election revealed the depth of the racist trend within the U.S.,"" Omar Hilmi Al-Ghoul wrote.Al-Ghoul added that Trump ""emphasized that he will give all support to the Israeli ethnic cleansing state.""However, in a bizarre twist, Al-Ghoul stated, ""Nonetheless, it must be objectively admitted that Trump is courageous and adventurous like no other.""Therefore, Al-Ghoul reasoned, Palestinians would do well to seek Trump's favor, noting that ""we must open a direct dialogue with him now, immediately, even before he actually takes office on Jan. 20, 2017.""Earlier in the year, the same newspaper published a cartoon featuring Trump beheading the torch of the Statue of Liberty.SIGN UP"

United States.Appointed by Bill Clinton, Aiken rejected the industry's argument that she should dismiss the case because--among other reasons--even if everyone agreed that the earth is warming and that humans are responsible, a court is still not equipped to determine what to do about it. Brushing aside those objections, the judge said that all she needed to do was ""determine what emissions level would be sufficient to"" end global warming, and then order everyone is this country to change their fossil fuel consumption accordingly.The Constitution says nothing about a fundamental right to any sort of environment--""stable"" or otherwise. Constitutional rights are given as a charter of ""negative liberties""--a series of ""thou shalt nots,"" such as saying the government shall not take away free speech, or shall not infringe religious liberty, or shall not ban gun ownership.The concept of ""affirmative rights""--that the government owes a person healthcare, or housing, or here, a particular type of environment--has been a wish list for political liberals that the courts have never embraced.The defendants can now take this matter to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

Then she turned from self-loathing to suggest, ""an army of angry mothers"" stands ready to fight against any efforts to lessen the gun control burden currently in place for law-abiding citizens.Writing in the Huffington Post, Watts referenced the December 2012 attack on Sandy Hook Elementary then suggested that ""background checks"" are a ""common sense law"" that works. She did not mention that background checks were already in place when Adam Lanza attacked Sandy Hook, but he bypassed them by stealing his guns. Nor did she mention that background checks are actually most mass public attackers' method of choice for acquiring firearms. Here is a list of attackers and alleged attackers who have purchased their guns via background checks:Yet background checks are one of the laws that Watts wants ""angry mothers"" to defend?Watts also pushed to expand background checks so that they cover private sales, treating them as retail. Hillary Clinton referred to such checks as ""comprehensive background checks,"" and they are frequently called universal background checks as well. Watts did not mention that California, Colorado, Washington state, and Paris have universal background checks, yet they have also witnessed some of the most publicized high-profile attacks of the last year.For example, three innocents were gunned down in the streets of Colorado Springs on October 31, 2015. A month later -- on November 27, 2015 -- three innocents were shot and killed at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood. The bottom line: Universal background checks were impotent to stop the attacks. On December 2, 2015, two well-armed attackers killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California. Again, universal background checks were no hindrance. On September 23, 2016, a gunman shot and killed five innocents in a Burlington, Washington, mall -- universal background checks notwithstanding.And we cannot overlook the January 7, 2015, Charlie Hebdo attack -- in which 12 were shot and killed -- or the November 13 Paris attacks, in which 130 were shot and killed. Paris's universal background checks were powerless to prevent determined attackers from carrying out their evil intentions.Yet Watts is trying to rally the troops, trying to be sure ""an army of angry mothers"" is ready to defend the very background check that Gabby Giffords's attacker passed to acquire the gun he used to injure her.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of ""Bullets with AWR Hawkins,"" a Breitbart News podcast.

And the people who work for you are also subject to those rules and norms. And that's a piece of advice that I gave to the incoming President. I am very proud of the fact that we will -- knock on wood  -- leave this administration without significant scandal.The president suggested that has considered executive options for circumventing Congress that ""have legal challenges and could make those who carried out his orders vulnerable to charges,"" notes The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), alluding to Obama's comments.Earlier this year, the Pentagon submitted a proposal to Congress outlining the Obama administration's plan to close down the military prison, which would include transferring detainees onto U.S. soil.The proposal came after the President signed legislation into law, passed with bipartisan support, that prohibits his administration from using federal funds to build or modify a facility in the United States to house Guantanamo prisoners.Obama explained to reporters:With respect to Guantanamo, it is true that I have not been able to close the darn thing because of the congressional restrictions that have been placed on us. What is also true is we have greatly reduced the population. You now have significantly less than a hundred people there. There are some additional transfers that may be taking place over the next two months...My strong belief and preference is that we would be much better off closing Gitmo, moving them to a different facility that was clearly governed by U.S. jurisdiction. We'd do it a lot cheaper and just as safely. Congress disagrees with me, and I gather that the president-elect does, as well.  We will continue to explore options for doing that.President-elect Donald Trump has declared that he would expand the population at Guantanamo Bay.The number of Gitmo prisoners has dropped from 240 to 60 under President Obama.His administration has liberated and cleared for release detainees who have been deemed to be ""forever prisoners"" or too dangerous to let go.""There is a group of very dangerous people that we have strong evidence of having been guilty of committing terrorist acts against the United States,"" acknowledged Obama on Monday, adding ""that group has always been the biggest challenge for us.""According to the most recent U.S. government data, nearly 30 percent of jihadists who are released from the prison are either confirmed or suspected of having returned to terrorist activities.One of the things you discover about being president is that there are all these rules and norms and laws, and you got [sic] to pay attention to them.

But that vote was scrubbed as some Democrats began to voice doubts about her continuing to serve in that role.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROn Tuesday, a week after Donald Trump won election to the presidency, House leadership announced that their party vote to select leaders for the next session of Congress has been postponed until after Thanksgiving.Several members of the Democrat caucus have expressed reservations about returning Pelosi to her leadership position after years of declining Democrat influence in the House of Representatives.Telling the Washington Post that there is ""angst"" in the Democrat caucus, Rep. Richard Neal (D, MA) said that Democrats may want to change their message.""To stick with the same message over four bad election cycles is a mistake,"" Neal said. ""I think part of it is that the messengers have to change.""Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton also made a statement urging his party to give more consideration to picking leadership for the upcoming session.""As we begin the 115th Congress, House Democrats must take the time to reflect on the message the American people sent us last Tuesday. Delaying the vote on leadership positions is the necessary first step to have that conversation. The American people cried out last week and we've got to listen,"" Moulton said in a statement reported by the Lowell Sun.Another Democrat told Politico that she was surprised at the level of concern among her fellows, causing the delay of the vote.""It's a big deal because I think our leadership started out today thinking it was business as usual,"" Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-OH) told Politico. ""And I think that probably not just our leadership but many people in our caucus were surprised at the level of discontent in our caucus.""Still another Democrat noted that ignoring white voters in favor of pandering to minority voting blocks doomed Democrats to lose both the White House and numerous other offices.""We think we can make up for those shrinking numbers over the past 10 years through this group or that group, and my response to that is: We should be out for everybody,"" Rep.

We can't, and the Democratic Party better wake up and understand it.""There were also reports that Pelosi was upset by the postponement of her coronation as the party's continued leader. According to Politico, ""Pelosi was described as 'very angry,' 'furious' and 'extremely defensive' by multiple sources during what was an often 'raucous' gathering.""Meanwhile, some Democrats are cautiously urging Rep. Tim Ryan (D, OH) to challenge Pelosi to a fight for her seat.Ryan's office, though, refused to confirm whether or not the Congressman is considering the move.""While he has not made any decisions about a leadership run, he strongly believes that the American people are asking for big changes and we need to figure out how best to deliver on their requests,"" Ryan spokesman Michael Zetts told The Hill.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.SIGN UP"

John Culberson, Alabama Rep. Michael Rogers, and Florida Rep. Thomas Rooney plan to end the ban on the practice by congressmen and senators of inserting specific language into legislation that directs federal agencies to spend funds on projects or items. The practice goes by the Capitol Hill slang of ""earmarks,"" and the ban was the legacy of Speaker John A. Boehner (R.-Ohio), who returned to public life in 2015.The Tea Party Patriots leader said the effort to restore earmarks raised a number of questions: ""Did they learn nothing at all from these elections? People are tired of business as usual in D.C. After this historic election, are they really going to go back to business as usual in their first votes? This is not a show of good faith; it's a show of callous cynicism and hypocrisy.""Culberson told Breitbart News that the current rules leave too much authority in the hands of the federal agencies to the detriment of the intent of Congress.""We are not repealing the earmark ban,"" the Texan said.""We are restoring the spending power that the Founding Fathers entrusted to Congress, and making the process totally transparent from start to finish. This amendment ensures that our elected officials control how our taxpayer dollars are spent and not unelected bureaucrats in the backrooms of federal agencies,"" he said.""This amendment is meant to increase transparency and responsibility, simple as that. It restores Congressional authority and brings spending into the sunshine by ensuring that the people know which member is sponsoring the request, they initiate in committee, and that the appropriation does not increase total spending for any fiscal year,"" he said.""Unelected bureaucrats are currently spending the people's hard-earned tax dollars and they are not accountable to the people, the congressman said. ""This amendment restores Congress's constitutional responsibilities.""Breitbart News made office visits to both Rogers and Rooney during business hours, but they did not respond to a request for comment before deadline.Co-founder and Chairman of the House Freedom Caucus Rep. James Jordan (R.-Ohio) told Breitbart he was not happy with the effort to undo the earmark ban.""The takeaway from last week's election is that the American people are tired of business as usual in Washington,"" Jordan said. ""That means come January, no earmarks or other special deals for special interests, period.""FreedomWorks CEO Adam Brandon said, ""It's incomprehensible that House Republicans, a week after voters sent a strong message to the Washington political establishment, would bring back earmarks - the currency of corruption.""Brandon said, ""Earmarks became synonymous with cronyism and corruption in Congress, with Members handing out funding for the politically connected, and House Republicans were right to ban the practice in the first place.""FreedomWorks, which is a Washington-based logistics and policy hub for Tea Party and other conservatives activists, was a part of the efforts to ban earmarks in previous Congresses.""We hope that the House Republican Conference will reject this proposal to bring back earmarks and pursue a bold conservative agenda that reflects the will of conservative grassroots activists and voters,"" Brandon said.Club for Growth president David McIntosh said he is strongly against the return of earmarks.""This is a test of whether Republicans are listening to the American people, he said.""It's been barely a week since voters sent a resounding rejection of Washington insider politics, and yet House Republicans are already on the verge of proving they're tone deaf,"" he said.""Earmarks represent the worst of inside-the-beltway gamesmanship, by enticing Members to vote for big-government bills with the lure of getting tax dollars for big projects back in their districts,"" he said.""House Republicans banned earmarks in 2011, but some have been trying to get back their spending power ever since. Voters believed that Republicans would 'drain the swamp,' not redirect it for their own benefit. Any effort to restore this kind of cronyism should be flatly rejected,"" McIntosh said.SIGN UP"

DiNardo was one of 13 cardinals to sign a letter to Pope Francis in October 2015 raising several objections about left-wing manipulation of the controversial synod on marriage and family life.Although the signers of the letter said they were taking up the Pope's invitation for frank debate, many saw the move as a rebuke of the way Francis organized the synod.As Vice President of the Conference, the bishops elected another conservative, Los Angeles Archbishop Jose Gomez, a member of Opus Dei. Together with Archbishop Charles Chaput of Philadelphia, Gomez was passed over by Pope Francis in the recent selection of new U.S. cardinals, despite his impressive resume and the importance of Los Angeles as an archdiocese.Instead, Francis named the recently appointed archbishop of Chicago, Blaise Cupich, a man with impeccable liberal credentials. He also broke with protocol by choosing Archbishop William Tobin of Indianapolis, a relatively small archdiocese, and then moved him to the archdiocese of Newark. Both men will be made cardinals in the Vatican this weekend at a meeting called a consistory.Veteran Vatican analyst John Allen noted that with his new appointments, Pope Francis had engineered a ""seismic shift"" in the Catholic hierarchy in the United States, and by naming just progressives, ""Francis was making a statement about the direction in which he wants the American church to go.""For his part, Indianapolis Archbishop William Tobin has also been critical of America's culture wars and publicly clashed with Vice President-elect Mike Pence over the idea of welcoming Syrian refugees into the Archdiocese of Indianapolis.Archbishop DiNardo has said he views American society as growing increasingly intolerant toward religion and has found the Obama administration ""coercive"" in its attempts to restrict religious liberty.As a strong supporter of the pro-life movement, DiNardo's appointment signals that the bishops' conference will continue its emphasis on the right to life and religious freedom in the U.S.Follow Thomas D.
