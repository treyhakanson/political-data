Not only did he not do so (and I was present at all times) but it was she that was the one being flirtatious,"" Anthony Gilberthorpe said in a note provided to The Post by the Trump campaign.In an exclusive interview arranged by the campaign, Gilberthorpe said he was on the flight -- in either 1980 or 1981-- where Jessica Leeds claimed Trump groped her.Read the rest of the article here.SIGN UP"

The AR-15 used in the Sandy Hook attack was legally made and was sold and registered to Nancy Lanza, Adam's mother. He stole that gun from her, then shot and killed her before going to the school.The suit against Remington was filed in October 2014. BBC News reported that court documents in the filing said, ""There is one tragically predictable civilian activity in which the AR-15 reigns supreme: mass shootings. Time and again, mentally unstable individuals and criminals have acquired the AR-15 with ease, and they have unleashed the rifle's lethal power into our streets.""A couple of points need to be made. First, AR-15s by no mean reign supreme in ""mass shootings."" As with other crimes, handguns are by far the weapon of choice and shotguns are popular as well. In fact, the key component to ""mass shootings"" is not the type of gun used but the location of the shooting, which is predominately a gun-free zone. Secondly, Lanza did not acquire an AR-15 with ""ease""-rather, he had to steal it.During the Democrat primary Bernie Sanders said that Sandy Hook families ought not be able to sue Remington for the illegal use of a gun that was acquired through thievery. The New York Daily News questioned Sanders on this point:NY Daily News asked, ""There's a case currently waiting to be ruled on in Connecticut. The victims of the Sandy Hook massacre are looking to have the right to sue for damages the manufacturers of the weapons. Do you think that that is something that should be expanded?""Sanders responded, ""Do I think the victims of a crime with a gun should be able to sue the manufacturer, is that your question?""The NY Daily News said, ""Correct.""Sanders replied, ""No, I don't.""AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

Other people that are a little worried to speak out because of possible persecution.""CBS 19 reports that Parks was openly and legally carrying a firearm and that he was later joined by another Trump supporter who was carrying a firearm as well.Dittmar volunteer, Su Wolff, was bothered by how long Parks stood outside the office. She said, ""If he wants to support his candidate that's fine, but don't come here and stare into the office all day."" She was also bothered that Parks' gun was visible whenever his side was turned toward people walking past or toward him.Candidate Dittmar took to Facebook over the Trump supporters, writing:We'd like you to be aware of a situation at our Fluvanna County campaign office.

Strassel notes that although ""the nation now has proof of pretty much everything [Hillary Clinton] has been accused of,"" the media ""has almost uniformly ignored the flurry of bombshells, preferring to devote its front pages"" to the story that Donald Trump ""made lewd remarks a decade ago and now stands accused of groping women.""SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER From Strassel in the Wall Street Journal:The Obama administration--the federal government, supported by tax dollars--was working as an extension of the Clinton campaign. The State Department coordinated with her staff in responding to the email scandal, and the Justice Department kept her team informed about developments in the court case.Worse, Mrs. Clinton's State Department, as documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show, took special care of donors to the Clinton Foundation. In a series of 2010 emails, a senior aide to Mrs. Clinton asked a foundation official to let her know which groups offering assistance with the Haitian earthquake relief were ""FOB"" (Friends of Bill) or ""WJC VIPs"" (William Jefferson Clinton VIPs). Those who made the cut appear to have been teed up for contracts. Those who weren't? Routed to a standard government website.The leaks show that the foundation was indeed the nexus of influence and money. The head of the Clinton Health Access Initiative, Ira Magaziner, suggested in a 2011 email that Bill Clinton call Sheikh Mohammed of Saudi Arabia to thank him for offering the use of a plane. In response, a top Clinton Foundation official wrote: ""Unless Sheikh Mo has sent us a $6 million check, this sounds crazy to do.""...The leaks also show that the press is in Mrs. Clinton's pocket. Donna Brazile, a former Clinton staffer and a TV pundit, sent the exact wording of a coming CNN town hall question to the campaign in advance of the event. Other media allowed the Clinton camp to veto which quotes they used from interviews, worked to maximize her press events and offered campaign advice.Read the rest here. SIGN UP"

Clinton and her GOP rival Donald J. Trump, according to the WBUR-FM poll conducted Oct. 10 through Oct. 12 with 501 of the state's likely voters.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERClinton is the choice of 41 percent to Trump's 38 percent, after undecided respondents were pressed to make a decision with Libertarian Gary Johnson, 11 percent, and Green Party nominee Dr. Jill Stein, three percent, according to the poll's executive summary. The poll carries a 4.4 percent margin of error with a 95 percent level of confidence.In the initial questioning, the numbers were the same, except Trump was at 37 percent, which suggests that undecideds may be shy Trump supporters.WBUR-FM's previous poll, conducted Sept. 27 through Sept. 29, showed Clinton ahead of Trump with 42 percent to Trump's 35 percent.In the 2012 presidential election, President Barack Obama won New Hampshire with 52 percent of the vote over W. Mitt Romney, his Republican rival.Another positive sign for the Trump campaign was the speech given by First Lady Michelle Obama Thursday in Manchester.The speech was celebrated in the left-wing media as a stinging rebuke of Trump from Obama's wife when she criticized the New York City developer for his relationships with women.But, in the closing weeks of the campaign, sending FLOTUS anywhere is calculated.In August, Gallup polling showed that the first lady had the highest favorables of anyone in the presidential group of candidates, spouses, or in the current administration, with 64 percent of respondents having a favorable opinion and 32 percent with an unfavorable opinion.In fact, of all the ""presidential"" personalities, the president's wife is considered not only the most popular, but also the least politically-sensitive or overtly political, when she speaks. Much of this is a function of her being less politically engaged.Thus, the decision to ""engage"" the first lady is not a light one.Bottom line: Michelle Obama's speech against Trump was important, but it could have been given anywhere. If the Clinton campaign sent her to New Hampshire, rather than any other place in the country, they are signalling that New Hampshire is absolutely in play for Trump.SIGN UP"

I'm a pro-military, pro-equal pay, pro-Second Amendment, pro-immigration, and pro-business Hispanic woman voting for Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton is not a strong leader. Blindly voting for Clinton because she happens to be a woman does not prove feminist bonafides. For me, it would go against everything my husband and I have stood for: love of family, strength of our local community, and defense of our country.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERI have seen my husband get dragged through the mud and called every name in the book by cowards on Twitter and in the opinion pages. I've been criticized myself by the left because they cannot comprehend or respect a woman choosing to vote for Mr. Trump. Because I choose to reject the decades of lies and corruption of Hillary Clinton and her husband's sordid past, I've been called uneducated, (I have a law degree by the way), a puppet (I actually urged Ryan to support Trump), a disgrace to women, and so many more things that are not fit to print. The intolerance of the modern Democratic Party is a far cry from the Democratic Party I used to support as an independent voter.Let me tell you why I do support Mr. Trump. I'm a wife, daughter, mom and grandma, and I love our country. Like our daughter and granddaughters, I care about what is going on around the world. When Ryan was deployed commanding troops in war, it was my job to keep morale up at home. Navy SEALs are more than colleagues, they are brothers. We are family. When Ty and Glenn died in Benghazi it shook our family. When Hillary Clinton lied about it, it was a slap in the face. When she criticized families for calling her out in it, it was un-American. As a military wife and mom, I will never support somebody who does not support the military.Everyone knows my husband was a Navy SEAL for 23 years. I also have a daughter who is a Navy Diver and my son in law is an active duty SEAL. My youngest son is considering military service as well. Hillary Clinton will continue the dangerous foreign policy she and President Obama started and she will continue to put out troops in harms way with no plan. This will open us up to more casualties abroad and more terrorist attacks at home.I'm a small business woman. I am also the mom of two college students who are about to face an economy that under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton doesn't have jobs for them. Nearly 13 percent - that's the unemployment rate for millennials. Taxes, regulations, and economic conditions are important. I believe Trump's business acumen will help build a stronger economy and he will surround himself with incredibly smart and successful individuals rather than career bureaucrats.We all know Mr. Trump has said some regrettable things. He's since apologized. I got over it. With everything that is going on in the world - Iran and North Korea flexing nuclear muscle, terrorist attacks in America, high unemployment with millennials - I think this election is about more than locker room talk.Lolita Zinke is a small business woman, wife of Congressman Ryan Zinke, and a volunteer member on Donald J.

It addressed deficiencies in the Clinton Foundation's structure and oversight, including the potential for conflicts of interest due to the Hillary Clinton's role as Secretary of State.The auditors noted that ""some interviewees reported conflicts of those raising funds or donors, some of whom may have an expectation of quid pro quo benefits in return for gifts."" They also flagged a potential problem in the charity's IRS filing:... the IRS Form 990, which is signed under penalties of perjury and is publicly available, asks (a) whether the Foundation has a written conflict-of-interest policy, (ii) whether directors, officers, and key employees are required to annually disclose interests that could give rise to conflicts of interest, and (iii) whether the Foundation regularly and consistently monitors and enforces compliance with its conflict-of- interest policy. The Foundation indicated on its 2010 Form 990 that it has a written conflict-of- interest policy, requires annual disclosure of potential conflicts of interest, and monitors and enforces compliance with the policy. However, we did not find evidence of that enforcement.The auditors concluded with a recommendation (original emphasis): We recommend that the Foundation establish a gift acceptance policy and procedures to ensure that all donors are properly vetted and that no inappropriate quid pro quos are offered to donors in return for contributions.However, a report compiled in August 2013 on the internal review, published on the Clinton Foundation's website, implies that the new gift acceptance policy and procedures had not yet been adopted. Hillary Clinton had already left the State Department earlier that year.Other problems with the Clinton Foundation at the time included that its board did not have a chair, and was not very involved in running the charity.

Vermont is also one of only seven states where write-in candidates are completely allowed and counted as equal to the actual candidates (along with New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Iowa).That means Sanders threatens to peel off Vermont's three electoral votes in the same way that Trump could pick up an electoral vote in Maine's second district, where he is leading big league.In September 2012, this reporter wrote of ""The Northern Strategy,"" a concerted effort by Northeastern conservatives to shore up electoral support on the Senate, House, and gubernatorial level in the aftermath of Scott Brown's historic 2010 Senate victory in Massachusetts. Brown is a strong Trump supporter.Trump's campaign stop at Sacred Heart University in Connecticut shortly before Steve Bannon's hiring as campaign CEO was notable for its attacks on the Monica Lewinsky scandal and for Trump's Ross Perot-style poster props.Breitbart News reported from Manchester, New Hampshire the night of Sanders' New Hampshire primary win:With 4.7 percent of the precincts reporting, Sanders had 7,548 votes (53.3 percent) to Clinton's 6,315 (44.6 percent).Sanders' win was fueled by a massive turnout by independent voters and non-Democrats.41 percent of Democrat voters were independents and only 55 percent were registered Democrats......The line was out the door at Sanders headquarters at Concord High School in Concord, New Hampshire prior to the announcement....Clinton's loss comes just one year after she led Sanders by 56 points in the polls. Sanders is now the first Jewish candidate to win a major presidential primary.What happened?Clinton suffered bad optical defeats here in recent days. There was the rally where Bill Clinton's Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that women have a ""special place in Hell"" if they don't support fellow woman Hillary Clinton. There was the remarkableFreudian slip by aging feminist Gloria Steinem, a Clinton supporter, who said that young women gravitate toward Bernie in order to meet ""boys.""The leftist uproar was swift and devastating. Clinton surrogate and Massachusetts state treasurer Deb Goldberg even hopped on a Clinton conference call to demand that the campaign make sure that Albright and Steinem are ""kept away"" in the future.How jarring all this must be for the Clintons.In the debates as in her awkward interview with Black Lives Matter protesters, Clinton resorts to dredging up the feminist victories of her past. She was, after all, a Vietnam-era radical, a Wellesley College campus idealist. As First Lady she went to China and gave a speech at a pro-woman summit in 1995 that featured a tent devoted to the cause of lesbianism. Doesn't anyone remember? Her campaign is selling T-shirts about it in its online store.Bill Clinton, as he did against Obama in 2008, stumped around New Hampshire to dwindling crowds railing against Sanders. How dare Bernie supporters attack his friend Joan Walsh, the Salon editor, another relic of his bygone decade?""She and other people who have gone online to defend Hillary and explain -- just explain -- why they supported her have been subject to vicious trolling and attacks that are literally too profane often -- not to mention sexist -- to repeat,"" Bill Clinton said.The progressives didn't buy it. Internet social justice warriors don't respect campus legacies. They just wonder why ""New Democrat"" Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act and didn't do anything about mass black incarceration. An entire progressive movement happened while the Clintons were palling around with Goldman Sachs. And the new movement is hostile to anything in American culture that came before it.The cultural Left is done with the Clintons. As evidenced by Sanders' cameo opposite Larry David on the last Saturday Night Live, Bernie is the new Obama. Even Chelsea Clinton slipped up and referred to Bernie as ""President Sanders.""Cachet, at least in politics, can only be gained once. And even if the Clintons manage to win the delegate count against Bernie in the end, they've lost a commodity that can never, ever be returned. With 4.7 percent of the precincts reporting, Sanders had 7,548 votes (53.3 percent) to Clinton's 6,315 (44.6 percent).
Sanders' win was fueled by a massive turnout by independent voters and non-Democrats.
41 percent of Democrat voters were independents and only 55 percent were registered Democrats...
...The line was out the door at Sanders headquarters at Concord High School in Concord, New Hampshire prior to the announcement.
...Clinton's loss comes just one year after she led Sanders by 56 points in the polls. Sanders is now the first Jewish candidate to win a major presidential primary.
What happened?
Clinton suffered bad optical defeats here in recent days. There was the rally where Bill Clinton's Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that women have a ""special place in Hell"" if they don't support fellow woman Hillary Clinton. There was the remarkableFreudian slip by aging feminist Gloria Steinem, a Clinton supporter, who said that young women gravitate toward Bernie in order to meet ""boys.""
The leftist uproar was swift and devastating. Clinton surrogate and Massachusetts state treasurer Deb Goldberg even hopped on a Clinton conference call to demand that the campaign make sure that Albright and Steinem are ""kept away"" in the future.
How jarring all this must be for the Clintons.
In the debates as in her awkward interview with Black Lives Matter protesters, Clinton resorts to dredging up the feminist victories of her past. She was, after all, a Vietnam-era radical, a Wellesley College campus idealist. As First Lady she went to China and gave a speech at a pro-woman summit in 1995 that featured a tent devoted to the cause of lesbianism. Doesn't anyone remember? Her campaign is selling T-shirts about it in its online store.
Bill Clinton, as he did against Obama in 2008, stumped around New Hampshire to dwindling crowds railing against Sanders. How dare Bernie supporters attack his friend Joan Walsh, the Salon editor, another relic of his bygone decade?
""She and other people who have gone online to defend Hillary and explain -- just explain -- why they supported her have been subject to vicious trolling and attacks that are literally too profane often -- not to mention sexist -- to repeat,"" Bill Clinton said.
The progressives didn't buy it. Internet social justice warriors don't respect campus legacies. They just wonder why ""New Democrat"" Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act and didn't do anything about mass black incarceration. An entire progressive movement happened while the Clintons were palling around with Goldman Sachs. And the new movement is hostile to anything in American culture that came before it.
The cultural Left is done with the Clintons. As evidenced by Sanders' cameo opposite Larry David on the last Saturday Night Live, Bernie is the new Obama. Even Chelsea Clinton slipped up and referred to Bernie as ""President Sanders.""
Cachet, at least in politics, can only be gained once. And even if the Clintons manage to win the delegate count against Bernie in the end, they've lost a commodity that can never, ever be returned.SIGN UP"

Anthony Weiner (D-NY).Allred has targeted Republicans frequently in past election years with similar press conferences, including Meg Whitman, who ran for governor in California in 2010, and whom Allred accused of abusing a domestic employee who was in the country illegally.It is not clear why Zervos would have needed to use Allred to present her allegations, which concern Trump's behavior on the set of The Apprentice, the reality television show Trump hosted and on which Zervos was a contestant.It is also unclear whether Allred can distinguish in this case between her role as a lawyer, and her role as a political operative -- and elected delegate -- on behalf of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.Federal Election Commission records indicate that Allred also gave Clinton a $2700 contribution, the maximum allowable individual amount.Joel B.

The most recent insurers to quit Obamacare were Aetna and UnitedHealth Group, both which announced they were abandoning Obamacare this year.Aetna, for instance, announced it had lost $300 million in 2015 alone.Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini also pointedly noted that Obamacare lacks honesty in how customers are informed about the way insurance really works.The massive changes will cause costs to rise up to fifty percent next year for those who have not lost their plans, and will also likely leave customers with fewer plans to choose from at costs that are much higher than they currently are. In addition, many doctors and hospitals will no longer be included in the networks for the lower-end plans.The losses will mostly affect individuals who have purchased their insurance plans through the Obamacare exchanges, instead of receiving their coverage from their employers.According to its review, Bloomberg found that nearly 100,000 customers per state will lose insurance in Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Tennessee. Closer to 300,000 in North Carolina will lose coverage, and more than 400,000 will be dumped from plans in Florida.The warnings that Obamacare is on the verge of collapse have been sounding for several years. A recent Kaiser Family Foundation study on Obamacare was released that was such bad news for Obamacare it brought the Trump campaign to call it ""another extraordinary indictment of Obamacare.""Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.SIGN UP"

""Now, I pled to that law because I provided, I was sort of the other side of the transaction that Hillary and her folks are on.

But from what I've read and what I've seen, it seems very clear to me that what they were doing is, in essence, selling the assets of the people, the federal government, for contributions to the Clinton Foundation,"" he said. ""To me, this was classic honest services fraud, where you had - it's not bribery, obviously. Bribery is very difficult to define in U.S. law, statutorily. It is a standard that is usually too high to meet - but what, in essence, was going on there is that the Foundation team was soliciting contributions at the same time as facilitating access to our public servants, to the secretary of state and her staff, and in some cases getting results, and in some cases not getting results, but that does not matter. In essence, what the result is, is the access,"" Abramoff explained.When Boyle mentioned the abnormally high percentage of meetings Secretary of State Clinton gave to Clinton Foundation donors, Abramoff interjected that ""my point is, even if one of them is with a Clinton Foundation donor, if somebody gave money to the Clinton Foundation, and the quid pro quo was getting a meeting, or getting a phone call returned, that gets you into that area.""""What puzzles me is that Director Comey of the FBI - I mean, this is the same FBI that investigated me, and properly referred charges to the Justice Department that filed charges against me for these things,"" Abramoff said.

""I'm not necessarily saying, in these remarks, anything other than the fact that I think it's unjust to our justice system to watch this happen. When people are out there thinking about committing a crime, they now can think, 'Well, if Hillary gets away with it, and Bill gets away with it, maybe I can get away with it,' and that undermines our society far worse than, God forbid, the election of Hillary to the presidency.""Abramoff said that while he's obviously not involved in the FBI's deliberations, ""I can't for the life of me imagine the conversation at the FBI, in terms of referring criminal charges to the Justice Department, why Director Comey and others would conclude that no prosecutor would bring charges against her.""""I think it's astonishing,"" he said.

Because the fact is, as soon as you lie to an investigator, you've sort of fallen into that area.""""I can't for the life of me understand it, other than to conclude that there was a political decision made here, and that is extremely dangerous,"" Abramoff said.

We all knew - nobody thought, and I would go around in the interviews I was doing at the time, saying Hillary will either be nominated or prosecuted, and I don't for the life of me believe she'll be prosecuted because the Obama administration is extremely political. If they were a Republican administration acting like this, they would be considered worse than whatever Nixon was trying to pull off, in those days.""

She mentioned the detail in her 1995 book, ""Passion and Betrayal.""In our interview, Flowers, the former local news reporter and singer, provided new details about what she says was the abortion experience, including Bill Clinton's alleged involvement in helping her get through the process.She stated:""Interesting story. I was a news reporter at the time. I also had a little show, a little for your information show and I had on the lady who was running the abortion clinic because needless to say it was very controversial in town. And I had had her on my show. Well, little did I know at that very moment I was actually pregnant. Well that was in 1977. And I found out later after that interview. And I told her, you know, to arrange something hopefully that was sort of private.""But yes, I told him (Bill Clinton). And deep down I wanted to hear him say okay well I'm going to get a divorce and we'll have this baby and everything is going to be fine. And the first words out of his mouth were, 'Well you know I will pay for an abortion.'""And of course my heart sunk. And then the reality you know hit me right in the face. That he was married and he was going to stay married. And that's the way it was. So I thought fine. I wasn't prepared to have a baby and raise it on my own so I decided to go ahead and have the abortion.""Flowers recounted what she said were the emotional and physical effects of the abortion:""It was not only physically painful but it was very psychologically painful. Because I love him. And it was really psychologically a horrible thing to go through. I remember after the procedure was done I went into a room. I was sitting there and I just started sobbing and it seemed like the subs came from my stomach and up. It was the deepest sobs that I've ever done. And anyway like I said it was a horrible experience in every way.""...When I drove into the clinic there were protesters. And I was afraid somebody was going to recognize me as a news reporter. And anyway, got inside and then at a point you know I had the procedure. And I was able to be alone in a room.""She said Clinton paid $200 for the abortion procedure.I asked whether she was certain that the baby was his.""Absolutely,"" she replied. ""Which I find amusing when I hear the stories that Bill supposedly can't have kids. To that point he and Hillary didn't have any children. Didn't have Chelsea yet. And he had told me that he didn't think that he could have kids. And that was why I was more casual with birth control then I would have been normally.""Flowers said that Clinton was emotionally there for her afterwards. ""He was very sweet,"" she said. ""And gentle. And seemed very sorry that I had gone through what I had. I don't think that he would have changed his mind. But he sincerely seemed to have sympathy and like I said and also cared about the physical pain as well.""Abortion services were available at a select few locations in Arkansas at the time.In 1977, Arkansas added an amendment to its constitution to prohibit the use of state funds to pay for abortion services.  In 1978, the Harvard Crimson reported the minimum price for an abortion that year, at least in Massachusetts, was $150.Meanwhile, Flowers stated that Hillary ""absolutely"" knew about the alleged affair as early as 1977, when Flowers says the affair began.""I know she did because there was a security guard at the mansion. Back then we didn't have cell phones. So he (Bill Clinton) would have key people - whether it be Betsy Wright or a security guard at the mansion - for me to call and ask for and then that person would get a message to him to call me back.""And one day he came in and the security guard told him that I had called and gave him the message. And what he didn't know was that she (Hillary) was actually there and was walking up to meet him and heard the guard say my name. And that I had called. And so she had a conversation with him a little bit later that she was getting real tired of hearing that name. And that she wanted it to stop. And he told her it wasn't gonna stop. And she said, 'Well, Just at least don't embarrass me.' Well of course he went on to embarrass her. Many, many times.""They had only been married about three months when he and I started our affair. You know, they didn't have Chelsea. It started early on in their relationship as well.""Flowers never sought to go public. Her name was put out there against her will when former Clinton insider Larry Nichols, who claimed he was improperly dismissed by Clinton from a state job, mentioned Flowers in court documents. In a lawsuit, Nichols alleged that Clinton diverted state funds to engage in extramarital affairs with five women, and he named Flowers, and four others, including former Miss America Elizabeth Ward Gracen and former Miss Arkansas Lencola Sullivan.Nichols would later drop his lawsuit, but the charges helped form the basis for tabloid stories alleging that Clinton had extramarital affairs, including with Flowers.Three days after Star Magazine mentioned Flowers as Clinton's alleged mistress, Bill and Hillary Clinton appeared in January 1992 side by side on ""60 Minutes,"" where Bill denied a relationship with FlowersTo protect her reputation, Flowers held a press conference the next day where she played excerpts from tape recordings she had made of private phone calls with Clinton. In a deposition in 1998, Bill Clinton admitted he had a sexual encounter with Flowers.Aaron Klein is Breitbart's Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

But Abedin warned that Hillary Clinton would not be pleased, particularly after learning that Podesta was involved in getting the speech canceled.""HRC very strongly did not want him to cancel that particular speech,"" she said. ""I will have to tell her that WJC chose to cancel it, not that we asked.""Mook argued that it would be a political risk, saying that Clinton's speech would be ""begging for a bad rollout.""""I would suggest that if she is determined to keep this speech that she talk with John because this is a very big deal in my view,"" he wrote.He continued:I know this is not the answer she wants, but I feel very strongly that doing the speech is a mistake-the data are very clear on the potential consequences. It will be three days after she's announced and on her first day in Iowa, where caucus goes have a sharply more negative view of Wall Street than the rest of the electorate. Wall Street ranks first for Iowans among a list of institutions that ""take advantage of every day Americans"", scoring twice as high as the general election electorate. I recognize the sacrifice and dissapointment (sic) that cancelling (sic) will create, but it's a very consequential unforced error and could plague us in stories for months. People would (rightfully) ask how we let it happen.A half an hour later, Abedin emailed to note that Clinton finally agreed to cancel.""Just raised with her again. We are good to cancel esp if WJC is ok with it,"" she wrote. ""Just needed a cool down period.""SIGN UP"

The group in July said it had cut ties to al Qaeda and changed its name to Jabhat Fatah al-Sham. ANOTHER TRY AT DIPLOMACYThe U.S. and Russian foreign ministers will meet in Lausanne, Switzerland on Saturday to resume their failed effort to find a diplomatic solution, possibly joined by their counterparts from Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Iran, butU.S. officials voiced little hope for success.Friday's planned meeting at the White House and the session in Lausanne occur as Obama, with just 100 days left in office, faces other decisions about whether to deepen U.S. military involvement in the Middle East -- notably in Yemen and Iraq -- a stance he opposed when he won the White House in 2008.Earlier Thursday the United States launched cruise missiles at three coastal radar sites in areas of Yemen controlled by Iran-aligned Houthi forces, retaliating after failed missile attacks this week on a U.S. Navy destroyer, U.S. officials said.In Iraq, U.S. officials are debating whether government forces will need more U.S. support both during and after their campaign to retake Mosul, Islamic State's de facto capital in the country.Some officials argue the Iraqis now cannot retake the city without significant help from Kurdish peshmerga forces, as well as Sunni and Shi'ite militias, and that their participation could trigger religious and ethnic conflict in the city.In Syria, Washington has turned to the question of whether to take military action after its latest effort to broker a truce with Russia collapsed last month.The United States has called for Assad to step down, but for years has seemed resigned to his remaining in control of parts of the country as it prosecutes a separate fight against Islamic State militants in Syria and in Iraq.The U.S. policy is to target Islamic State first, a decision that has opened it to charges that it is doing nothing to prevent the humanitarian catastrophe in Syria and particularly in Aleppo, Syria's largest city.Renewed bombing of rebel-held eastern Aleppo has killed more than 150 people this week, rescue workers said, as Syria intensifies its Russian-backed offensive to take the whole city.Anthony Cordesman of Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank suggested the United States' failure to act earlier in Syria, and in Aleppo in particular, had narrowed Obama's options.""There is only so long you can ignore your options before you don't have any,"" Cordesman said.SIGN UP"
