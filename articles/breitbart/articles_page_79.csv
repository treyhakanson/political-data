Hillary Clinton sees ""implicit bias"" not just in the police force, but in ""everyone in the United States,"" Pence declared.Liberals cannot brook criticism of their precious ""implicit bias"" theory, which is a new rationalization for totalitarian power, for rule by the progressive Elect whose Ivy League training has equipped them to sniff out the witch of hidden racism.At Slate, William Saletan tried patronizing Pence with a ""Dear white people, we need to have a talk"" article, urging people of pallor to just relax and accept that they suffer from a psychic disease Doctor Government can treat, but never truly cure:Every day, in one city or another, black and brown parents sit their kids down and talk to them about bias. They explain that at some point, based on the color of your skin, you might be suspected of doing something wrong. Don't go to certain places, don't wear certain clothes, and don't move in any way that might be construed as a threat. Play it safe.White people don't have to talk to our kids this way, because our color doesn't attract suspicion. We need to have a different talk, not about suffering implicit bias but about practicing it.Here's the first ground rule: ""Implicit bias"" isn't an accusation. It doesn't mean you're bad. It means you're normal. Animals prejudge one another based on appearance. Human beings are naturally tribal. So implicit bias, as a disposition, isn't something you learn. It's something you learn to overcome.Here's the second rule: When somebody brings up implicit bias, don't freak out. Don't get defensive and shut down the discussion.To his credit, Saletan chastises liberals, and even Hillary Clinton in particular, for throwing around baseless accusations of racism, alienating large numbers of people by calling them ""irredeemable"" occupants of a ""basket of deplorables.""But then he explains that implicit bias is the kinder, gentler version of the systemic-racism argument, and we're not supposed to question it, because we are absolved of conscious guilt. We don't even realize how biased we are - it's something only the credentialed elites of the Ruling Class can perceive with clarity:But ""implicit bias"" is the opposite of ""deplorable."" The whole point of the theory of implicit bias--the reason why it can fairly be attributed to everyone--is that it's not an accusation of guilt or bigotry. It's an acknowledgment of the human condition.There's way too much research on implicit bias to deny its existence. And there are way too many cases that illustrate it. In Tuesday's debate, moderator Elaine Quijano mentioned Sen. Tim Scott, a black Republican who, as an elected official earlier in his career, ""was stopped seven times by law enforcement in one year."" Other well-known figures, from former Attorney General Eric Holder to broadcaster Don Lemon to professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., have reported similar experiences. And then there are the men whose final moments many of us have witnessed, in all their horror, thanks to mobile phone videos. You can't watch the deaths of Terence Crutcher, Eric Garner, and Philando Castile without being shaken. In most cases, what you see in the video, or in direct testimony after the tragedy, is the officer's fear.... The Implicit Association Test--which you can take on the Project Implicit website--""shows biases that are not endorsed and that may even be contradictory to what one consciously believes."" For instance, ""you may believe that women and men should be equally associated with science, but your automatic associations could show that you (like many others) associate men with science more than you associate women with science."" Does that make you a bad person? No. Does it affect your behavior? Probably. Should you own up to your bias and try to overcome it? Absolutely.This is essentially a religious command to confess your Original Sin in exchange for some small voice in negotiating your punishment. The difference is that Christian religion views atonement and penance as individual affairs. But the progressives' Church of the State wants to stuff entire populations into its confessional at once, and then padlock the doors.Saletan is right about implicit bias theories being more ""useful"" than old-school rants about universal broad-brush racism - as in, more politically useful to statists. It's easier for the masses to swallow, because it absolves them of conscious guilt, replacing it with subliminal guilt.Also, Saletan says white people don't have to teach their children to worry about being the victims of implicit bias, because their ""color doesn't attract suspicion."" That's not true at all. It's not difficult to find neighborhoods or universities where white skin color does generate a damaging response. Part of the problem with this ""implicit bias"" theory is that it's so unwilling to come to terms with the idea that everyone makes judgments. In fact, that's the essence of being human -- the ability to understand data, share experiences, calculate probability and respond rationally to best protect themselves and their loved ones. Whether trying to avoid crime, to enjoy romance or to profit from gambling, to succeed in work or to avoid car-crashes, humans must make quick judgements based on limited information, and they do it by learning from books and experience. They can't approach each new problem as if they are a blank-sheet baby free off any bias or preferences -- or else they'll be mugged, dumped, broke, unemployed and car-less in very short order. Liberals are trying to clutter up that reality by inventing ever more esoteric justifications for giving themselves more power over everyone's lives.We'll doubtless be arguing about police bias and profiling for many years to come, but on this topic, the hard truth is that some portion of that ""implicit bias"" is logical. The Left is driving our society insane by forcing it to ignore blatant realities of urban crime known by every rookie cop.Likewise, whatever ""implicit bias"" association of men with science that might be ferreted from the public mind is probably connected to the higher number of male scientists - especially male scientists the layman has heard of, which is a rather small group, and its maleness partly is a function of unchangeable history. Despite fervent political assertions to the contrary, there is little reason to believe the continuing prevalence of men in various scientific fields is the result of a nefarious misogynistic conspiracy to keep lady doctors down.
It is wise to become nervous when politicians begin touting vague psych research -- instead of replicable research or cold, hard numbers -- to justify their agendas. Every flavor of statism has taken a stab at classifying resistance to its demands as insanity. In the less brutish incarnations of statism, this is done for the precise reason implicit bias advocates so eagerly state: to relieve the masses of individual, conscious responsibility for their fatal flaws. You're not evil, you're sick, they tell us. Sickness can be treated.Statists understand that average people view government's destructive powers as a force that should be deployed primarily against criminals... so they teach everyone to think of themselves as criminals. We all deserve to be punished for our social-justice transgressions, fined heavily for unfairly benefiting from implicitly biased society, and controlled lest we prey upon one another.Conservatives learn from history, and so they trust people enough to delegate power and autonomy to individuals of every background. Criminal law is reserved for actions, while thoughts remain private beyond the reach of legislators, cops or priests. Hope for absolute justice is reserved for dreamers and scribblers and is postponed into the afterlife. The past is kept in the past, so people look forward, instead of perpetually fighting over the sins or sufferings of their great-great-grandparents. But statism uses coercive force to impose collective ""justice"" in this fallen world, which requires unjust treatment of today's people for yesterday's sins, so the Elect can build a heaven on Earth by tomorrow.""Innocent until proven guilty"" is the self-restraint of leaders willing to delegate power, while ""guilty until proven innocent"" is the justification and tool of impatient utopians, whether they be progressives, socialists or the Taliban. We don't need our inept, greedy Ruling Class fooling around with any more victimhood theories, pushing beyond ""guilty until proven innocent"" to a new vision of ""guilty even though you are innocent.""  Watching progressives try to open this Pandora's Box of ego and cruelty is like watching clowns juggle dynamite in a crowded school.
Every day, in one city or another, black and brown parents sit their kids down and talk to them about bias. They explain that at some point, based on the color of your skin, you might be suspected of doing something wrong. Don't go to certain places, don't wear certain clothes, and don't move in any way that might be construed as a threat. Play it safe.

I had lost my own congressional race in Illinois, but had made enough friends among fellow GOP candidates that they graciously allowed me to join the festivities.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERInside, there was excited talk about the new Tea Party class, about fixing Washington, about finding places to live in high-rent D.C. And there was also talk about women -- that kind of talk.Some of the new members, many of whom had spent the day surrounded by young, attractive, ingratiating, dressed-to-the-nines female would-be staffers, wondered aloud how they were going to avoid the temptations of being surrounded every day by such creatures.The details do not matter: suffice it to say the language used was not that much better than the newly-surfaced lewd chat that Donald Trump had with Billy Bush on a live mic, eleven long years ago.Not every man talks that way about women. But plenty do -- in the locker room, on the golf course, and on Capitol Hill. I was once taken aback when one congressman praised my wife's looks, in rather lurid terms.Some of the same Republicans are beating a disgraceful retreat from Trump, acting as if they have never heard such language before.Lewd talk is bipartisan. Elections are about choices, and the choice on the Democratic side is not Pope Francis, but the Clintons. Bill not only had oral sex with an intern in the Oval Office, and lied about it, but has faced repeated accusations of sexual assault. Hillary has done her part by attacking Bill's accusers, calling them ""bimbo eruptions.""Perhaps the most glaring case of hypocrisy is that of former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. In his bodybuilding days, Schwarzenegger was notorious for -- and proud of -- his many exploits with women. In his 1977 autobiography, Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder, Schwarzenegger recalled how he had once treated women as ""sex objects."" (He said his views had changed.) When he ran for governor, he faced questions about a 1977 interview in which he recalled rough sex with a woman at a California gym: ""Everybody jumped on her and took her upstairs where we all got together,"" he had said.As governor, Schwarzenegger not only cheated on his wife, Kennedy scion Maria Shriver, but impregnated the housekeeper.Yet on Saturday, The Terminator joined the chorus of critics bashing Trump, telling fellow Republicans that it was their ""duty"" to ""choose your country over your party"" when they voted.Sen. John McCain, whose own treatment of women was a topic of concern in the 2008 election -- dating strippers, alleged affairs, rumors that he used the ""c-word"" towards his wife -- withdrew his support for Trump on Saturday. And 2012 nominee Mitt Romney, who was accused of leading a ""war on women"" and ridiculed for his statement about ""binders full of women,"" slammed the Republican nominee (again) for a statement made long before Romney eagerly sought his endorsement in 2012.Other Republican leaders are demanding Trump drop out of the race. The Republican National Committee has withdrawn its mailings for Trump. Chuck Todd of NBC News reported Saturday that right now, ""it's every Republican for themselves.""They are worried that Trump's 2005 comments -- made when he was a businessman, TV star, and private citizen -- will be the next Todd Akin moment, when Republicans let Democrats saddle them with one odd comment about abortion in 2012. Then as now, Republicans compounded the damage by treating a media controversy as a ""crisis.""It is worth asking whether this panicked mob has the rudimentary courage required to stand up to the Islamic State, or Vladimir Putin, if they cannot bear the pressure of a manufactured ""October surprise.""If they are willing to lose the country -- for that is what may be at stake -- over a decade-old joke, they might deserve to lose.And if Trump wins regardless, look out: he will have done it on his own.Joel B.

It's 'save the Senate majority and the House majority.'""He continued: ""Every Republican I've talked to that isn't in Trump Tower has essentially said the presidential race is over.""Todd also told the Today show that Trump's comments about groping women -- recorded surreptitiously on a live mic in 2005 as he joked with Access Hollywood anchor Billy Bush -- are unrecoverable, and could destroy the entire Republican Party.At no point did Todd cite polling data to support his claims, which appeared to be his own analysis, reported at the top of the news hour. On MSNBC earlier in the day, Todd had also opined that the GOP nominee had ""lost the moral authority to lead.""Todd did not compare Trump's words, for which the candidate apologized twice on Friday, to Bill Clinton's conduct in office, which Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has been accused of enabling by attacking women who accused him.Several prominent Republicans distanced themselves from Trump, and others withdrew their support, perhaps having in mind the controversy over comments by Rep. Todd Akin (R-MO) in 2012, who fumbled a question about abortion by talking about what he called ""legitimate rape.""Democrats linked Akin to every Republican in races across the country, using women's outrage to help defeat Republican nominee Mitt Romney and hold a majority in the Senate.Joel B.

New York magazine called Biden ""the president of Awkwardly Whispering in Women's Ears.""

The New York Times quoted Johnson saying, ""The business of being able to de-escalate situations, I think, is paramount to what we're going to do.""Dean Angelo Sr. is president of the union that represents Chicago officers and he does not like the proposals. He fears they will hinder officers' use of lethal force in time of need and lead to more instances of officer injury and death. The overwhelming trepidation that prevented the female officer from using lethal force Wednesday is a good example.Angelo stressed that officers are not getting the gratitude they should be getting for the work they already do to save lives, and he appeared to indicate that he hopes officers continue to take whatever actions necessary to save their own lives when push comes to shove. He said:At the end of the day, when an officer is confronted in that alley or an officer is confronted in a life-or-death situation, they are going to do what they is necessary to go home. If they getting written up for it, so be it. My concern is that these guys and girls go home to their families.A report from a task force assembled by Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D) is a driving force behind the proposed limits on use-of-force. The task force concluded their report by writing, ""C.P.D.'s own data gives validity to the widely held belief the police have not regard for the sanctity of life when it come to people of color."" It follows that part of the new proposal is a requirement that officers ""consider a suspect's race"" before drawing their guns.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

Clinton over her GOP rival Donald J. Trump, 47 percent to his 39 percent, according to the Oct. 4 Breitbart/Gravis poll of 1,248 registered voters.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""Oregon is a solidly Democratic state, but it has also been the site of political turmoil and unrest against its party establishment,"" said Doug Kaplan, the managing partner of Gravis Marketing, the Florida-based polling firm that conducted the poll. The poll carries a 2.8 percent margin of error.Kaplan said Libertarian Gary Johnson was the choice of four percent and Green Party nominee Dr. Jill Stein had the support of two percent of the electorate.""It would be a stretch to say that Oregon is in play, but it is also a state that both parties had ignored in presidential campaigns,"" he said. In the 2012 election, President Barack Obama beat the GOP nominee W. Mitt Romney with 54 percent of the vote to 42 percent for the former governor of Massachusetts.The poll does reveal Oregon's political tumult, Kaplan said.Thirty-eight percent of respondents have a strongly favorable opinion of the president and 36 percent have a strongly unfavorable opinion.When asked if the country was going in the right direction or the wrong direction, 38 percent said America was going in the right direction and 53 said the wrong direction.Respondents were asked if it was a good idea when the Obama administration transferred the federal government's control of the Internet to a non-governmental consortium and 64 percent said it was a bad idea; six percent said it was a good idea.Another question dealt with Clinton's extension of the president's refugee programs: Hillary Clinton's supporters at the Refugee Council want to increase the number of refugees coming into the United States in 2017 even more, to 200,000, and Hillary wants to increase the number of Syrian refugees in that total from 10,000 in 2016 to 65,000 in 2017. Do you approve or disapprove of this increase?In this question, 30 percent of Oregon voters approve, 60 percent disapprove, and 10 percent were unsure.In the Senate race, Sen.

But a look at some of the information released by Wikileaks reveals that the Democrat nominee has more recently changed her story and admitted that the Marines did not reject her because of her gender.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROne of the earliest reports on Hillary's rejection claim came from The New York Times' Maureen Dowd, who in 1994 reported Clinton's claims as delivered at an event meant to honor military women hosted at the Capital in Washington D.C.Dowd reported that Hillary told those gathered that she was rejected by the Marines because she was a woman. Dowd wrote that in 1975, the year she married Bill Clinton and when she was teaching at the University of Arkansas law school in Fayetteville, Hillary said she went to the Marines to see if she could sign up.She was 27 then, she said, and the Marine recruiter was about 21. She was interested in joining either the active forces or the reserves, she recalled, but was swiftly rebuffed by the recruiter, who took a dim view of her age and her thick glasses. 'Not Very Encouraging.'""You're too old, you can't see and you're a woman,"" Mrs. Clinton said she was told, adding that the recruiter dismissed her by suggesting she try the Army. ""Maybe the dogs would take you,"" she recalled the recruiter saying.""It was not a very encouraging conversation,"" she said. ""I decided maybe I'll look for another way to serve my country.""It was a story that Clinton would tell for years.However, it appears that in some of the more recent speeches Hillary was paid millions to deliver to banks and corporations she contradicted that long time story about how the Marines so abrasively rejected her.According to transcripts released by Wikileaks, in a speech at the annual meeting of the American Society for Clinical Pathology in September of 2013, Hillary had a completely different story than she gave in the Capital in 1994.When asked by a member of the audience if in 1975 she was rejected from the Marines because she was female, Clinton said no and then explained she was rejected because she was ""too old.""This according to the excerpt from her 2013 appearance:Question from the audience: Is it true that until 1975 you applied for the Marines and they told you no because you were a female?Hillary: No. Here is what did happen: It was actually -- there was a recruiting station, and I thought, you know, maybe I should consider serving my country by joining the military. So I walked into the recruiting station, and the person on duty was a Marine. And I think I was 26, maybe 27, so, an older potential recruit. I said to the young Marine, I said, ""Well, you know, I'd be interested in getting some information to see whether I could maybe serve. I'm a lawyer. Maybe I could help in some way."" He says, ""Well, I think you are too old for the Marines but maybe the dogs will take you."" I said, ""The dogs?"" He goes, ""Yeah, you know, the Army."" I said, ""Well, it doesn't sound like I'm going to be welcome so...""So, it appears that her claim about being rejected by the U.S. Marines because she had bad eyesight and because she was a woman had mysteriously vanished from her story between 1994 and her speech to the clinical pathology group in 2013.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.She was 27 then, she said, and the Marine recruiter was about 21.

Libertarian Gary Johnson got 10 percent, and Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein got 3 percent, while 6 percent were unsure. The poll has a margin of error of 2.8 percent at the 95 percent confidence level and was conducted using a combination of automated telephone calls and an internet panel of cell phone users. The results have been weighted by voting demographics.Fifty-six percent described the country as going in the wrong direction, while 36 percent described it as going in the right direction and 8 percent didn't know.

Only 30 percent approved of Clinton's refugee plan, and 11 percent were unsure.This poll is the second in as many weeks from Breitbart News and Gravis Marketing that shows a close race in Colorado, which has 9 all-important electoral votes that could decide the election. The previous poll had Trump leading Clinton by 4 points, just outside that survey's margin of error. Trump, on Monday of this week, held a pair of events in Colorado--and this poll was conducted while he was doing those events and in the immediate aftermath.Combined with current polling in other battleground states--where Trump is ahead in states like Nevada, Ohio, Iowa, and Maine's second congressional district, and polling even with Clinton in North Carolina, Florida, and Pennsylvania among other states--Trump would have enough electoral votes to win the election were it held now if current polling were correct.At Trump's Colorado events earlier this week, as Breitbart News reported from on site, he had thousands upon thousands of people attend.CO v4a by breitbartnews on ScribdSIGN UP"

""That's why I don't see how, given the current deployment of the opposition forces and Al Qaeda's prominence among them, America could prepare for a military strike, from which Al-Qaeda would benefit the most, despite the name change.""Having said that, he continued, the assassination of Nusra Front commanders might change the picture in terms of giving Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan and Turkey a green light to arm the rebels with advanced weapons.""Neither at the diplomatic level are the Americans preparing for the day after,"" he added. ""Even in the event that they launch a strike and the Syrian forces retreat to their lines on the eve of Russia's intervention, what is America's plan, given that Turkey, Syria, Iran, and even Egypt, and to a certain extent Jordan as well - i.e., all of Syria's neighbors - oppose a federation solution?""He believes the leaked reports in the U.S. media about possible action are meant to gauge Russia's response, ""but this is clearly a textbook case of high rhetoric and media frenzy functioning not just as a vessel but as a policy in and of itself. They're using aggressive rhetoric for deterrence, in this case of the Russian army that has continually come to Assad's rescue.""""In the wake of the Iran nuclear deal, Syria's use of chemical weapons and the threats the U.S. government made in both cases, which have greatly disappointed its allies, it seems highly unlikely that the administration, shortly before the presidential elections, would change what has been its policy for the past eight years, which has shown great weakness in securing the vital interests of America's allies.""SIGN UP"

"Columbus Day is under attack again, and there's more at stake than Italian- American pride. The campaign against Columbus Day is not anti-Italian, it is anti western civilization.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROctober 12 has been a federal holiday since 1931 and this year, President Obama issued the customary Presidential Proclamation on October 9. Colorado was the first state to celebrate Columbus Day in 1907. Twenty one states officially celebrate it as a state holiday as well. But none of that matters to the crusaders for ""Indigenous People's Day.""Colorado has held a Columbus Day Parade since 1909, and legislation to eliminate or change Columbus Day was defeated in the state legislature only a year ago on a bipartisan vote. But none of that stopped the 12 Democrats on the Denver City Council from declaring last week that henceforth, October 12 will be known as ""Indigenous People's Day."" Ten other cities and the state of Vermont- all of them controlled by ""progressives"" -- now recognize Indigenous People's Day in place of Columbus Day.You may well be asking, if representatives of Native American tribes insist on a new holiday to recognize ""indigenous peoples,"" why not do that and leave Columbus Day alone? The answer is that the campaign against Columbus Day is not really about Columbus, it is about the alleged ""racism"" inherent in celebrating the arrival of Europeans in North America.""Indigenous People's Day"" is the perfect expression of political correctness applied to national holidays. To the progressives, Columbus Day must be abolished because it is implicitly racist, and America must atone for its sins by abolishing it.But if ""racism"" is the underlying issue with Columbus Day, why replace it by another holiday based explicitly on racism? Celebrating ""Indigenous People"" means celebrating people of one particular race, American Indians, as more virtuous and therefore superior to people of another race- white Europeans.Once you start down that muddy, slippery anti-Columbus road, there is no turning back. The anti-Columbus campaign makes sense only if the goal is to banish any recognition or celebration of the achievements not of Columbus the man but of Western Civilization. The progressives insist that all Americans must agree with them that arrival of Columbus and the European settlement that followed was a bad thing not a good thing.Here is the crux of the matter. Columbus's successful voyage of discovery in 1492 opened the New World to European exploration and settlement, and for multiculturalists, that is the Original Sin that must never be celebrated -- and must never be forgiven.That is why it is a mistake to think the battle over Columbus Day is important only to Italian Americans. The battle is important to all Americans because it is clear that this anti-Western crusade will not stop until October 12 is changed to White Guilt Day- not just in Denver or Phoenix or Chicago, but for all of America by way of congressional declaration.To the progressives, it would not be enough to stop honoring the man Columbus and his achievements: Americans must accept our national guilt, admit the inferiority of Western Civilization , and begin the painful process of reconciliation with multicultural values. That is why they reject the suggestion of a separate Indigenous People's Day in November. Celebrating the value and achievements of pre-Columbian Native American cultures would not be an explicit rejection of European civilization, and that is their primary objective.It does not seem to disturb progressive politicians that changing October 12 to Indigenous People's Day would be equally ""racist"" to marching in a Columbus Day Parade. Just like they do in other political arenas on other issues, when politically convenient they turn a blind eye to the historical facts, and it is a well established fact that many of the tribes of pre-Columbian North and South America practiced slavery on a wide scale.The progressives are deeply committed to the lie and historical myth that Europeans invented slavery as a tool of colonialist (capitalist) exploitation and brought it to the peaceful, virtuous peoples of the New World. Both claims are flatly untrue.The unvarnished, politically incorrect truth of the matter is that human slavery existed across the planet in dozens of cultures for thousands of years before Columbus and before the African slave trade brought slavery to the West Indies and America's shores. Secondly, the indigenous peoples of the Americas practiced slavery among themselves centuries before the arrival of Columbus or Cortez. So, using slavery as the defining characteristic of racism has no basis in history or in logic.So, the centuries-old practice of slavery has nothing to do with ""racism,"" but if that is your mantra, then the indigenous peoples of the Americas were as racist as the Europeans, Asians, Arabs and Africans who practiced slavery.The indigenous tribes of North America not only practiced slavery among themselves for centuries before the arrival of Columbus, some of them readily adapted to the availability of African slaves once the African slave trade was established. There is ample historical record of the Seminoles, Chickasaw, Cherokee, Choctaw and Creek tribes owning African slaves in the pre-Civil War period. At the time of Columbus' arrival, the Caribs practiced not only slavery but cannibalism.The attacks on Columbus Day have little to do with the celebration of myriad Native American cultures, and if successful, the establishment of ""Indigenous People's Day"" in various cities will not mean a halt to the attacks on Columbus and the ""European migration.""If the politically correct multiculturalists have their way, the only logical end game for the anti-Columbus campaign is to force Congress to terminate Columbus Day and substitute in its place White Guilt Day. Why settle for half-way measures?Tom Tancredo is a former congressman and presidential candidate.

Yet, a new study validates what grassroots parent groups have known all along: the federally funded program, which most states lapped up for a quick infusion of federal cash, has bombed.In a study released in September at Education Policy Analysis Archives, authors Mindy Kornhaber, Nikolaus Barkauskas, and Kelly Griffith examined both the ""federal and philanthropic funding for the reform"" and conclude:In essence, those who set directions for the Common Core and those who provided resources for its implementation have benefited, even as potential benefits to schools, educators, and students are elusive, and the entire claim may ultimately be empty.In a review of the study, titled ""Smart Money? Philanthropic and Federal Funding For the Common Core,"" Teresa Mull of The Heartland Institute writes at the Washington Times:None of this is news to anyone who has paid attention to the tremendous costs of Common Core or the devastating consequences it's had on U.S. education. It would be fun to say, ""We told you so,"" but we can't get our money back or our children's lost educational opportunities -- at least, not in time to regain what was wasted in the years they sat in classrooms in which they were taught confusing math problems and downright dangerous literature.The Common Core is a federally promoted education initiative introduced in the Obama administration's 2009 stimulus bill through a competitive grant program called Race to the Top (RttT). States could apply and compete for federal grant money and waivers from federal regulations as long as they adopted a set of uniform standards and aligned curricula and tests, agreed to a massive system of student data collection, and signed onto teacher evaluations that would be based on student performance on assessments aligned with the standards.The standards were developed by three private organizations in Washington D.C.: the National Governors Association (NGA), the Council for Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), and progressive education company Achieve Inc. All three organizations were privately funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and none of these groups are accountable to parents, teachers, students, or taxpayers.There is no official information about who selected the individuals to write the Common Core standards. None of the writers of the math and English Language Arts standards have ever taught math, English, or reading at the K-12 level. In addition, the Standards Development Work Groups did not include any members who were high school English and mathematics teachers, English professors, scientists, engineers, parents, state legislators, early childhood educators, and state or local school board members.The state boards of education of 46 states signed onto the unproven Common Core standards with little, if any, public or media scrutiny prior to even seeing the standards themselves.Parent activist groups have met with substantial resistance from both Republican and Democrat governors and state legislators in their quest to repeal Common Core in the states. The fact that political pressure from big business groups, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce - a major supporter of Common Core - and the threat of having federal funds pulled from their states, led most state lawmakers and governors to dismiss parental concerns.Only three states have officially repealed the standards, but at least two of those simply ""rebranded"" them, or - save for a few tweaks - essentially gave the same standards a different name to appease grassroots parents' groups.Nevertheless, the annual Education Next poll shows that public support for the Common Core State Standards has fallen to a record low.According to the survey, support for the Common Core education plan dropped to 50 percent this year, down from 58 percent in 2015 and from 83 percent in 2013.The poll finds that, among teachers, support for the program has dropped from 87 percent in 2013, to 54 percent in 2014, to 44 percent in 2015, and continuing at that level in 2016.The poll surveyed 4,181 adults, aged 18 and older, including oversamples of 1,571 parents and 609 teachers during May and June.In addition, since 2011, state membership in the two federally funded consortia developed to create Common Core-aligned tests has dropped by 62 percent.In June, a report by ACT - the nonprofit that developed the college admissions and placement test that is administered to more than 1.8 million high school graduates annually - found college professors and employers voicing concern that Common Core failed in its primary goal: to prepare students for college and careers.ACT found that only 16 percent of college professors said their incoming students were well prepared overall for college-level work, down from 26 percent in 2009 and 2012.The Federalist's Joy Pullmann also reported in January that Common Core is estimated to have cost the nation as a whole $80 billion, in addition to the costs to individual states that have seen the tab for the education reform skyrocket.Mull writes:The researchers of the Smart Money study also show how many are profiting off of Common Core, except for our kids, of course. ""The claim stakers are the federal government and philanthropies that have staked out the Common Core for public policy,"" wrote the researchers. ""To work that stake, they incentivize states and school districts to mine the Common Core and get higher measured achievement. To do so, the miners need equipment. The vendors who sell the equipment profit in the short term, even if their tools rarely enable the miners to get the sought-after results.""Buying and selling textbooks, digital learning tools, and technology has been the name of the game with Common Core.In a Breitbart News exclusive, James O'Keefe's Project Veritas investigated the corporate cronyism embedded in the Common Core reform. The investigative researchers discovered that textbook publishing giant Pearson Education, for example, won the $1.3 billion contract to put Common Core-curriculum-loaded iPads into the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), despite the fact that other publishers outpaced Pearson in their bids for the contract.Writing at The Pulse 2016, American Principles Project education fellow Jane Robbins says that while philanthropic organizations such as the Gates Foundation, the federal government itself, and education nonprofits, such as Achieve, Inc. have all been ""winners"" in the Common Core game, the ""losers"" are students, parents, taxpayers, and local school districts.Another major loser, Robbins adds, is ""the Constitution and our federalist system, both of which were designed to protect state and local control over issues such as education.""In essence, those who set directions for the Common Core and those who provided resources for its implementation have benefited, even as potential benefits to schools, educators, and students are elusive, and the entire claim may ultimately be empty.None of this is news to anyone who has paid attention to the tremendous costs of Common Core or the devastating consequences it's had on U.S. education. It would be fun to say, ""We told you so,"" but we can't get our money back or our children's lost educational opportunities -- at least, not in time to regain what was wasted in the years they sat in classrooms in which they were taught confusing math problems and downright dangerous literature.The researchers of the Smart Money study also show how many are profiting off of Common Core, except for our kids, of course.

Both Trump and Billy Bush have apologized for the comments they made on the video.But anti-Trump forces in the media, at the Washington Post which broke the story, and other outlets, have engineered it into a major scandal. And the Bushes and anti-Trump Republicans appear at the center of every turn in it.Almost instantly, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush--a bitter Trump rival who has broken his pledge to support the eventual GOP nominee for president--denounced Trump, as did failed 2012 Republican nominee and fellow anti-Trump activist Mitt Romney.As the grandfather of two precious girls, I find that no apology can excuse away Donald Trump's reprehensible comments degrading women.-- Jeb Bush (@JebBush) October 7, 2016Hitting on married women? Condoning assault? Such vile degradations demean our wives and daughters and corrupt America's face to the world.-- Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) October 8, 2016Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman Reince Priebus, who's been disagreeable with Trump many times throughout the campaign, and House Speaker Paul Ryan--who's been trying to undermine Trump's ascent since it began despite endorsing him--both condemned Trump's remarks on the tape as well. Ryan also canceled Trump's scheduled appearance at a campaign stop in Wisconsin on Saturday.Interestingly, it seems as though this tape's release--and the rush by a bevy of anti-Trump Republicans to denounce him over the decade-old locker room-type banter--comes as Trump stays strong in the polls and prepares for the next debate on Sunday night in St. Louis, Missouri.Meanwhile, WikiLeaks just dropped a bombshell on Clinton's campaign--more two thousand emails from Podesta, which include scores of controversial remarks she made in private paid speeches before mega-donor crowds--but ironically the Chamber of Commerce's national political director Rob Engstrom called for Trump to drop out of the race and give the GOP nomination to his running mate, Indiana Gov.

After surviving an unprecedented level of crises for a major party presidential candidate--some fabricated, some real--he has survived a rough first debate. Now, walking into the second debate, he's still neck-and-neck with Clinton in the polls both nationally and in battleground states. And every effort to take him down--launched by the permanent political class in Washington, D.C., and the legacy media on the island of Manhattan in New York City--has thus far failed.Some, like Clinton supporter Sally Kohn, suggested that this effort was the last ditch desperation play to take down Trump once and for all.If this doesn't ruin Trump's candidacy, the problem isn't the misogynist candidate -- but the misogynist country.  https://t.co/iQzu5HLlDY-- Sally Kohn (@sallykohn) October 7, 2016So if Trump survives this one--after lasting through so many others--maybe nothing can take him out.UPDATE 12:58 P.M.Carly Fiorina, the failed vice presidential candidate of Sen.

It was posted on the WikiLeaks website.This thread of emails demonstrates the routine and intimate interaction between members of the campaign staff and the Clinton Foundation.Sen. Charles Grassley (R-IA), in a June 30, 2015 letter pointed out the for a matter of such importance, nearly 25 percent of the country's uranium deposits, the transaction was approved very quickly.Maura Pally, who handles communications at the foundation sent Podesta the email at 12:18 p.m.From: *Maura Pally* <maura.pally@gmail.com>
Date: Friday, July 3, 2015 Subject: Grassley letter
To: Cheryl Mills <cheryl.mills@gmail.com>, John Podesta < john.podesta@gmail.com>, Heather Samuelson <heather.samuelson@gmail.com>, Huma Abedin <ha16@hillaryclinton.com>
 Putting on all of your radars that Grassley sent a letter to AG Lynch (dated June 30th though we just saw it) asking questions about contributions to the Clinton Foundation and the Uranium One deal. Letter is attached. Craig is connecting with comms team to be sure they are aware as well.Podesta then forwarded the email to the next tier down: jpalmieri@hillaryclinton.com, kschake@hillaryclinton.com, tcarrk@hillaryclinton.com, creynolds@hillaryclinton.com roughly 90 minutes later at 1:49 p.m.That is Jennifer Palmeiri, who was President Barack Obama's director of communications before joining the Clinton campaign; Kristina Schake, one of the campaign's deputy communications directors; Tony Carrk, the campaign's research director and Christina Reynolds, another deputy campaign director.Remember, Podesta is the campaign chairman.Remember, too, that Podesta's company received a $35 million investment from a Russian company that the FBI warned was seeking to steal America technology and intellectual property in 2014..In the letter, Grassley spelled out his concerns:On April 23, The New York Times reported on details regarding the Clinton Foundation's ties to a number of investors involved in a business transaction that resulted in the acquisition of Uranium One, owner of U.S. based uranium assets, by Atomredmetzoloto (ARMZ), a subsidiary of Rosatom, a Russian government owned company. The transaction raised a number of national security concerns because it effectively ceded 20% of U.S. uranium production capacity to the Russian government.Due to that foreign involvement, a review of the transaction was conducted by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), whose membership includes the Secretary of State and of which Treasury is the chair. In addition, during critical stages of the acquisition approval, interested parties made large donations - some in the millions of dollars - to the Clinton Foundation while Ms. Hillary Clinton held the position of Secretary of State. When millions of dollars flow to decision makers who have substantial discretion to provide support for or against approval of controversial transactions, public confidence in the integrity of the process requires a commitment to transparency and responsiveness to oversight inquiries.After listing his concerns, Grassley requested the attorney general provide him with answers by July 16, 2016:The risk of conflicts with Secretary Clinton at State was so great that the Clinton Foundation and the Obama Administration entered into a memorandum of understanding which, in part, required donations to be disclosed. However, millions of dollars in donations to the Clinton Foundation from executives with an interest in the Uranium One/ARMZ transaction were not disclosed, breaching the agreement.Accordingly, please answer the following:

 Putting on all of your radars that Grassley sent a letter to AG Lynch (dated June 30th though we just saw it) asking questions about contributions to the Clinton Foundation and the Uranium One deal. Letter is attached. Craig is connecting with comms team to be sure they are aware as well.On April 23, The New York Times reported on details regarding the Clinton Foundation's ties to a number of investors involved in a business transaction that resulted in the acquisition of Uranium One, owner of U.S. based uranium assets, by Atomredmetzoloto (ARMZ), a subsidiary of Rosatom, a Russian government owned company. The transaction raised a number of national security concerns because it effectively ceded 20% of U.S. uranium production capacity to the Russian government.
Due to that foreign involvement, a review of the transaction was conducted by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), whose membership includes the Secretary of State and of which Treasury is the chair. In addition, during critical stages of the acquisition approval, interested parties made large donations - some in the millions of dollars - to the Clinton Foundation while Ms. Hillary Clinton held the position of Secretary of State. When millions of dollars flow to decision makers who have substantial discretion to provide support for or against approval of controversial transactions, public confidence in the integrity of the process requires a commitment to transparency and responsiveness to oversight inquiries.The risk of conflicts with Secretary Clinton at State was so great that the Clinton Foundation and the Obama Administration entered into a memorandum of understanding which, in part, required donations to be disclosed. However, millions of dollars in donations to the Clinton Foundation from executives with an interest in the Uranium One/ARMZ transaction were not disclosed, breaching the agreement.
Accordingly, please answer the following:
1. What role did the Department of Justice play in the Uranium One/ARMZ transaction? Please explain in detail.
2. Please list the Department of Justice personnel that were involved in the Uranium One/ARMZ transaction.
3. Did Secretary Clinton's relationship with the Clinton Foundation require her to recuse herself from the CFIUS's review of the Uranium One/ARMZ transaction? If so, did she
recuse herself? If the relationship did not require recusal, please explain why not.

It was the second time in nine months one of Musk's rocket projects blew up, but it wasn't his engineers he questioned about the latest mistake. It was his biggest competitor.Musk sent an employee to the offices of United Launch Alliance, which is near the launch facility in Cape Canaveral where the SpaceX rocket exploded, destroying a $205 million Facebook satellite it was paid $62 million to launch and delaying NASA commercial flights till 2018.The man asked if he could look around a bit on the roof of one of the buildings on the United Launch Alliance campus. He wasn't accusing anyone of anything; he was just trying to be thorough and explain the shadow, followed by a white flash, SpaceX analysts had noticed on the video.This, of course, was no better than the second-craziest explanation Musk had entertained for the rocket's failure. He also admitted he had ""not ruled out"" that UFOs could be involved.Officials at United Launch Alliance, a joint effort between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, declined to let the SpaceX visitor onto the roof, but it did let Air Force investigators check it out, and they found nothing of note. It's unclear whether Musk is satisfied with those findings.He called the explosion the ""most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years."" He later tweeted, ""Particularly trying to understand the quieter bang sound a few seconds before the fireball goes off. May come from rocket or something else.""Musk's talk was all vague, and the visitor he sent to his leading competitor was, by all reports, cordial. The company continues to investigate the cause with help from the Air Force, NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration and now has focused on a problem with the helium system in one of the stages. The company still doesn't understand why that system failed, Musk said at a meeting in Mexico last month.But as the Post pointed out in its story, the visit constituted ""an implication of sabotage."" Musk remains convinced the failures are not his or his company's but the result of mysterious malevolent outside forces. Maybe it's true. Maybe he's the rare guy who is not paranoid enough. Because he has one point: a lot of things do seem to go wrong with his expensive ventures.There's the crash back in January, a $112 million mistake after which Musk said the rocket wasn't destroyed, but the impact was sufficient to ""destroy the primary airframe and accordion the engines."" The goal is to be able to recapture the rocket by having it land on a drone ship at sea and ultimately to reuse it. This was one that won't be reused.This reflects what has become a strange pattern with Musk. He uses other people's money - in most cases, it comes from taxpayers - to fund highly risky ventures he doesn't always fully understand. When those ventures run into problems, he responds by tying the failures to the extraterrestrial world ... or at least to mysterious flashes on the roof of a building a mile away.He keeps dreaming big, which is good. He says he can get us to Mars 10 years faster than NASA and tens of billions of dollars cheaper, although he admits he can't get you home. ""We put that in the fine print,"" he says. ""[But] if you're going to choose a place to die, then Mars is not a bad choice.""He said after the January accident that it only strengthened his resolve for more ""experimentation"" in 2016. His goal: a 70 percent success rate with his rockets. That's a lot of expensive failure.And the longer this goes on, the more dependent he is on Washington to fund his dreams. As of 2015, which is now two rocket crashes ago, his big three companies - SpaceX, SolarCity and Tesla, the automaker - had gone through nearly $5 billion in government money and were staying afloat almost entirely thanks to taxpayer support.According to a recent SolarCity disclosure, SpaceX has about $900 million invested in SolarCity, and SolarCity and Tesla have millions invested in each other. And it's all enhanced by $5.5 billion in federal grants for SpaceX and $4.9 billion in subsidies and tax credits for Tesla and SolarCity. ""It's a Ponzi scheme propped up by your tax dollars,"" wrote one analyst in, of all places, Huffington Post.No one wants to stop Elon Musk from dreaming. But the country is $19 trillion in debt, deficits are edging over the $1 trillion per year again, and he hasn't demonstrated competence worthy of the investments. He can dream, but at this point, he needs to do it on his own nickel before things get any weirder.SIGN UP"

L. Dietsche, the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York, wrote in a booklet accompanying the exhibit, ""We may be ready to see 'Christa' not only as a work of art but as an object of devotion, over our altar, with all of the challenges that may come with that for many visitors to the cathedral, or indeed, perhaps for all of us.""The bronze statue, named ""Christa"" by its creator, British artist Edwina Sandys, had briefly been exposed in the Cathedral Church in 1984, but was soon removed after the church received a wave of complaints. It is now installed on the altar in the Chapel of St. Saviour, one of seven chapels in the ambulatory behind the choir.In depicting a female Christ, Sandys said, ""I wanted to portray the suffering of women,"" though she hopes the work appeals to both men and women.""In the past there were matriarchs in many societies and religions, and gender was not always a factor,"" Sandys said. ""Today women are finding their way to take their place in the Christian church and in society in general.""Christa is being exhibited together with the work of 21 other contemporary artists, as part of a show called ""The Christa Project: Manifesting Divine Bodies."" The show proposes to explore ""the language, symbolism, art, and ritual associated with the historic concept of the Christ image and the divine as manifested in every person--across all genders, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, and abilities.""The new show follows on the heels of another exhibition, a reprisal of 1970s feminist exhibition ""The Sister Chapel,"" which also showcased female portrayals of divinity.According to official church data, the Episcopal Church in New York State has been hemorrhaging members, and attendance at services has similarly declined.In the ten years between 2005 and 2015, membership in the Episcopal Diocese of New York dropped by 17 percent, from 64,027 members to 53,353 members. Average Sunday attendance at services also declined by 22 percent during the same period, from 21,723 to 16,878.Episcopal church baptisms and marriages dropped even more precipitously during the ten-year period, by 56 percent and 50 percent, respectively.Follow Thomas D.

Step down. Allow someone else to carry the banner of these principles,"" Lee said.Lee published a video on Facebook of his reaction to Trump after the Republican nominee apologized Friday evening for using degrading rhetoric about women in a conversation ten years ago with Access Hollywood's Billy Bush.

But in his video last night, Lee's frustration was clear.""This can't continue, it's time for us not to settle, it's time to expect more,"" Lee said.He appeared angry by Trump's definition of the leaked comments as a distraction.""With all due respect sir, you sir are the distraction, your conduct, sir, is the distraction, it's the distraction from the very principles that will help us win in November,"" he said.Lee called for a Republican candidate that reflected Republican principles, demanding a better candidate to lead them to defeat Hillary Clinton.""There will be time to figure out the who,"" said Lee.

Rigorous vetting already takes place while these refugees are still overseas, and it's a process that historically takes 18 to 24 months.Breitbart News asked the Clinton campaign to reconcile the differences between Secretary Clinton's 2013 private remarks, where she said Syrian refugees ""can't possibly"" be vetted, to her 2015 and 2016 campaign claims that ""vigilant"" screening and ""vetting"" of ""refugees from Syria, guided by the best judgment of our security and diplomatic professionals,"" will be sufficient to safeguard American citizens from ""jihadists coming in along with legitimate refugees,"" but there has not yet been a response.We also asked the Clinton campaign to explain if Secretary Clinton believes the United States has unique vetting capabilities superior to those of Jordan, which enable us to successfully vet Syrian refugees; she admits we cannot.The entire quote from Clinton's speech to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago's Vanguard Luncheon on October 28, 2013, included in the WikiLeaks document dump of Hillary Clinton's paid speeches reads as follows:So I think you're right to have gone to the places that you visited because there's a discussion going on now across the region to try to see where there might be common ground to deal with the threat posed by extremism and particularly with Syria which has everyone quite worried, Jordan because it's on their border and they have hundreds of thousands of refugees and they can't possibly vet all those refugees so they don't know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees. Turkey for the same reason.In September 2015, Hillary Clinton called for the United States to accept 65,000 Syrian refugees per year.Thousands of Syrian refugees reside in refugee camps in Jordan. A number of Syrian refugees reside in Jordan in locations other than official refugee camps.The majority of the more than 12,500 Syrian refugees who were resettled in the United States in FY 2016 came from their temporary residences in Jordan.According to a 2013 newsletter from the Jewish United Fund/Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Chicago, ""Former Secretary of State and Former U.S. Senator from New York, Hillary Rodham Clinton, will be the featured guest speaker for the Vanguard Event on behalf of the 2014 Jewish United Fund Annual Campaign.""Leslie Bluhm and Michael J. Sacks were listed as ""Vanguard Co-Chairs"" for the event. Bradley Jarol, Jodi A. Newmark, and Tom Rivkin were listed as ""Vanguard Vice Chairs.""""Attendance at this event requires a contribution at the Vanguard level to the 2014 Jewish United Fund Annual Campaign,"" the newsletter said.This year's Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago's Vanguard Luncheon will be held at the Hyatt Regency Chicago on November 7, the day before the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.Former Secretary of State Madeline Albright, who served under President Bill Clinton, and former Secretary of State Colin Powell, who served under President George W. Bush, will be the featured speakers. According to the registration page for the event, ""A $5,000 minimum donation to the 2017 JUF Annual Campaign is required to attend.""We also have to be vigilant in screening and vetting refugees from Syria, guided by the best judgment of our security and diplomatic professionals. Rigorous vetting already takes place while these refugees are still overseas, and it's a process that historically takes 18 to 24 months.So I think you're right to have gone to the places that you visited because there's a discussion going on now across the region to try to see where there might be common ground to deal with the threat posed by extremism and particularly with Syria which has everyone quite worried, Jordan because it's on their border and they have hundreds of thousands of refugees and they can't possibly vet all those refugees so they don't know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees.
