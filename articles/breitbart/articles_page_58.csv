Waiting buses were shown on state television.Intensified Russian and Syrian bombing of besieged rebel-held parts of Aleppo in the past weeks has hit hospitals, bakeries and water pumping stations, and killed hundreds of civilians.The United Nations has criticised unilateral ceasefires after long sieges, saying they can be helpful only if combined with humanitarian access for those who do not want to leave.The 250,000 civilians trapped inside the besieged rebel held parts of the city have so far stayed away from the corridors. The army blames rebels opposed to President Bashar al-Assad for preventing them leaving and says they use civilians as human shields.Rebels say the goal of Moscow and Assad is to empty rebel-held areas of civilians so they can take over the whole city.""They talk about humanitarian corridors, but why are they not allowing food into besieged eastern Aleppo to alleviate our suffering? We only need the Russian bombers to stop killing our children. We don't want to leave,"" said Ammar al Qaran, a resident in Sakhour district.State owned Ikhbariyah television said rebels had fired a barrage of mortars near to where ambulances had been heading to take patients from the besieged parts of the city for treatment in government-held areas.MEDICAL TREATMENTThe Syrian military said on Wednesday it would observe the temporary ceasefire to allow trapped civilians to escape and said it had pulled back to enable rebel fighters to leave the city via two designated corridors.""We guarantee a safe exit. Seize the opportunity and save your families,"" an army loudspeaker blared near an exit corridor, on live footage shown on the pro-Syrian government Lebanese news channel Mayadeen.""An appeal to our people ... we will extend every help from shelters to hot dishes and facilities that offer you medical treatment,"" said the army loudspeaker.To the rebels, the army broadcaster said: ""Drop your weapons, this is your last chance.""Since Russia intervened in the war a year ago, the government's side has gained the upper hand on numerous fronts, including Aleppo, where the opposition-held sector has been completely encircled for weeks.The Syrian army has pressed ahead with a major campaign, supported by Iranian-backed militias and Russian air power, to take full control of Syria's largest city, divided between rebel and government zones since 2012.The rebels, however, say they are preparing a large-scale offensive to break the siege of Aleppo and that the Russian air force has failed.""The coming battle is not going to be like others. We are waiting for the signal of the start of a decisive battle which will surprise the regime and its militias,"" Abu Obeida al Ansari, a commander from Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, the rebranded former al Qaeda affiliate Nusra Front, said in a statement on social media.SIGN UP"

Dolan asked.""When what should be nature's safest sanctuary, the mother's womb, becomes the most perilous place for the most innocent and fragile life, should we be shocked when any life deemed 'in the way' is in hunting season?"" he added.The Cardinal's message was meant to set the tone for October as Respect Life Month, but also comes in the midst of fierce political debate regarding the place of abortion in American society.Political lines have been clearly drawn for the upcoming presidential elections, with the Democratic platform defending ""unlimited abortion license,"" while the Republican ticket has declared itself to be pro-life.In Wednesday's presidential debate, Hillary Clinton defended her vote against a ""ban on late-term, partial-birth abortions"" by saying that the government has no business ""stepping in"" to outlaw the brutal practice.""I will defend Planned Parenthood,"" Clinton said in Las Vegas. ""I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women's rights to make their own healthcare decisions. We've come too far to have that turned back now.""Earlier this month, Denver Archbishop Samuel J. Aquila told Catholics that life issues--and especially opposition to abortion--must take absolute precedence in deciding whom to vote for in November's elections.""Catholics in good conscience cannot support candidates who will advance abortion,"" he wrote in the diocesan newspaper, The Denver Catholic.In a point-by-point comparison between the two parties, Aquila said that the ""most important"" change to official party platforms this year has been the Democrats' push to overturn the Hyde Amendment, which ""prohibits federal taxpayer money from being used for abortion.""The Democrats' platform is ""aggressively pro-abortion, not only in funding matters, but in the appointment of only those judges who will support abortion,"" Aquila warned. They are even trying to repeal the Helms Amendment, which ""prevents the U.S. from supporting abortion availability overseas,"" he said.On the other side of the aisle, ""the Republican party platform is supportive of the Hyde Amendment and just this year strengthened its support for life by calling for the defunding of Planned Parenthood, banning dismemberment abortion and opposing assisted suicide,"" he said.In his message for Respect Life Month, Cardinal Dolan noted that Saint John Paul II constantly preached two essential values without which civilization cannot endure: ""the dignity of the human person, and the sacredness of human life,"" two values that are now under attack.""If the baby in the womb can be sucked out and left dead, with health care workers coerced to perform the hideous procedure and all of us forced to pay for it..."" he said, ""well, then, human life is treated as rubbish, which can be eliminated to suit our preferences.""The Cardinal said that ""the sacredness of human life, from the instant of conception to the holy moment of natural passing"" is ""to be defended vigorously rather than diluted and then discarded.""Noting with gratitude that the two principles of the dignity of the human person and the sacredness of human life are ""at the foundation of our Republic,"" the Cardinal urged ""patriotic Catholic citizens"" to be vigilant against all that threaten them and fully committed ""to promote and defend them.""Follow Thomas D.

An international tribunal has accused the Assad regime of carrying out the assassination, which led to mass protests and the withdrawal of Syrian troops from the country.On Wednesday, Al-Akhbar newspaper, which is close to Hezbollah, said that Hariri had informed his political bloc and his allies of his decision to endorse Aoun.""All that's left is to officially announce it,"" added Al-Akhbar.Aged 81, the ex-general Aoun is a controversial figure.He served as head of the armed forces and briefly as prime minister during Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war and was then a staunch opponent of the Syrian military presence in Lebanon.But he shocked many by brokering an alliance with Hezbollah in 2006, a year after his return home from exile in France and after Syria pulled its troops from Lebanon.According to a source close to Hariri, the ex-prime minister struck a deal with Aoun to endorse him in exchange for his return as premier.Under Lebanon's constitution, the country's president is elected by parliament, and the post is always reserved for a Maronite Christian under a power-sharing agreement.The post of prime minister is reserved for a Sunni Muslim, while the speaker of the parliament is a Shiite Muslim.SIGN UP"

This statement referred to the Heller decision, so he asked her to explain her opposition to that ruling.Clinton's response began with her saying she supports the Second Amendment. She then segued to talking about the various gun controls she wants to enact and finally, to claiming the Heller decision endangers toddlers. She said:I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns. So they wanted people with guns to safely store them.In responding to Clinton's answer, Donald Trump described Heller as a ""well-crafted decision"" supported by ""people who believe in the Second Amendment."" He went to say that he recalled Hillary Clinton being ""extremely upset"" when the decision was handed down. Wallace looked at Clinton and said, ""Where you extremely upset?""Clinton responded:I was upset because dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns. Because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions.She then restated her support for the Second Amendment, and stressed that such support is ""not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation.""In reality, the Heller decision was largely about the Washington DC handgun ban that took effect in 1976. That ban was contained in Firearms Control Regulations Act (FCRA), which also contained requirements that any rifles or shotguns be disassembled or otherwise rendered inoperable while  in the home. CBS News reported that Sterling Tucker -- DC City Council chairman when the FCRA was passed -- made clear that banning handguns was the central focus.

I wanted to see--did Secretary Clinton ever have any conversations with Robert Creamer about the contents of that video?""ROBBY MOOK: ""They've never worked for our campaign so you're going to have ask them about that.""BREITBART NEWS: ""Has she ever had any conversations with Robert Creamer about the contents?""ROBBY MOOK: ""I don't believe so. And they've never worked for our campaign.""It's thus far unclear if Clinton herself has been involved in the matters, but the videos released from O'Keefe's team have upended the race for the White House. Creamer is a longtime leader of the Institutional Left. His Democracy Partners is the beating heart of the Democratic Party in that it connects the Clinton campaign, pro-Clinton Super PACs, the Democratic National Committee (DNC), various leftwing organizations, and major Democratic Party mega-donors. O'Keefe's video ripped that beating heart out of the left in this election by forcing Creamer's resignation, and upending the entire procedural manner in which the Clinton campaign, its allies in Super PACs, and the DNC coordinate with leftwing organizations.Creamer is hardly the only person to resign so far due to the fallout. Scott Foval, an organizer with liberal group Americans United for Change, was forced out as well.Sources tell Breitbart News there is more coming on the Project Veritas front.Creamer was directly connected to top Democrats, including President Barack Obama himself. White House visitor logs published by the Obama administration show hundreds of Creamer visits to the White House in recent years, including dozens of meetings with Obama himself.The O'Keefe videos came up during the debate on Wednesday evening, when Trump correctly noted-after Clinton claimed there was violence at his rallies-that it was her campaign and its allies causing it.""If you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence?"" Trump said. ""She's the one and Obama that caused the violence. They hired people -- they paid them $1,500, and they're on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things.""BREITBART NEWS: ""In the debate, the video about Democracy Partners came up.

Though Trump brought up Libya, as an example of one of Clinton's failures in office, he did not specifically mention Benghazi, and moderator Chris Wallace did not bring it up, despite his otherwise even-handed performance.Smith was a diplomat who died at the U.S. consulate compound along with Ambassador Christopher Stevens. Smith had written earlier in the day that he believed the consulate's security guards were in fact casing the building for a potential attack. Stevens's earlier requests for more security in Benghazi had been denied by Clinton -- though she later claimed not to have read personally the cables he sent requesting additional security resources.Joel B.

Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman, to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her healthcare that one can imagine,"" Clinton said, adding that the issue is not only about Roe v. Wade, but also,""about what is happening right now in America.""Debate moderator Chris Wallace asked Clinton how far a woman's right to abortion goes, pointing out that she had said unborn babies have no constitutional rights and that, as a U.S. senator, she voted against a ban on late-term partial birth abortions.Clinton replied, without ever using the word ""baby"" to describe an unborn child at any stage of development:Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion, so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account. And, when I voted, as a senator, I did not think that was the case.The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking and painful decisions for families to make. I have met with women toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one can get: that their health is in jeopardy, if they continue to carry to term, or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy.Clinton winced as Republican candidate Donald Trump explained the gruesome procedure of late-term dismemberment abortion during which the baby is ripped apart limb by limb prior to being removed from the uterus.""That is not what happens,"" Clinton denied, and referred to Trump's description as ""scare rhetoric.""However, Clinton's claim that partial birth abortion should be protected due to a number of women who have serious health issues is not supported by research.A study published at the pro-choice Guttmacher Institute's Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health found that women seeking both first-trimester and late-term abortions provided the same reasons for delaying their abortions.Dr. Elizabeth Johnson, writing at the pro-life Charlotte Lozier Institute (CLI), observed that, in the study, women seeking both first-trimester and late-term abortions reported ""not knowing about the pregnancy,"" ""trouble deciding about the abortion,"" and ""disagreeing about the abortion with the man involved,"" with similar frequency.""Among women in the late-term abortion group, the most commonly cited reason for delaying the procedure was 'raising money for the procedure and related costs,'"" Johnson said.Those women in the late-term abortion group also gave reasons for delaying the procedure such as, ""difficulty securing insurance coverage,"" ""difficulty getting to the abortion facility,"" and ""not knowing where to go for an abortion,"" more often compared to women in the first-trimester group.Johnson concluded:For many years, abortion-rights advocates have asserted that abortions after 20 weeks are performed because of maternal health complications or lethal fetal anomalies discovered late in pregnancy.However, wider data from both the medical literature and late-term abortion providers indicates that most late-term procedures are not performed for these reasons.Previous survey studies of late-term abortion patients have confirmed that most late-term abortions are performed because of a delay in pregnancy diagnosis and for reasons similar to those given by first-trimester abortion patients:  financial stressors, relationship problems, education concerns or parenting challenges.""So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice,"" Clinton criticized during the debate. ""To the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country.""Fifteen states have moved to restrict abortion in various ways since the release of the videos last year that alleged Planned Parenthood sells the body parts of babies it aborts in its clinics.Additionally, in 2015, Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards testified before the House Oversight Committee that her organization does not provide mammograms, though she and others - including President Obama - have said that it does.While campaigning, Clinton has compared pro-life Americans to terrorists.""Extreme views about women, we expect that from some of the terrorist groups, we expect that from people who don't want to live in the modern world, but it's a little hard to take coming from Republicans who want to be the president of the United States,"" she said. ""Yet, they espouse out of date and out of touch policies. They are dead wrong for 21st century America. We are going forward, we are not going back.""""I will defend Planned Parenthood,"" Clinton said in Las Vegas. ""I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women's rights to make their own healthcare decisions. We've come too far to have that turned back now.""Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion, so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account.

That company is the world's largest money manager with assets of $4.65 trillion, according to Pension & Invest Research Center, which tracks Wall Street activities.James is proposing a new retirement savings structure that would completely ""scrap the 401(k) system"" that allows tens of millions of individuals to control their own retirement assets, in favor of a national ""Retirement Savings Plan."" He's doing this in combination with labor economist Teresa Ghilarducci at the left-wing Economic Policy Institute.If the plan becomes law, all non-union full and part-time employees would be forced deposit at least 3 percent of their annual salary into a ""Guaranteed Retirement Account."" Employers also would be forced to pay into the account. James and Ghilarducci claim creating this new ""self-funded pension"" would serve to ""supplement to Social Security payments.""The current 401(k) system is ""broken,"" and can ""only be fixed"" by an overhaul that includes a federal takeover. Ghilarducci asserted in her book, ""When I'm Sixty-Four: The Plot against Pensions and the Plan to Save Them."" She quotes a study by the Employee Benefit Research Institute that claims only 23 percent of workers age 45 and above have saved more than $250,000; and another study from the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College that reports Social Security on average will only replace about 40 percent of Americans' pre-retirement income.Both James and Ghilarducci justify their grab of most of Americans' retirement cash by claiming that the middle class will be ""all but decimated"" in retirement as a direct result of the current ""broken"" IRA system. They promise their mandatory participation savings will be guaranteed to ""earn"" the federal government's ""official inflation rate,"" plus 3 percent.But as Ed Butowsky who publishes the closely watched Chapwood Index comments, there are many ways that the promised financial return can be stealthily diverted back into government and private hands.For example, the 126-year-old Consumer Price Index (CPI) serves as the government's ""official inflation rate."" It was quietly adjusted in 1983 and again in 1995/96 by government officials to exclude items such as taxes, energy, and food. Butowsky points out that the motivation for the ""reconfigurations"" was understate the ""real"" inflation rate in order to reduce the explosive rise in the indexed cost of government spending on Social Security and entitlements.Butowsky argues that the excluded CPI items are not only necessities, but often comprise most of the daily spending by many middle-income and lower-income families. In contrast, the rich earn more money via investments that grow faster than inflation, so the understated CPI Index has a ""profound"" gradually and quietly shifts money away from most working Americans.According to the U.S. government's official inflation rate, the inflation rate was only 12.2 percent between 2008 and 2012. But the Chapwood Index that is separately calculated each quarter for America's 50 largest cities, reveals that the ""real"" cost of living in those urban centers is was more than 10.2 percent in 2012 alone.Wall Street is wildly enthusiastic over the idea that Clinton, James and other Democrats may be able to flip the entire $25 trillion Americans have invested in their IRAs into a gargantuan federally managed national Retirement Savings Plan. Unsurprisingly, James has stated that a few well-connected firms will be invited to manage Americans' money whether or not they like those firms.There's reason for Wall Street's confidence in Clinton, whose cozy relationship with Wall Street was outed by WikiLeaks' exposure of her paid speeches to Goldman Sachs.The supposed justification for a federal takeover of the ""broken"" retirement system has the familiar ring -- it is the same argument for the federal takeover of the ""broken"" healthcare system that led to the passage of Obamacare.SIGN UP"

On several occasions, she was forced to filibuster -- such as when moderator Chris Wallace asked her to explain her dream of ""open borders,"" which she revealed to a Brazilian bank in one of the confidential speeches released recently by Wikileaks. (Clinton's response was to claim, rather implausibly, that she was talking only about ""energy,"" and then to claim Trump was helping Russian hackers.)Wallace, in an understated way, was the star of the night: he was the only fair-minded moderator of the entire presidential series, who posed tough questions to both candidates and scolded the audience when it favored one side or the other. He also pressed Clinton on her conflicts of interest at the Clinton Foundation, refusing to allow her to wriggle away from the question by talking about the good work her charity does. And he challenged some of Trump's inaccurate past statements on Syria.With -- finally! -- a fair fight at hand, Trump showcased his strengths. He was, as one campaign source told Breitbart News shortly before the event, calm but aggressive, showing the fighting spirit that lifted him past the Republican field (though perhaps interrupting too often). Clinton, too, stood her ground on style, if not always on substance. She presented herself as a capable and experienced official with a flair for details -- even if she deployed those details as often to obscure as to explain.It was, in many ways, the slugfest that millions tuned in to see. There were no knockouts, though the challenger won on points, and showed improvement over the three debates.Whether that is enough to catch her in the polls remains to be seen.Joel B.

""And it's really an attack against a woman's right to choose, to make the most personal, difficult decisions that any woman would face, based on her faith and the medical advice that she's given.""""Yup,"" Podesta wrote to Richards. ""Took a little convincing. The tapes do hurt.""CMP's first video, released July 14, 2015, purported to show Planned Parenthood chief medical officer Dr. Deborah Nucatola discussing how to abort a baby intact in order to maximize the chances its body parts can be transferred to biomedical procurement companies.As more videos were released, Clinton dodged questions about them.On July 28, 2015, Clinton talked publicly about the video scandal in New Hampshire. Speaking to the Union Leader, she said she found the videos ""disturbing.""Breitbart News reported at the time:Clinton did not explain specifically what she found disturbing about the pictures she saw from the videos. She did not explain how they would be disturbing if abortion only deals with clumps of cells, entities that are not yet human or persons -- arguments commonly made by abortion advocates.Clinton went on the defend Planned Parenthood for all the good work she claims they do, including breast cancer screenings, something that has been disproven by the group Live Action, which actually called dozens of Planned Parenthood clinics asking for such screenings and was turned away.Clinton said any Congressional inquiries should not focus just on Planned Parenthood but ""should look at everything and not just one (organization).""  She also said any inquiry should look ""at the whole process."" Whether by ""process"" she means the wholesale and retail trade in body parts was not made clear.Then, in mid-September of 2015, CNN's Wolf Blitzer asked Clinton, ""Are you confident that Planned Parenthood, Madame Secretary, or any of its affiliated groups, if you will, haven't violated any federal laws?""Clinton responded by evading the question:Well, Wolf, let me tell you what I know, and that is, there is a willingness on the part of Planned Parenthood to answer questions. They have been doing so. Some people may not want to hear the answers, but they have certainly put those answers out there, into the public arena. And if the issue, the core issue that some on the stage last night, or some in the Congress are trying to promote, or trying to raise questions about, has to do with the kind of research that is done, legally, in the United States, then that is an issue that goes far beyond any Planned Parenthood example. So, I think it's important to sort out. There's a lot of emotion. There's a lot of accusations that are being hurled about. I think it's important to sort out, and try to actually figure out what is going on. If it's the services that they are trying to shut down, like providing family planning, or breast cancer screenings, that is just wrong, and women deserve to be given support, to get those services provided. If they want to shut down the legal provision of abortion services, then they've got a bigger problem, because obviously, they -Planned Parenthood does not use federal dollars to do that. And if they are more focused on the research that is going on, then that's a set of issues that certainly, is not only about Planned Parenthood. So, I would hope that the Republicans, and particularly the Republicans in the House, led by Speaker [Rep. John] Boehner (R-OH) would not put our country and our economy in peril, pursuing some kind of emotionally, politically-charged, partisan attack on Planned Parenthood to shut our government down. I think that would be a very, very unfortunate decision.On September 24, 2015 - a week after Clinton's CNN interview - Podesta emailed Richards again, this time asking her to call him.""I know you are up to your ass in alligators, but can you give me a call,"" he wrote. ""Take 5 minutes.""Clinton did not explain specifically what she found disturbing about the pictures she saw from the videos. She did not explain how they would be disturbing if abortion only deals with clumps of cells, entities that are not yet human or persons -- arguments commonly made by abortion advocates.
Clinton went on the defend Planned Parenthood for all the good work she claims they do, including breast cancer screenings, something that has been disproven by the group Live Action, which actually called dozens of Planned Parenthood clinics asking for such screenings and was turned away.
Clinton said any Congressional inquiries should not focus just on Planned Parenthood but ""should look at everything and not just one (organization).""  She also said any inquiry should look ""at the whole process."" Whether by ""process"" she means the wholesale and retail trade in body parts was not made clear.Well, Wolf, let me tell you what I know, and that is, there is a willingness on the part of Planned Parenthood to answer questions. They have been doing so. Some people may not want to hear the answers, but they have certainly put those answers out there, into the public arena. And if the issue, the core issue that some on the stage last night, or some in the Congress are trying to promote, or trying to raise questions about, has to do with the kind of research that is done, legally, in the United States, then that is an issue that goes far beyond any Planned Parenthood example. So, I think it's important to sort out. There's a lot of emotion. There's a lot of accusations that are being hurled about. I think it's important to sort out, and try to actually figure out what is going on. If it's the services that they are trying to shut down, like providing family planning, or breast cancer screenings, that is just wrong, and women deserve to be given support, to get those services provided. If they want to shut down the legal provision of abortion services, then they've got a bigger problem, because obviously, they -Planned Parenthood does not use federal dollars to do that. And if they are more focused on the research that is going on, then that's a set of issues that certainly, is not only about Planned Parenthood. So, I would hope that the Republicans, and particularly the Republicans in the House, led by Speaker [Rep. John] Boehner (R-OH) would not put our country and our economy in peril, pursuing some kind of emotionally, politically-charged, partisan attack on Planned Parenthood to shut our government down.
