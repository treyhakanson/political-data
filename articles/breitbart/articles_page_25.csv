Yet, Planned Parenthood receives over $500 million each year from American taxpayers.""Planned Parenthood stands alone as a major recipient of taxpayer funding that is also a major participant in elections,"" Casey Mattox, senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom, recently told the Daily Signal. ""They have pledged over $20 million in this election cycle alone. This is an organization that held up funding for Zika, for example, demanding their share of the money. All the while, they're managing to find $20 million to spend to support politicians that they want to keep in office.""Planned Parenthood's 2015 annual report shows the organization's total number of patients and services fell last fiscal year. Yet, somehow, and unlike any other ""business"" in that situation, its overall revenue increased.In its last year, Planned Parenthood served 2.5 million individuals, the lowest number since 1998. Its total number of ""services"" - which ranges from handing out condoms to abortions - dropped 11 percent, from 10.5 million to 9.5 million.In its last fiscal year, in fact, Planned Parenthood performed its least number of abortions since 2007 - down from 327,653 in 2014 to 323,999 in 2015.The abortion industry giant also experienced a $38.3 million decline in private donations as well last year.What did not drop, however, was its taxpayer funding. Despite fewer services and patients, Planned Parenthood received a 4.8 percent raise in taxpayer funding, from $528.4 million in 2014 to $553.7 million last fiscal year. According to its report, taxpayers now provide Planned Parenthood with 43 percent of its total income. As a result, last fiscal year, the abortion chain that calls itself ""nonprofit"" reported nearly $59 million in excess revenue, and more than $1.4 billion in net assets.The most recent IRS form 990 for 2014 shows that Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards' salary and compensation jumped to $957,952, double the salary she made just three years ago. In 2011, Richards' reported income was $420,153.""I would like to see Planned Parenthood even get more funding."" How to ensure all women have access to health care: https://t.co/kvD47CkwRR-- Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) January 15, 2016Hillary Clinton, however, says Planned Parenthood is underfunded. In January, Clinton said that - if elected president - she would urge Congress to give the abortion chain yet another raise in taxpayer funding. In addition, the Democrat nominee said Planned Parenthood - which was founded by eugenicist Margaret Sanger - would be one of her ""partners at the table"" as president, assisting her in increasing access to abortion, particularly for black and Hispanic women, in states that have restricted the procedure.Hyde hurts: Restricting Medicaid coverage of abortion forces 1 in 4 poor women to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term. #BeBoldEndHyde pic.twitter.com/rCvj40YIba-- Planned Parenthood (@PPact) September 30, 2016Clinton has also vowed to repeal the Hyde Amendment, a longstanding federal law that bars taxpayer funding of abortions through the Medicaid program.

The polls still favor Hillary Clinton to win. But Trump is about to play the move that has justified his unlikely nomination from the beginning.Trump's gamble has been that he can flip one, or more, reliably Democratic ""blue"" states. His home state of New York is out of reach, and probably always was. But he has at least a chance of winning Michigan or Pennsylvania, and he is making a long-shot bid at Minnesota.If he can flip one or more of those, Trump can lose in one or two of the typical ""swing"" states and eke out a narrow victory.Beyond all of the rhetoric, that is essentially the calculated gamble that Republican primary voters made in 2016. And it is a rational choice.In both 2008 and 2012, the party went with a ""moderate"" nominee in the hope of winning the swing states. The problem they faced was the Democrats' built-in advantage in the Electoral College, thanks to the votes of large blue states like California and Illinois.There is a reasonable argument to be made that a candidate like Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) might have had a better chance in the swing states than previous Republican nominees. But he ran into a wall of opposition on immigration. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush seemed to realize the importance of blue states, but his strategy was to run to the left, which doomed his primary chances.Trump realized, as other candidates did not, that immigration and trade were key issues to voters in Rust Belt states. And while he had held various different positions on immigration over the years -- he criticized Romney, ironically, for his allegedly harsh rhetoric in 2012 -- Trump had a consistent opposition to free trade deals, going back decades. That was his bridge to working-class voters.It is also partly why Trump looks likely to win Ohio, which no Republican can win the White House without. Honing in on that elusive prize, especially in the face of opposition from the state's sitting Republican governor, is an achievement for which Trump deserves more credit, assuming he can hold onto the state when all the votes are counted.The question is how much further he can go.The argument from Trump's remaining Republican opponents -- some of whom, unhelpfully, are still talking about retribution after Tuesday -- is that it is Hillary Clinton's weakness, not Trump's strength, that is responsible for the fact that he has a chance of winning, and that any other Republican would have done better. That counterfactual argument will frustrate future party unity in the event he loses.There is no way to resolve that question except through victory on Election Day, which will relegate such debates to the political science academy, where they belong.For now, the only important question is whether Trump's daring, and at times risky, outreach to working-class voters will conquer one, or more, of Clinton's strongholds.Conventional wisdom says not. But voters have the final say.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News. His new book, See No Evil: 19 Hard Truths the Left Can't Handle, is available from Regnery through Amazon.

She expected the Filipino immigrant to handle state secrets, further opening the Democratic presidential nominee to criticism that she played fast and loose with national security.Clinton would first receive highly sensitive e-mails from top aides at the State Department and then request that they, in turn, forward the messages and any attached documents to Santos to print out for her at the home.Among other things, Clinton requested Santos print out drafts of her speeches, confidential memos and ""call sheets"" -- background information and talking points prepared for the secretary of state in advance of a phone call with a foreign head of state.The New York Post goes on to quote various Clinton emails in which Clinton aides asked Santos to print sensitive and classified documents. This was such a common practice that the aides always referred to ""Marina"" by her first name.Those aides included Huma Abedin, the formerly indispensable top aide who suddenly vanished from public view after her husband Anthony Weiner's inappropriate message to an underage girl prompted the FBI to reopen its investigation of the Clinton email server.Abedin told FBI agents that Santos had access to the Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF, at Clinton's D.C. residence. She frequently ""collected documents from the secure facsimile machine for Clinton,"" according to notes from the FBI interview with Abedin.""Just how sensitive were the papers Santos presumably handled? The FBI noted Clinton periodically received the Presidential Daily Brief -- a top-secret document prepared by the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies -- via the secure fax,"" the New York Post reports.The procedures for securing a SCIF allow for government contractors to obtain certification to enter them, but the New York Post's report offers no indication Santos was ever classified as a contractor and certified. The FBI would certainly have obtained her certification documents, if that was the case. SCIF procedures specify very strict procedures for sanitizing such a facility before an escorted, non-certified individual enters, and those procedures prominently include securing and concealing exactly the sort of documents Santos handled.Intelligence experts have long complained about how Clinton's aides boosted sensitive material across the ""air gap"" by copying it from secure facilities and dumping it into emails sent from and received by her illicit private server. One of the most important features of a SCIF is that relaying sensitive material directly to unsecure systems like ClintonEmail.com is impossible.Clinton entrusted far more than the care of her DC residence, known as Whitehaven, to Santos.

""Life with the Clintons"" consists of ""scandal, after scandal, after scandal,"" he said as a man shouted ""Wikileaks!"" from the crowd. He sported a T-shirt with ""What Difference Does It Make,"" written on it; a reference to Clinton's infamous comment during a Benghazi hearing to address the loss of four American lives under her watch as secretary of state.That man told Breitbart News that he is ""a 30-year union brick layer for Trump,"" just one of many blue collar Americans who have thrown their support behind the billionaire businessman based on his promise to bring jobs back to America.Ryan added, the Clintons ""live by a different set of rules,"" to which the same man shouted out ""Bill Clinton's a rapist!""He continued, ""the point I'm trying to make is, do we want four years of that stuff?""Everyone shouted ""No!"" in near unison. ""Good Lord no,"" Ryan said. ""Let me tell you what we do need. We need courage."" His statement set the crowd roaring: ""Lock her up! Lock her up!""Ryan, amused at this point by the constant interruptions from the enthusiastic crowd, said, I've got a better idea... Let's make sure she never becomes president of the United States in the first place. How does that sound?""The crowd broke into applause, chanting, ""Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump!""Ryan responded, ""Just wait. I'm getting there."" Someone yelled out ""Let's hear it!"" A woman echoed his sentiment with, ""Yeah. Say it!""""Let me tell you this: When Donald Trump says that he wants a special session to repeal and replace Obamacare, let me tell you that as speaker of the house, we are ready, we are willing, and we are ready and we have a plan to do that.""The audience clapped and cheered. ""But that only happens if we win this election,"" Ryan pointed out.""Speaker Ryan was great,"" Tom Schwartz, 71, told Breitbart News. He said his biggest concern is the Supreme Court and that Obamacare came in at a close second. Tom, who is now retired, previously worked as a baker and delivery driver.Pence took the stage and called for Americans to unite ""with one voice. It's time to come home.""He continued, ""it's time to come home and elect Donald Trump as president of the United States. It's time to come home and reelect Speaker Paul Ryan and a strong Republican majority in the House of Representatives,"" and said this election is ""about our security, its about our prosperity and its about the law of the land.""He said Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson was a key leader on national security. Johnson is seeking reelection against Democrat Russ Feingold who is leading Johnson by one point in a tight race that could go either way.Pence noted that ""while the next president will serve a 4-year term, the next president is also going to set the course of the Supreme Court for the next 40 years.""The appointment of a justice to replace the late Antonin Scalia has become a major friction point in the battle to uphold a just interpretation of the Constitution. Many Republicans fear a Clinton SCOTUS appointment will result in restrictions on the 1st and 2nd Amendments.Pence suggested that with a Clinton presidency, there would be ""unelected judges using unaccountable power to legislate from the bench... For the sake of the Constitution, we must ensure here and now that the next president to make appointments to the Supreme Court of the United States is Donald Trump.""He added, ""Donald Trump is going to work with Speak Paul Ryan.""Pence and Ryan have shared a friendship spanning over a decade. Earlier, Ryan called Pence ""the heart of the conservative movement"" and Pence said of Ryan, ""if I'm the heart, he's the mind.""Ryan voted for Trump on November 1 and Saturday's event is a sign of growing unity among the Republican Party.Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope @AdelleNaz#Wisconsin: House Speaker Paul Ryan introduces Mike Pence at a rally in Mukwonago as part of Sen.

Simply put, there is no sugar. The drop in supply caused the price of sugar to soar from three Egyptian pounds a kilo a few years ago to five several weeks back, and to 10 and even 12 Egyptian pounds in the past few days. The government decided this week to set the price of subsidized sugar at seven Egyptian pounds per kilogram, a 40-percent increase since just before the current crisis.What's causing the problem? It seems to be the result of a worldwide sugar shortage combined with the cessation of sugar imports from abroad and a work stoppage at several sugar processing plants in Egypt.Sugar is a potent example of the many economic problems that plague Egypt.

From his post, Byrne watched the relationship between President William J. ""Bill"" Clinton and Monica Lewinsky blossom from hallway flirtations to their intimate encounters. Because of his unique vantage point and his daily interactions with the principals, Byrne became the first member of the Secret Service to testify against a sitting president.In addition to the scandals, Byrne told Boyle that the Clintons' tempestuous relationship made things uncomfortable for people working there.A typical incident that he wrote about in Crisis of Character was the morning the president walked into the Oval Office with a shiner under his eye that he tried to conceal with makeup. Byrne knew something was up before Clinton came into the office because he had come in early for his shift and made the rounds of his buddies at different posts. From the gossip, he was able to put together that the night before the Clinton' had a horrible screaming match with the noise carrying down the stairwells and elevator shafts. Then, there was a loud crashing sound.Byrne said he knew the place to go next: the White House curator's office. There he found a cardbox box sitting in a chair and in the box was the broken remains of a blue and white vase.""Bill and Hillary Clinton, like all humans, are flawed,"" he said.""Hillary is this person, who has this incredible lust for power and control,"" he said. ""But, she doesn't have the personality that draws people in.""The president is just the opposite, he said. ""He is all charm and he has personality. He is so charming, he could spin manure into gold.""When the two of them work together they become the perfect team, he said.""It's not what I think, it's what I know-really, the American people know it if they take the time to look,"" he said.Byrne said there were at least 19 serious scandals during the Clinton's last residency at the White House, and there are at least two serious scandals from the former first lady's tenure at the State Department.""I was in the middle of one of them, Monica Lewinsky, and I stood there and watched the others happen around me,"" he said.If the Clintons return to the White House, they cannot help themselves but to get in some other trouble, he said.They may become the first man and wife to become president and both be impeached, he said.""Do we really want to drag the country through that again? They won't have time to govern."" SIGN UP"

President Ronald Reagan declared April 4, 1982, a ""National Day of Reflection"" in the Rebbe's honor.Many visit the Rebbe's grave today -- as the Rebbe visited his predecessor's grave -- to pray and ask God for blessings.Last year, jockey Victor Espinoza, the jockey who rode American Pharoah to glory as the first Triple Crown winner since 1978, visited the Ohel prior to the all-important Belmont Stakes. As New York area CBS News affiliate WCBS 2 reported:Espinoza opened a prayer book, recited psalms, wrote out his own message and added his to a mountain of prayers at the sacred site.""It's always ask for the most important, (which) is health,"" Espinoza said. ""Without health, we cannot do anything.""Espinoza is not Jewish, but spiritual. He said after receiving a blessing from a rabbi at the Preakness last month, he scheduled the detour from his regular race prep for the Belmont.""So much energy right here,"" he said. ""It would kind of build you up right here. It's like good energy drinks.""""The resting place of a righteous person is considered a sacred place,"" said Rabbi Motti Seligson of Chabad.org.American Pharoah, whose owner is an observant Jew, went on to win the Belmont.Chabad is known worldwide for its outreach to fellow Jews and its positive outlook. In his lifetime, the Rebbe encouraged non-Jews to observe the Seven Noahide Laws as universal moral principles (via Chabad.org):THE 7 LAWS1
Acknowledge that there is only one G-d who is Infinite and Supreme above all things. Do not replace that Supreme Being with finite idols, be it yourself, or other beings. This command includes such acts as prayer, study and meditation.2
Respect the Creator. As frustrated and angry as you may be, do not vent it by cursing your Maker.3
Respect human life. Every human being is an entire world. To save a life is to save that entire world. To destroy a life is to destroy an entire world. To help others live is a corollary of this principle.4
Respect the institution of marriage. Marriage is a most Divine act. The marriage of a man and a woman is a reflection of the oneness of G-d and His creation. Disloyalty in marriage is an assault on that oneness.5
Respect the rights and property of others. Be honest in all your business dealings. By relying on G-d rather than on our own conniving, we express our trust in Him as the Provider of Life.6
Respect G-d's creatures. At first, Man was forbidden to consume meat. After the Great Flood, he was permitted - but with a warning: Do not cause unnecessary suffering to any creature.7
Maintain justice. Justice is G-d's business, but we are given the charge to lay down necessary laws and enforce them whenever we can. When we right the wrongs of society, we are acting as partners in the act of sustaining the creation.Ivanka Trump converted to Orthodox Judaism prior to marrying Kushner.Joel B.

Meadows on â€˜Whatever It Takesâ€™: Congress Canâ€™t Stop Piling Pork Spending on Vital Bills, â€˜No Crisis Goes Unpunishedâ€™	"One of the leaders of House conservatives told Curt Schilling, the host of Whatever It Takes, that unless the Congress gets a handle on pork spending, the budget crisis in Washington will never be solved.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""The biggest threat that we have to our national security is that we will not be able to fund our military-we will not be able to fund our Medicare and Social Security,"" said Rep. Mark Meadows (R.-N.C.), who led the fight to oust Speaker John A. Boehner in the summer of 2015.
Call into the show: (877) 240-1776Schilling asked the congressman how it happens that he and other conservatives voted against a bill that would have helped the survivors from Hurricane Sandy.Meadows, who was born in France into a military family and grew up in Florida, said like so many well-intentioned bills, the Sandy relief bill was loaded up with so many other spending projects, including a fish hatchery in Alaska.""It is like no crisis goes unpunished,"" he said. ""Any time you have an event, whether it is Hurricane Sandy or we just had Hurricane Matthew in North Carolina, everybody wants to start adding on their pet projects.""The congressman said people always talk about reforms, but he says it is too tempting to try to put something on a bill you know will pass because it is to fund something that is really important, such as veterans.Plus, it is too easy to get a bum rap when you vote against an abuse of the process, but people assume you voted against the stated purpose of the bill, he said.""That's how we get in this mess and that's how we're going to end up bankrupting our country,"" he said.Schilling: ""How do we fix that?""Meadows said the challenge is trying to return to the normal process of legislating and budgeting.Bills that go through the normal committee process are not as easily hijacked by special interests, he said.""What we need to do is to make sure appropriations are exactly for what it is supposed to do,"" he said. ""There is an understanding that appropriations bills for each section of the government--they are focused and without policy riders or unrelated funding measures.""There are proposals that would limit funding bills to one purpose or one agency, he said. ""That has not picked up a lot of steam. A lot of people believe it intellectually we should do it, but they are just are not there.""One of the problems is that with an issue such as veterans, there are different programs and departments involved, so it is not always practicable, Meadows said.History shows that reforming the budget system is a lot harder than going along with it, the congressman said.Join host Curt Schilling weekdays from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. for Whatever It Takes broadcast online at Breitbart.com.SIGN UP"

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERHe was barred from entering the United States, in addition to paying the largest penalty in the history of campaign finance violations. An email disclosed by WikiLeaks demonstrates that Riady is still feeding money into the Clinton machine.Riady, head of the Lippo banking conglomerate, entered a felony plea in 2001 stating that he ""knowingly and willfully conspired and agreed to defraud the United States by impairing, obstructing and defeating the lawful functions and duties of the FEC through deceitful and dishonest means.""Riady's lawyers played up his voluntary cooperation with the U.S. justice system, noting that he could have avoided prosecution as an Indonesian citizen, because there was no extradition treaty between Indonesia and the U.S. They pointed fingers of blame at a Lippo California official whose name is also well-known to veterans of the Nineties scandal wars, John Huang, and said Riady had merely reimbursed Huang for funds illegally pumped into Democratic political campaigns, prominently including Bill Clinton's 1992 White House bid.The L.A. Times summarized the relationship between the Riadys, Huang, the Lippo Group, and the Clintons in a January 2001 article about James Riady's guilty plea:Mochtar Riady, the family patriarch, and his son James have known Clinton for more than 20 years, since they were investors in a Little Rock, Ark., bank and Clinton was governor. During Clinton's first term as president, James Riady visited the White House at least 20 times.The Riadys helped place Huang at the Commerce Department in 1994 and then at the Democratic National Committee. As a DNC official, Huang helped raise $3.4 million from the Asian American community, more than half of which ultimately was returned because DNC officials could not verify that it came from legal, domestic donors.The Riady family, its companies and their associates gave the Democratic Party more than $840,000 from 1992 through 1996.Foreign corporations and non-citizens aren't supposed to make those kinds of donations, which is one reason the Clintons developed their alternative funding system of giving ridiculously overpriced speeches to foreign entities, and using their enormous Clinton Foundation financial apparatus to digest overseas money.Another legendary name from Nineties scandalmania was tangled up in the Riady scandal: Webb Hubbell. As the L.A. Times wrote:The Riady family and its companies also were connected to Clinton friend and onetime Associate Atty. Gen. Webster L. Hubbell. One of the companies controlled by James Riady made a $100,000 payment to Hubbell, who after leaving the Justice Department under an ethics cloud served 18 months in federal prison for defrauding the Rose Law Firm of Little Rock when he and Hillary Rodham Clinton were partners there.As a result of his plea agreement, James Riady was barred from traveling to the United States for at least two years, and agreed to perform 400 hours of community service, while the Lippo Group paid a groundbreaking $8.6 million fine.There was more than just money involved in the Riady/Lippo debacle, as there have long been suspicions the Chinese government was involved, using Lippo's donations to buy access to American missile technology. There's no question China got the technology it wanted; in a phrase that will sound familiar after WikiLeaks documented the special treatment Clinton Foundation donors received from Hillary Clinton's State Department, it was the ""quid pro quo"" that could never be proven. Some believe Riady's plea-bargain agreement was a successful effort to stonewall a more serious investigation. The deal was signed less than two weeks before George W. Bush became President.Riady made it back onto American soil in 2009, with a visit to Arkansas that was kept quiet. As the Washington Post reported in 2010: ""Riady's return to the United States poses a prickly question for Hillary Clinton's State Department: How and why did a foreign billionaire stained by Clinton-era scandals get a U.S. visa after being kept out for so long under the Bush administration?""The short answer is that some career people at the State Department were very uncomfortable with Riady visiting the U.S. and refreshing his ties to the Clinton power structure, but apparently no one could come up with a solid reason to stop him, his travel ban having technically expired around 2004. According to what Riady told the Washington Post, the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta recommended the Department of Homeland Security give him a waiver to obtain a six-month visitor's visa in late 2008, nominally to attend ""family graduation ceremonies,"" and DHS ""concurred."" Interestingly, no one involved in this process seemed very eager to discuss their decision-making process. The State Department insisted that Secretary of State Clinton was unaware of his visits.Riady's second visit to the U.S. was hardly limited to ""family graduation ceremonies."" Among other things, he registered for a New York meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative, a meeting which both Hillary Clinton and President Obama attended. He told the Post he didn't actually attend the meeting because he couldn't fit it into his schedule.He did, however, pay $20,000 to become a member of the Clinton Global Initiative. And now comes the WikiLeaks revelation that, according to a December 2012 email from the Clinton Foundation, Riady is funding a ""retrofit program in Indonesia"" with the Foundation's Asia Climate Group. This information is part of a financial statement for Clinton Foundation board members attached to the email.This email was sent to Clinton's campaign CEO John Podesta and her chief of staff Cheryl Mills, among others, so it will be interesting to watch Hillary Clinton claim she was completely unaware of Riady's involvement.Incidentally, Riady, who is now about 58-years-old, is very outspokenly Christian. His response to the Washington Post's 2010 questions about his under-the-radar visits to the United States included assurances that ""the teachings of Christ inform all that I do."" He is noted for making sizable donations to the small Christian community in Muslim-majority Jakarta. He's very particular about how his plea agreement did not include any confessions of deliberate immoral behavior. On the other hand, he has a long reputation as a very aggressive businessman, whose sense of Christian morality doesn't seem to complicate his business practices much. He was described as ""Jekyll and Hyde,"" a ""God-fearing Christian"" in the robber-baron tradition of John D. Rockefeller, to the Washington Post by one of his friends.There is an old saying that if you mix an ounce of sewage with a gallon of ice cream, the result is a gallon of sewage. The Clinton Foundation operates on the reverse of that principle, sanctifying all kinds of suspicious financial arrangements by inserting a little dash of charity. If you ask tough questions about what the Foundation does with most of its money, you must be a monster who hates the poor souls the Clinton Foundation is trying to help.

Trump is dead.
GOP in big trouble in #nvsen, two House seats and #nvleg control.https://t.co/1pS7nvPBhm-- Jon Ralston (@RalstonReports) November 5, 2016If Latino votes end up denying Trump the White House, Democrats would likely see the result as poetic justice, and look forward to passing immigration reform -- in a form that most Republicans would consider ""amnesty."" But the result could also create broader political instability.The present immigration debate is not primarily about legal immigration -- though Democrats have tried to frame it as such. Rather, the debate is about illegal immigration, and what to do with millions of illegal aliens (no one knows the precise number) living in the country.Moreover, the Democrats' election message to Latinos has focused on defending the interests of illegal aliens. They have also used illegal aliens at every level of their campaign, including registering U.S. citizens to vote.In addition, Democrats have led the effort to defy existing federal immigration law, through sanctuary cities and other policies.While new revelations on corruption and Obamacare have boosted Trump, those issues may not be of particular interest to Latino voters.The political culture of many Latin American societies accepts a certain level of endemic corruption as a fact of life. And Obamacare has benefited many of the poorest Latinos, who are eligible for health insurance through the expansion of Medicaid. (In California, the state is petitioning the federal government to allow illegal aliens to be eligible as well.)The idea that a major policy question like immigration law would be settled, in part, on behalf of those who are not actually Americans, and through the efforts of those who have helped them defy the law, will raise major questions about whether the result is just, even if the result is technically legitimate. Many Republicans will likely question the legitimacy of the result as well.From the point of view of social stability, the best political solution to the immigration puzzle is to have a President Trump pass immigration reform, in a Nixon-to-China gesture that involves significant compromise by both sides.Republicans would have their ""wall,"" and a guarantee that border security will come before legalization. Democrats would have their pathway to citizenship, likely guaranteeing that most of today's illegal aliens would be tomorrow's citizens, and likely voting Democratic as well.It would be better (though, from a Republican perspective, bad for other reasons) for Trump to lose by a landslide, in which Latino votes were only a small part of a larger story, than to lose by a narrow margin because of the Latino vote.The worst-case scenario is one that might unfold if the Nevada result foretells a narrow win for Hillary Clinton on the basis of Latino turnout alone, because then any immigration policy changes that follow might be seen as illegal aliens imposing their will on citizens.The tragedy of immigration policy in the U.S. is that there is one solution that is politically acceptable to the vast majority of Americans, though imperfect. It is border security first, followed by a path to citizenship once border security has been confirmed. Republicans generally want to put this issue behind them.Democrats have deliberately frustrated the obvious solution in order to preserve the immigration issue for presidential elections -- i.e. for precisely this moment.The counter-argument to the above is familiar-- that Republicans would deserve to lose for choosing candidates in two successive elections that take hard stances against illegal immigration.But the answer to that is what happened to Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) in 2008, and what is happening to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) now. Democrats attack even Republicans who are allies on immigration. They want surrender, not compromise.The news from Nevada could thus portend trouble for Trump, and division for America.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Tim Kaine (D-VA) still can't unite her party. Supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, her Democratic primary rival, are disrupting her campaign's efforts to take on GOP nominee Donald J. Trump, and in Iowa on Saturday one prominent Sanders backer was actually escorted out of a Clinton campaign event for urging those present not to vote for Clinton--for which he was cheered by the crowd.Kaleb Vanfosson, the president of Iowa State University's Students for Bernie chapter, bashed Hillary Clinton and told rally-goers at her own campaign event not to vote for her. He was cheered.He opened his remarks by bashing Donald Trump on student loan debt, but then surprisingly turned to bashing Hillary Clinton from her own stage. ""Unfortunately, Hillary doesn't really care about this issue either,"" Vanfosson said. ""The only thing she cares about is pleasing her donors, the billionaires who fund her campaign. The only people that really trust Hillary are Goldman Sachs, CitiGroup can trust Hillary, the military industrial complex can trust Hillary. Her good friend Henry Kissinger can trust Hillary.""The crowd at the Clinton-Kaine event erupted in applause.""She is so trapped in the world of the elite that she has completely lost grip on what it's like to be an average person,"" Vanfosson continued. ""She doesn't care. Voting for another lesser of two evils, there's no point.""At that point, a Clinton staffer rushed on stage and grabbed the young man by the arm to escort him off the stage and out of the event.WATCH BERNIE SANDERS SUPPORTER BASHING HILLARY CLINTON AT HER OWN RALLYAccording to a student newspaper account, Vanfosson claims he was ""basically assaulted"" by the Clinton staffer on the way out.""Vanfosson told the Iowa State Daily that while being escorted out he was 'basically assaulted,'"" Iowa State Daily's Shannon McCarty wrote. ""Vanfosson said he does have footage of the incident.""After this whole incident, Sanders himself came out to give his own speech in support of Clinton.

The office windows were also painted over.Some of the vandalism included the words ""pervert"" and ""thief"" and were painted in large block letters on the brick facade of the building.""It's an anti message. We'll investigate it using all the tools we have at our disposal including viewing electronic devices to determine who did this,"" Denver police spokesman Sonny Jackson told the media after the initial attack.A series of attacks on Republican campaign offices have been seen this year. Not long before the first incident in Denver, the office of the Alamance County, North Carolina, Republican Party was vandalized.The Alamance County GOP office is not the only one in North Carolina to be attacked this election season. In mid-October the GOP office in Hillsborough, North Carolina, was gutted by a firebomb. After the incident, local Republicans accused the Obama-controlled Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) of attempting to cover up the political motivations behind the attack with its investigation into the incident.In addition to the attacks noted above, Donald Trump's new hotel in Washington D.C. suffered vandalism when slogans such as ""No Justice No Peace"" and ""Black Lives Matter"" were painted on its walls.The GOP nominee's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was also attacked by a pick-wielding liberal who destroyed the marker on October 26.

Just prior to Director Comey's October 28 announcement that the FBI had opened a new investigation into Hillary Clinton's email scandal, Giuliani had said that a ""big surprise"" was about to come out of the FBI.Giuliani went on to say that he had heard from individual FBI agents that there was ""tremendous anger"" inside the Bureau over Comey's July decision not to recommend that the Department of Justice indict Hillary for her obvious violations of our national security laws. Rudy was hardly alone in mentioning these rumblings, as there were many stories in the media relating that anger.But as he told Fusion.com, Kaine insisted Rudy's words somehow ""proved"" that Comey and the FBI were working directly with the Republicans to destroy Hillary.Calling the Bureau ""a leaky sieve,"" Kaine went on to criticize the FBI as a mean political player.""What's come out since,"" Kaine told Fusion.com, ""suggests that it's probably more likely explained that [Giuliani] knew that the FBI is not only a leaky sieve, but there were people within the FBI actively working -- actively working -- to try to help the Trump campaign. This just absolutely staggering, and it is a massive blow to the integrity of [the FBI]."" Kaine also said Comey felt pressured to release information about the new investigation or risk subordinates doing so if he did not.Kaine presented no proof for this ""actively working"" accusation.Of course, this is a startling accusation in light of the universal praise Democrats lavished on Comey and the FBI when they felt the director had cleared Clinton of wrongdoing in her email scandal.Tim Kaine himself even called Director Comey a ""wonderful"" public servant after he seemed to clear Clinton in July.In fact, only days before Comey's announcement of a renewed investigation, Kaine was seen heaping praise on the FBI director.""What I do know is this,"" Kaine told Fox News host Bret Baier on October 16, ""there was an extensive investigation by the FBI under the direction of a wonderful and tough career public servant, Jim Comey. Jim was in the U.S. Attorny's Office in the Eastern District of Virginia when I was the mayor of Richmond and he's somebody with the highest standards of integrity.""Despite that recent praise, Kaine is now attacking the FBI and Director Comey.Yet, even as Kaine trashed the FBI as a political saboteur, later in the same Fusion.com interview he attacked Donald Trump for ""trashing the democratic institutions in this country"" with his campaign trail claims that the ""system is rigged"" against Republicans.""Donald Trump, at the end, is trashing the democratic institutions in this country, saying that we can't run a fair election, saying that he may not respect the outcome of the election demonstrates a deep and profound misunderstanding of the system we have,"" Kaine said.

""So I deal with it.""Some insurance plans under Obamacare are designed not to kick in until patients have spent thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs, which put many healthcare services out of reach for patients.Even though the uninsured rate in America is at a record low, a study from the Commonwealth Fund found that four out of 10 adults in Obamacare plans aren't confident that they can pay their medical bills if they got sick, Bloomberg Politics reported.""A lot of people are still one catastrophic illness away from really feeling the financial impact of this,"" said Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill.

The email chain makes clear that Clinton and Sanders had a no-punching agreement right from the get-go.A reporter asked a campaign official about a statement that Sanders made lightly criticizing the Clintons. Sanders reportedly said, ""I'm not going to condemn Hillary and Bill Clinton because they've made a lot of money. That type of wealth has the potential to isolate you from the reality of the world.""Team Clinton was not happy.""Are we just declining comment on all these?"" one staffer asked others.Clinton staffer Christina Reynolds alerted numerous top players in the Clinton campaign:Following up on our call on Friday, just wanted to give some updates and flag that Bernie went after HRC and WJC on wealth (including using the word ""hustle.)

Clinton and Republican Donald J. Trump, according to the Breitbart/Gravis national poll conducted Nov. 1 and Nov. 2 with 2,435 registered voters.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""Our poll shows Clinton at 47 percent and Trump at 45 percent, which is at our margin of error,"" said Doug Kaplan, the managing partner of Gravis Marketing, the Florida-based polling company that executed the poll. The poll carries a margin of error of two percent with a 95 percent level of confidence. Libertarian Gary Johnson has the support of three percent with Green Party nominee Dr. Jill Stein the choice of one percent, he said.Kaplan said, ""Every four years, there is a surge at the end by the Republican nominee, like muscle memory kicking in that in some years is enough and some is not.""Democratic pollster Patrick Caddell said the election is still up for grabs with up to 12 percent of the electorate still ""floating"" between the two candidates.These floaters include up to 20 percent of Clinton's own supporters, who have developed a split personality-supporting the former first lady personally, but agreeing with Trump, he said""The whole country is in motion and states in play are going all together,"" he said.Trump is not doing what Caddell has said to Breitbart News or other outlets that he must do, he said: ""He needs to go to the American people and make the case that this is a referendum election.""If Trump makes the election a personality or character contest between him and Clinton, he will lose, Caddell said.Both candidates have almost the same unfavorable ratings, so it is a wash there, but the head-to-head contest obscures the solid alignment of Trump and the voters on the important issues, such as trade, refugees, immigration, and the idea that an elite has been running the country for their own benefit, he said.""His closing two minutes is good,"" Caddell said. ""But he is out there rallying his base-and this is more than a base election.""The momentum is with Trump, and there is no comparison with the weaker momentum of Republican W. Mitt Romney that stalled in 2012 in the last days of his campaign against President Barack Obama, when Hurricane Sandy made landfall on New Jersey Oct. 29, just over a week before the Nov. 6 election, he said.""Romney's momentum was never this great, let's get that straight,"" he said. ""They had thrown that election away-hurricane or no hurricane-there was nothing like we are seeing now in terms of volatility, the anti-establishmentism and the protest voting,"" he said.In addition to their presidential preference, poll participants were asked a series of policy and attitudinal questions to gauge the mood of the electorate.Caddell said one of the most important results in the poll was the response to the question as to whether the ""Political Elite and Special Interests""  win or lose if Trump or Clinton win or lose.In the general sample population, 65 percent of respondents said ""Political Elite and Special Interests"" win if Clinton wins and 35 percent said they lose if the former first lady takes the White House. If Trump wins, 43 percent said  ""Political Elite and Special Interests"" win and 57 percent said they lose.Caddell said that inside the segments of the sample population, among people with a single college degree, 66 percent said the elites win when Clinton wins, and it was also the response of 58 percent of people with advanced degrees.This alignment with the Trump voters among voters that are supposed to be hostile to Trump is very significant, he said.""This is the argument that could move the election"" he said.""If the voters to go into the booth on the basis of just personal qualifications, Trump is disadvantaged. But, if they go and vote based on whether or not they are concerned that Hillary Clinton is under investigation-and if the closing case is that how America is supposed to be ruled? Then, Trump could win-and win by a lot.""Asked: ""Why do you think FBI Director James Comey chose to reopen the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while Secretary of State after the agency recently uncovered thousands of emails on the laptop used by Clinton's closest adviser?"" fifty-seven percent of participants said Comey believed that he found something significant and 43 percent said Comey was trying to influence the outcome of the election.Asked: ""How concerned are you that if Hillary Clinton were elected President her current controversies and scandals will continue to be a central focus of her Presidency and detract from her ability to lead the country?"" Sixty percent said they were concerned, which is combination of 47 percent saying ""Very Concerned"" and 13 percent saying ""Concerned."" Nineteen percent said they were ""Not Very Concerned"" and 19 percent ""Not Concerned At All.""Fifty-six percent said the FBI's reboot of its investigation will have no effect on their vote, while 21 percent said it was  ""More Likely"" to affect their vote and 22 percent said it would be ""Less Likely"" to have that effect.Participants were asked three questions dealing with the issue of whether Clinton would be pardoned.Asked: ""Should President Obama publicly announce before the election that if Hillary Clinton is elected, he will not pardon her for any crimes prior to the election?"" Forty-one percent said the president should make that pledge and 34 percent said he should not.Forty-one percent of respondents said Clinton should announce that she will not accept a pardon from the president, but 31 percent said she should not.Forty-eight percent said Clinton should announce that if she is elected president, she will not pardon herself and 31 percent said she should not.Participants were also asked questions to determine whether there is a consensus for change.Fifty-four percent of the respondents said the county is going in the ""Wrong Direction"" and 40 percent said the country is going in the ""Right Direction.""Similarly, 54 percent of the respondents said they want the next president to ""change the direction and pursue new policies"" and 41 percent want the next president to ""continue the policies of Barack Obama.""When they were asked: ""Has Obamacare been a success?"" Fifty-three percent said ""Yes"" and 36 percent said ""No.""The poll was conducted using interactive voice response polling and an internet panel of cell phone users with results weighted to match a proprietary turnout model.The party breakdown of participants is: 46 percent Democrat, 38 percent Republican, and 16 percent Other.Thirty-seven percent of respondents said they had already voted, 11 percent said they would vote before Election Day and 51 percent said they would vote Election Day.U.S. (November 3, 2016) v1 (1) by Breitbart News on ScribdSIGN UP"
