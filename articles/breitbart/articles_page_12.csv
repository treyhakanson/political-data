Everything the voters rejected,"" Savage tells Breitbart News. ""He will steer Trump away from every policy we sent him to D.C. to change. He is the enemy within. He is [Paul] Ryan, [Mitch] McConnell, and the Old Guard. They do not want change. 'Out with the old, in with the new.'""A close Ryan ally, Priebus was responsible for the GOP ""autopsy"" following the Romney-Ryan loss of 2012. One of its conclusions held that, to win elections, Republicans must embrace an immigration agenda that would import future voters who tend to overwhelmingly support Democrat policies. The Priebus manifesto argued against opposing amnesty and appealing to the Republican electorate's ""core constituency.""""We must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform. If we do not, our Party's appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only,"" the Priebus report stated.By contrast, for years Savage has argued that Republican candidates should run campaigns on ""borders, language, and culture.""""I call him 'Rinse,'"" Savage said of Priebus, adding that's ""what Trump should do with his advice.""Savage's talk radio show, which is one of the most listened-to talk radio programs in the country, reaches an audience over 20 million listeners and is syndicated by over some 400 stations nationwide.

Trump's historic upset, Speaker Ryan is now telling voters that he will not enact a central part of Trump's ""mandate"" given to him by the American people: namely, Trump's repeated pledge to enforce U.S. immigration law and to allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to do its job by removing people in the country illegally.""We are not planning on erecting a deportation force. Donald Trump's not planning on that,"" Ryan told CNN's Jake Tapper on State of the Union.""I think we should put people's minds at ease: That is not what our focus is. That is not what we're focused on. We're focused on securing the border. We think that's first and foremost, before we get into any other immigration issue, we've got to know who's coming and going into the country- we've got to secure the border,"" Ryan said.Yet, as Vice President-elect Mike Pence explained during the Vice Presidential debate the nation already has a ""deportation force"".""We have a deportation force. It is called Immigrations and Customs Enforcement,"" Pence said, and ""for the first time in their history, their union endorsed Donald Trump to be the next President of the United States.""Indeed, the ICE union backed Trump, in part, because he pledged that he would allow ICE to do its job and enforce U.S. immigration law.""We are going to triple the number of ICE deportation officers,"" Trump said during his Arizona immigration speech. ""Within ICE, I am going to create a new special Deportation Task Force, focused on identifying and removing quickly the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice.""Interestingly, while the National ICE Council endorsed Trump for President, the council's president has had strong words for Speaker Ryan in the past.""[A]s House Speaker, you have not spoken out about any of the issues confronting our officers or the threat to public safety presented by the lawless immigration policies of the Obama Administration... your office has not reached out to us in any way,"" the President of the ICE Council wrote in an August letter to Ryan.""Foreign nationals flood across the border because they have been led to believe that if they make it here, they can stay. I am sorry to say that your rhetoric could be adding to that perception,"" the ICE president wrote to Ryan. ""While specific members of Congress have been vocal in standing up for our officers and fighting to defend law and order, we have not felt that same support from the Speaker's office.""""ICE officers have... been disturbed to hear some of the recent comments made by the Republican House Speaker,"" the ICE Council President added. ""Your 2015 spending bill funded sanctuary cities, the resettlement of illegal alien border crossers, the release of criminal aliens and executive amnesty--policies which jeopardize the safety and security of the American people.""While reports have documented that the border surge is currently the worst it's ever been, the ICE Council president said that as House Speaker, Ryan has pushed policies that would only ""exacerbate the situation"":In the nine months that you have served as House Speaker, I am not aware of you holding a single press conference devoted exclusively to addressing this national crisis. Indeed, we were disheartened to learn that instead, the House Speaker intends to push and fund policies, which we believe would only exacerbate the situation.In the letter, the National ICE Council demanded a meeting with Speaker Ryan. Yet Ryan never responded and never met with the council's president.By contrast, Donald Trump reached out and met with the nation's ICE officers to discuss how to keep America safe.""It was extremely clear that this guy is on law enforcement's side,"" said the nation's ICE Council president said after the meeting in August.  ""[Trump] made no bones about it--he wants the rule of law followed in our country, and he wants to make America safe... He made clear he's on the side of law and order, and is on the side of the American public.""Similarly, when grieving mothers, who were forced to bury their loved ones as a result of illegal alien crime, tried to meet with Ryan, the Speaker of the House literally fled from them.Ryan ""doesn't care [about our families] one bit,"" said Laura Wilkerson, whose 18-year-old son was tied up, beaten, strangled, set on fire, and tortured to death by his illegal alien classmate.By contrast, Trump met with these families and said, ""of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more deeply than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border.""These mothers and fathers have said that Donald Trump was the first presidential candidate to ever make them ""feel heard"".""Paul Ryan is personally responsible for the deaths, maimings, and sexual assaults of thousands of innocent Americans and lawful residents,"" the grieving angel moms wrote in August.""Paul Ryan has never shown one millionth the passion in defense of our families as he has spent advocating for policies that would result in the deaths of more Americans... [He] has the blood of so many on his hands--blacks, whites, Asians, Hispanics, immigrants, and children of immigrants... If Ryan's considerable powers had been marshaled, in any serious degree, towards advocating for our families, demanding change for our families, or insisting upon justice for our families, then so many more families just like us would have been saved. For all of these reasons and more, we deem Ryan disqualified from serving in Congress or any other position of public office that is supposed to represent the American people.""Throughout the campaign, Ryan repeatedly made statements that seemed designed to undermine Trump's candidacy. Now that Trump has won, Ryan's comments seem to underscore conservatives' concerns that Ryan as House Speaker will not only refuse to help Trump enact the mandate given to him by the American people, but he will also work to actively undermine that mandate- for instance, by not making enforcing U.S. immigration law a ""focus"" of a Trump administration.As Ed Martin, Phyllis Schlafly's hand-picked successor and president of her Eagle Forum Education and Legal Defense Fund, told Breitbart News:On Tuesday, November 8, the American voters showed conclusively that Paul Ryan is not the leader for this moment in our history.  The message is clear: Ryan's judgment was rejected! [...] Now is the time to move forward on the Trump agenda, not back to the failed Ryan policies. [...] Paul Ryan should yield to a new Republican leader whose policy positions and political judgment are in line with the Trump Republican Party.It is unclear whether members of the House Freedom Caucus and conservative lawmakers--including Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows, Jeff Duncan, Jim Bridenstine, Mo Brooks, Brian Babin, Steve King, Matt Salmon, Alex Mooney, Gary Palmer, Barry Loudermilk, John Fleming and others--who voted for Ryan last year will vote to elect him again as House Speaker.According to Pew polling data, Paul Ryan's expansionist agenda on immigration stands opposed to more than 9 in 10 GOP voters.Republican lawmakers are set to hold leadership elections this coming Tuesday, November 15.In the nine months that you have served as House Speaker, I am not aware of you holding a single press conference devoted exclusively to addressing this national crisis. Indeed, we were disheartened to learn that instead, the House Speaker intends to push and fund policies, which we believe would only exacerbate the situation.""Paul Ryan has never shown one millionth the passion in defense of our families as he has spent advocating for policies that would result in the deaths of more Americans...

Roger Williams for NRCC Chairman ‘Open and Shut Case’	"The leader of the American Conservative Union told Breitbart News he is supporting Rep. Roger Williams (R.-Texas) to be the next leader of the National Republican Congressional Committee, the political wing for House Republicans.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""The American Conservative Union feels it is very important that the leadership table includes conservatives. Roger Williams, in our opinion is one of the leading conservatives in Congress-having him around that leadership table will be very important-having someone around that leadership table, who has never wavered in his support for our nominee Donald Trump is very important,"" said Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the ACU.Schlapp said Williams has a rating with the American Conservative Union of 100 percent in 2014 and 96 percent in 2015.The Texas congressman is running against Ohio's Rep. Steve Stivers, whose 2014 and 2015 scores were 63 and 54, respectively. Stivers is the deputy chairman of the NRCC and an ally of the current outgoing chairman, Oregon's Rep. Greg Walden.""If you look at the two sets of scores, you can see why it is an open and shut case for ACU,"" he said.""Roger has a much, much better record,"" Schlapp said.""I've known Roger Williams for 16 years,"" said Schlapp, who met Williams when the two men worked to elect Texas Gov. George W. Bush president in 2000. At the time, Williams was a key fundraiser for the Bush campaign, a role he played in the Bush's 1994 and 1998 runs for governor and in President Bush's 2004 reelection campaign.Schlapp said he developed a strong bond with Williams, when the former minor league pitcher was the Texas secretary of state ramping up for a Senate run in 2012. Williams instead ran for Congress where he represents a north-south drawn district between Austin and Fort Worth.It is important to appreciate that Williams was an early and unwavering supporter of President-elect Donald J. Trump, Schlapp added.""I talked to Roger early about Trump and when it looked like he was going to get the nomination and he never wavered,"" he said. ""Even though, he has friendships with the Bush family, and others, too.""The whole way, when others were not solid, Williams was solid, he said.""I've never regretted stepping forward for Roger,"" he said. ""He's a campaign pro, who's run for office himself, as everyone up for NRCC has, but he has been around the operations of campaigns for decades and he has been at the side of the people, who write the big checks, who raise the big checks.""There is a tendency with politicians to hand over control of a campaign to the professionals, Schlapp continued. ""But, in Roger's case, he has an understanding of how the money 'should' be spent and I think he has a very innovative plan to change the way the NRCC has always done business.""The NRCC has not kept up with the way campaigns and campaign communication are handled in today's politics.""The Trump victory shows us that many Republican operatives are playing from a playbook that is a generation old and ineffective,"" Schlapp said. ""Roger is open to the idea that politics is not a stagnant operation.""Schlapp said he likes that Williams promised to keep the NRCC out of primaries. In the past, the NRCC has put its thumb on the scale for candidates in the primaries, who end up being less conservative.""I have been involved in these conversations through the cycles-should they be involved? should they not be involved?-the problem with the NRCC is that they fall in love with self-funded candidates, who more often than not tend to be philosophically much softer-they love self-funders because they have to spend less.""The job of a national party's committee is to pull people together and make sure the best candidates are supported, but when a committee tied to the national party, like the NRCC, plays in a primary, it creates bitterness and alienation, he said.""The NRCC's job is not to be the leading voice on ideology, but that can be so abused and I have seen past chairmen, where they almost always get involved in primaries to help the candidate that represents the quote-unquote business interests-right? and which is usually the euphemism for being a moderate.""It is okay that the GOP is a party of moderates and conservatives, he said.""But, the heart and soul of the party is the conservative activists,"" he said. ""When the party doesn't stand for that the party starts to have big trouble and I think Roger understands that very well-yes, we want Republicans from all over the country, and that means cities and towns and rural areas-but, the heart and soul of the party should never be changed and the heart and soul really spoke up in the last election.""Williams knows what he knows and like Trump he is full of energy, Schlapp said.""Roger never stops, that is why he is so successful in business, that's why he has so many friends, it's why he is such a good fundraiser,"" he concluded.SIGN UP"

The bill becoming law made New York the final state among the 50 to sanction the young sport.Longtime New York state assembly speaker Sheldon Silver blocked MMA legalization for years. But his arrest and conviction on public corruption charges imprisoned the speaker and freed up log-jammed legislation.A grudge against the open-shop policies of a casino chain owned by the former owners of the UFC strangely migrated from Nevada to New York to prevent MMA from holding professional events in the state. Silver's alliance with organized labor meant that any proposed bill to give the sport the state's imprimatur never received an up-or-down vote.""The reason MMA is not sanctioned in New York is because there is a lot of money from the culinary unions who have an old grudge with the Fertittas about Station Casinos not using the culinary unions in Las Vegas,"" Urijah Faber told Breitbart Sports at a UFC 169 presser strategically held in Madison Square Garden almost four years ago. ""It's corrupt. It's wrong. It's something that everyone should be ashamed of if you're a part of it.""Saturday night's Madison Square Garden event witnessed the Empire State debut of several New York-area natives, including Long Islander Chris Weidman. He entered the octagon Saturday night to the opening bars of Billy Joel's ""New York State of Mind"" before it transitioned into several other songs.""It would be an absolute dream come true,"" Weidman told Breitbart Sports two years ago about fighting in Madison Square Garden. ""I'm working really hard fighting all around the world. [Mixed-martial arts] is legal pretty much everywhere else in the world. That it's not in my home state is disheartening.

A back-and-forth Tyron Woodley-Stephen Thompson draw and Joanna Jedrzejczyk decisioning a tough Karolina Kowalkiewicz similarly elevated the event.

""In part this is because problems and pain sell advertising space. Mass communications has always struggled with that balance between fair reporting, personal bias, and pressure from executives to keep things 'hot.'""He noted that people were responding negatively to anti-Trump images on television and social media.""When we read, we can rationally discuss the issues or definitions of terms at hand. When we see pictures, however, a different part of our brain is engaged.""That part is the limbic brain, a part also activated in stressful situations, because it is key to survival. This is the most primitive and unevolved part of us. It acts on emotion, is irrational, childish, and afraid. It can be rude and boorish, and sometimes even cruel,"" he said.Sulack notes that many voters are also upset because they feel ""hopeless and powerless."" To deal with the stress, he recommends avoiding alcohol and caffeine, and instead eating dark chocolate, ""tree nuts or nut butters,"" and ""kale and other leafy, green vegetables.""Teen mental health expert Jamison Monroe, Founder and CEO of Newport Academy, says that while the media are fueling some of the anxiety, much of it comes from information shared by peers through social media.""Media greatly influences people's thoughts and opinions. However, teens are very influenced by their peer groups, so reading their peers' political opinions on social platforms has just as much influence, for this is where a majority of millennials get their news from,"" he told Breitbart News, via email.He explained that feelings of stress were not just triggered by the election result, but the entire campaign. ""Feelings of distress are now heighted due to the snowball effect of emotions throughout the entire election,"" he said.For the distressed, Monroe recommended meditating, and avoiding social media altogether.""Many people post their thoughts about the election on social media, and election posts currently make up most people's news feeds,"" he said.Joel B.

On his Facebook page, Bunting posted:Read article. NOM, a recognized HATE GROUP by the Southern Poverty Law Center, is not representative of the key pillars of American society. They seek to limit life. Limit liberty. Limit Freedom. Limit the pursuit of happiness for million of American [sic]. If you agree with them then that is your opinion. Just know that to the rest of us, you are a piece of worthless trash.This article Bunting referenced was from the blog of NOM: the National Organization for Marriage. NOM's president is a devout Roman Catholic, and the organization is staffed by individuals who share a deeply religious belief that marriage is between one man and one woman.Bunting is citing material from the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), an ultra-left anti-Christian organization that has labeled dozens of conservative organizations as ""hate groups,"" including faith-based groups like the Family Research Council (FRC), immigration groups like the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), and various Tea Party groups.SPLC explicitly equates such conservative organizations with the racist Ku Klux Klan (KKK). SPLC also posts maps to their offices, one of which was used by Floyd Lee Corkins in 2012 to enter FRC's office in Washington, D.C., with a firearm and more than 50 rounds of ammunition. Corkins shot the office manager, and planned to assassinate everyone in the building. He was disarmed by the wounded manager, and later was convicted of domestic terrorism. Corkins is currently serving a 25-year prison sentence. SPLC never apologized, and continues to post maps with directions to the offices of conservative organizations it calls hate groups.Decades ago SPLC was a leading organization on identifying and combating racism. But in recent years its views are so extreme that even the Obama administration stopped using their material for military and anti-terrorism training.GMU is a state university, making it part of the Commonwealth of Virginia. As such, it is bound by the First Amendment's guarantees that the government will not oppose student applicants for exercising their rights to free speech and religious liberty. Those rights apply with full force to the university through the Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment.The First Amendment forbids viewpoint discrimination, which is when, for any particular issue, the government cannot take sides in favor of one viewpoint over another. For example, on the topic of abortion, the government cannot say it will allow pro-abortion statements but frown upon pro-life statements.The Supreme Court has held that the government can decide which views it wants to promote and adopt. But when it comes to private citizens expressing their personal views on politics or religion, the government cannot penalize citizens with whom someone representing the government disagrees.More than that, employers are legally liable for the actions taken by their employees when those employees are carrying out their job duties within the context of their employment.Taken together, in this situation, that means if Bunting plays a role in denying admission into GMU's freshman class a high-school senior because that student expresses Evangelical or Catholic beliefs on marriage or sexuality--or a secular conservative who expresses a conservative political viewpoint on any public issue or applaudes Republican victories on Election Day--then GMU would be violating the First Amendment, and could be sued by that applicant for illegal discrimination.Conservative and religious groups have noted increasing bias against their beliefs at colleges and universities in recent years.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News and earned his law degree from the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) are declaring that they were right to back him in the primary over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, whom party elders said was more ""electable.""SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe aging Vermont socialist mounted a stronger-than-expected challenge nationwide, winning dramatic upsets, packing rallies, and fighting the Democratic primary down to the wire. Now, fans who still ""Feel the Bern"" are complaining anew -- and mounting challenges to seize control of state parties.Politico reports:Supporters of Bernie Sanders' failed presidential bid are seizing on Democratic disarray at the national level to launch a wave of challenges to Democratic Party leaders in the states.The goal is to replace party officials in states where Sanders defeated Hillary Clinton during the acrimonious Democratic primary with more progressive leadership.Sanders supporters are particularly aggrieved that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) colluded with Clinton to block him. Releases of internal DNC emails by Wikileaks in July showed that DNC officials had coordinated with the Clinton campaign. Then-DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned, but her successor, former CNN contributor Donna Brazile, was later shown by Wikileaks to have leaked debate questions to Clinton in advance of primary debates against Sanders.Hundreds of Sanders supporters walked out of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July in a protest dubbed ""#Demexit,"" after what they described as suppression by party officials, including seating non-Sanders delegates in their sections of the Wells Fargo arena, and turning off lights above vociferous delegations such as Washington and Oregon.Now, Sanders fans are circulating articles on social media arguing that Sanders would have beaten Trump. Left-wing journalist Glenn Greenwald -- who is partly responsible for the dramatic Edward Snowden leaks about the National Security Agency -- told Democracy Now: ""Bernie Sanders was a much more popular and a much stronger candidate than Hillary Clinton against every single Republican opponent, including Donald Trump. He was running many points ahead of Clinton on every poll, in terms of who he might run against versus her, in terms of approval rating, in terms of popularity.""Greenwald pointed out that many of the grievances that motivated voters in the Upper Midwest to back Trump were also issues that Sanders had highlighted in his own campaign.Writing in the Washington Post (and reprinted in the San Francisco Chronicle), Fredrik de Boer argues that Sanders was more popular than Clinton and that he could have run a more authentic campaign against Trump: ""Sanders was uniquely positioned to reach voters with a different sensibility. In contrast to the millionaire polish of the Clinton camp, Sanders has a somewhat shambolic, grandfatherly presence that conveys an unpretentious and approachable character.""Joel B.

The Los Angeles Times reports: ""Some were seen being detained downtown on suspicion of vandalism, including one seen spray painting ""my body, my choice"" in the 3rd Street tunnel.""In San Luis Obispo, California, several pro-Trump protesters staged a counter-demonstration -- ""much to some marchers' dismay,"" according to the San Luis Obispo Tribune.""A group of about five people held Trump campaign signs and waved an American flag, marching near the other protesters,"" the Tribune added.Protests have continued throughout the country as Democrats and left-wing activists have rejected the results of last Tuesday's election.In some cases, ordinary thugs appear to be using the political outrage as cover for their independent, violent behavior.Joel B.

Meanwhile, real crimes continue to be committed by anti-Trump rioters in dozens of cities across America.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROne fake ""hate crime"" involved a Muslim woman at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette who claimed that she had her hijab torn off by two white males. Lafayette police now report that she ""admitted that she fabricated the story.""Other incidents are being reported as ""crimes"" that are not crimes at all. CNN published a list of ""hate crimes"" on Saturday that includes an incident where a group of middle school students chanted ""Build the wall!"" in a cafeteria.That is not a ""crime""; it is juvenile behavior by boorish 12- and 13-year-olds.Another ""crime"" on CNN's list comes from a university where ""somebody chalked the words 'Trump,' 'Build wall' and '[Expletive deleted] your safe space' in front of the library.That's right: they used actual chalk.Other than that, there's not much. Elizabeth Nolan Brown of Reason.com has posted a more extensive list of cases where police were unable to verify the allegations being made, including an alleged attack on a gay man in Santa Monica, California.Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA) documented three men showing up at a Veterans Day parade with Confederate flags. Provocative? Deliberately. Offensive? Yes, to most. Hate crime? No.And yet Huffman blamed Donald Trump: ""We need to prepare for more of this because the Trump campaign has legitimized and given public space to some shadowy groups that used to hide from public view.""(For the record, Trump supported efforts to remove the Confederate flag from the South Carolina state capitol.)Meanwhile, thousands of people flood city centers in Los Angeles, Portland, New York and elsewhere, in some cases setting fires, smashing windows and vandalizing anything they can.Night after night, the protests have continued, organized by radical left-wing organizations such as MoveOn.org and ANSWER, in rejection of the results of a democratic election.And some of the rhetoric of the protests has been bigoted, and violent. One sign at a Los Angeles protest Saturday read: ""This Machine Kills Fascists.""Some of the protests have resulted in violent attacks on police, and dozens of arrests.And there have been real hate crimes against Trump supporters, including a videotaped beating of a white man who was targeted because he was accused of voting for Trump.The wave of anti-Trump crimes -- ""hate crimes"" and otherwise -- committed by anti-Trump thugs overwhelms, by several orders of magnitude, whatever crimes are being attributed to Trump supporters.The narrative about a wave of ""hate crimes"" inspired by Trump is a deliberate fabrication, meant to tarnish the President-elect. It is a continuation of false accusations, during the campaign, that Trump represented the second coming of Hitler.It is an attempt to organize a new opposition, based on lies, and the deliberate sowing of mistrust at a time when Americans have been called -- by both presidential candidates -- to come together.Joel B.

Although he stopped short of naming suspects, Abbas's comments were widely seen as referring to his main political rival - Mohammad Dahlan, a former Fatah security chief.Dahlan, a fierce Abbas critic who lives in self-imposed exile in the United Arab Emirates, took to Facebook on Saturday to point the finger at Abbas.""He (Abbas) is not qualified to make accusations and he personally is in the circle of accusation and the sole beneficiary of Abu Ammar disappearance,"" Dahlan wrote, referring to Arafat by his nickname.Abbas's office could not be reached for comment.Officials within Fatah are growing increasingly impatient with Abbas's leadership and rival groups have been emerging ahead of a party congress, the first since 2009, set to take place this month.Dahlan, 55, retains influence within Fatah's revolutionary council and central committee - the equivalent of Fatah's parliament.Abbas, 81, is expected at the party congress to push for the election of a new central committee and revolutionary council that would be free of Dahlan loyalists.Saudi Arabia, Egypt and other Arab states have been pressuring Abbas to resolve divisions in Fatah and with the rival Hamas movement. Neighboring states and diplomats fear the festering divisions could lead to conflict.Arafat, who signed the 1993 Oslo interim peace accord with Israel but led a deadly uprising after subsequent talks broke down in 2000, died in 2004 aged 75 in a French hospital four weeks after falling ill.The official cause of death was a massive stroke, but French doctors were unable at the time to determine the origin of the illness and no autopsy was carried out. Palestinian leaders have blamed Israel. Israel denies involvement.A French investigation was opened in 2012 at the request of Arafat's widow, and his remains were exhumed for tests that were examined separately by French, Russian and Swiss experts.The Swiss reported their results were consistent with but not proof of poisoning by reactive polonium. The French concluded he did not die of poisoning and Russian experts were reported to have found no traces of polonium in his body.The investigation was closed in 2015.SIGN UP"

The suspects were accused of an attempted coup d'etat and planning the assassination of Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic.The investigation is still under way, but leaks to the local media suggest that Russia was behind the plot, designed to sabotage the election and stop the Djukanovic government from, in 2017, bringing Montenegro into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as its 29th member state.This week's exercises were part of its accession preparation, and Montenegro was selected for the exercise because of a series of floods the country has suffered from in the past.Read more here.SIGN UP

Trump Kellyanne Conway emphasized on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM Patriot Radio Channel 125 that not only did Trump hire her based on her merits, not her gender, but that he was the one who elevated her to the high position in his campaign.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBreitbart News Saturday radio co-host Sonnie Johnson asked Conway: In Conway's capacity as the first woman to run a successful presidential campaign, ""Did you steal Hillary Clinton's hammer?"" Democratic Party presidential nominee Clinton was the first female nominee of a major party and would have been the first female president of the United States had she not lost the election.Johnson thanked Conway for allowing her to tell her daughter the morning after the election that Clinton would never be her president. She then told Conway that her daughter then asked if could she meet Kellyanne Conway now.Conway responded graciously, saying that she thinks about people like Johnson's daughter and her own daughters and her son when she thinks about what this election means. ""It honestly means this is an election of the people, for the people, and by the people and I feel, ya know, people will stop me in the street and they'll say: You all, meaning Mr. Trump and the campaign, but Mr. Trump of course, saved the Supreme Court, saved America, gave us a nice restart button, and that's for the people. For me it's especially for future generations.""Conway continued:So I am told that, I know Hillary Clinton failed to break the glass ceiling, but that I did in being the first female presidential campaign manager that was successful. There were three democratic campaign managers who were female before me, but their candidates lost. So I do, I'm not a big gender person. I know Mr. Trump hired me because of my talents and my skills and not because -- he put a team together that was amazing -- and not because of my gender, but at the same time I do feel a special responsibility. And you know what, I do feel like kickin' up my heels a little because I worked in a Republican Party infrastructure that doesn't always elevate female consultants to the top and that there's not always an opportunity.But I want everybody to remember, Sonnie, that it was Donald J. Trump who elevated a woman to the highest position in his campaign, much like he has done in the Trump Corporation for a number of decades, and it is he who gave women responsibilities and it is he, by the way, who did the same among female voters as did Mitt Romney and John McCain for all this talk. I mean the first female President, it did not attract a critical mass of women. I always said, knew and said publicly, probably on Breitbart radio, that she would need about 60 percent of the female vote to win, and she got nowhere near there because she had this reverse gender gap with men.But I'm excited, I want all the little girls out there to know that the lessons are very simple. Be kind your entire life because all the kindness I showed to other people came back to me manifold in this campaign. And secondly and most importantly, if you work hard and you get your shot one day, you too will shine. You have to believe in yourself, don't listen to the critics, don't listen to the naysayers. You know who you are. You're beautiful, you're smart, you can do it, and that's my message to all those little girls out there.In August Trump elevated Conway from senior adviser to campaign manager after just a few weeks with the campaign.

I always said, knew and said publicly, probably on Breitbart radio, that she would need about 60 percent of the female vote to win, and she got nowhere near there because she had this reverse gender gap with men.

It can continue down the 'beltway bubble' path of a too-cosy relationship with respective media sponsors, too often unable to see the electoral forest for the data-driven trees. Or, it can venture along the 'painful truth' path, admitting that any good poll is a blend of science and art,"" Basham explained during an exclusive interview with Breitbart News.He continued:The former is necessary, but insufficient, in today's world of anti-polling cynicism, privacy concerns, very low response rates, and 'shy' conservative respondents. Polling artists are necessary, for they inject some realism, some balance, into the raw number-crunching. If pollsters candidly revealed more about the inherent limitations of their craft, it would restore some of the public's faith in the inherent utility of their profession.Basham, who referred to himself as a free market guy and who previously worked at the Cato Institute, credited voter turnout as to why he was able to predict both the Brexit and Trump victories accurately through his polling.""Both Brexit and the American election were always going to be about turnout. It was as important -- if not more important -- to know who was going to show up, than to know exactly how they were going to vote,"" he stated.He went on to explain that voters who supported leaving the European Union (E.U.) and Trump voters were both more enthusiastic and determined to show up and vote than the opposition.""We knew that the turnout model that many of the media pollsters were using was going to overestimate the vote to remain,"" he added, noting the enthusiasm from voters wanting to leave the E.U.""There was a shy Brexit voter just like there was a shy Trump voter,"" Basham also explained, noting that both people who supported leaving the E.U. and people that supported Trump would identify as undecided instead of disclosing their preference to a pollster.Basham explained about Brexit, noting it was similar to how people didn't want to identify as a Trump voter during the U.S. presidential election:What we tried really hard to do, and I think we were successful, was to ask people a lot of questions about their attitudes to all kinds of things in order to figure out how likely they were if they were telling us they were undecided, were they really undecided, or were they reluctant to tell us they wanted to vote to leave. We used the same methodology in terms of the way that we asked all these other questions, what we were looking at the U.S. election, and we reached the same conclusion that there were a lot of shy reluctant Trump voters. They were telling pollsters that they were undecided.He said the ""shy"" Trump voter, who would identify as undecided to pollsters, accounted for anywhere from two to four percent nationally.Basham's analysis is exactly how Trump campaign pollster Adam Geller explained the campaign's success to Fox News's Fox & Friends on Saturday morning.""We had a smart team of people who are really diving into the data. You can't just look at the top lines,"" Geller explained about how the Trump campaign analyzed the polls, adding that it is important to figure out ""who is most likely to show up.""""What the top lines don't tell you is how are undecideds going to break. One of the most important lessons we can all learn from this is we have to go beyond the top line numbers,"" Geller declared, adding that with polling, there will always be undecided voters, but figuring out exactly how the undecided voters will break can provide a more accurate prediction of the election outcome.Basham said that with both Brexit voters and Trump voters, there was a general frustration with politics as normal and that is what drove those voters to the polls. He also applauded the International Business Daily (IBD/TIPP) tracking poll and the USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times ""Daybreak"" poll, which both consistently showed Trump with a lead over Clinton.""The IBD/TIPP poll -- [with] who the media sponsor is -- that poll was never designed to lead or create a narrative,"" Basham explained, alleging that other media polls may have been ""designed to lead the coverage.""""The LA Times ... that poll is an academic poll. It's the USC people who do it,"" he noted, referring to it as an experiment and pointing out that it also factored in enthusiasm and intensity of voters.Basham said that other polls got it wrong for one of two reasons: either they never adjusted the expected Democratic turnout to be lower than President Obama's numbers, or the media sponsors may have influenced the pollsters.Most pollsters, according to Basham, ""began their polling overestimating what the Democratic turnout would be, assuming that Hillary could replicate the Obama coalition...but they never learned from what was going on,"" with the enthusiasm from Trump supporters.Basham added that although most pollsters are smart, ""Anyone with any sense and exposure to just an average voter would know that this year was going to be different.""The former is necessary, but insufficient, in today's world of anti-polling cynicism, privacy concerns, very low response rates, and 'shy' conservative respondents. Polling artists are necessary, for they inject some realism, some balance, into the raw number-crunching. If pollsters candidly revealed more about the inherent limitations of their craft, it would restore some of the public's faith in the inherent utility of their profession.What we tried really hard to do, and I think we were successful, was to ask people a lot of questions about their attitudes to all kinds of things in order to figure out how likely they were if they were telling us they were undecided, were they really undecided, or were they reluctant to tell us they wanted to vote to leave.

I simply want to understand the suffering that their approach causes the poor and excluded,"" he said when asked point blank for his opinion on the new President-elect.Pushed further regarding his specific worries, the Pope replied, ""The question of refugees and immigrants. Only a small proportion of them are Christians, but this does not change the situation as far as we are concerned, or their suffering and distress.""The Pope recognized that much of the pushback against massive immigration comes from the lower and middle classes, who are afraid of too many jobs going to immigrants and the effects on the national economy.""Unfortunately,"" he said, often, welcoming immigration policies ""are opposed by populations that are afraid of losing jobs and of lower wages. Money is against the poor as well as against immigrants and refugees, but there are also poor people in rich countries who fear the arrival of their fellows from poor countries.""""It is a vicious circle and it must be broken,"" Francis continued. ""We must break down the walls that divide us: we must try to increase prosperity and make it more widespread, but to achieve this we need to break down walls and build bridges that allow us to reduce inequality and increase freedom and rights.""""More rights and greater freedom,"" he said.Writing in the Italian daily La Repubblica, Scalfari took advantage of his interview with the Pope to launch his own diatribe against Donald Trump, calling his election a ""disaster"" for Europe.""Trump's victory is catastrophic for us Europeans and Italians,"" he wrote. ""Trump is the white angel, fighting the establishment of the United States, against all the immigrants and their families.""Scalfari said that Trump's triumph ""reinforces all the movements in Europe that are opposed to the elites and governing classes in their countries,"" naming the Five Star Movement, Le Pen in France, Italy's Northern League and the ""parties behind Brexit.""""Trump has no charisma and no political competence,"" Scalfari said.

Trump and the ""mandate"" given to him by the American people who propelled him to victory.""Now is the time to move forward on the Trump agenda, not back to the failed Ryan policies,"" Martin told Breitbart News. ""On Tuesday, November 8, the American voters showed conclusively that Paul Ryan is not the leader for this moment in our history.  The message is clear: Ryan's judgment was rejected!""Martin explained that ""the voters' clear message is that Ryan is wrong for the American people and the Republican Party in at least two ways: First, his policy agenda, which included amnesty for illegals, as well as open borders, free trade deals, and a plan to cut Americans' hard-earned benefits, was soundly rejected. Second, his political judgment in failing to support Donald Trump was ill-advised.""""Paul Ryan should yield to a new Republican leader whose policy positions and political judgment are in line with the Trump Republican Party,"" Martin added. ""There are plenty of Republican members ready to lead, including stalwarts, especially in the Freedom Caucus.Trump's win on election night represented Phyllis Schlafly's final victory. The late conservative icon and grassroots warrior led the conservative grassroots into battle for more than half a century.Schlafly was one of Trump's earliest and most influential backers in the conservative movement. In August, Schlafly called for the American people to ""get rid"" of Ryan.""Get rid of him! We don't want anybody who believes in open borders,"" Schlafly told Breitbart.Schlafly said that Ryan repeatedly demonstrated that he is ""not really for America"" and is ""not for American citizens."" She further explained that if Speaker Ryan could not get in line with the majority of the American electorate on immigration, he ""should resign.""""I don't think we should accept him as Speaker,"" Schlafly said. ""We need a new leader in Congress who will represent the issues that Donald Trump ran on because they were the winning issues.""""I think one of the reasons Trump was nominated was because he wants to put America first and defend the interests of the United States,"" Schlafly said. ""Obviously, Paul Ryan is not an 'America first' guy.""Schlafly also indicated at the time that if the GOP were to follow Ryan down the path of supporting the donor class's corporate agenda, it would have meant the death of the Republican Party.Indeed, it was Ryan's failed 2012 campaign with Mitt Romney that led Republican leaders and consultants to issue the GOP ""autopsy report.""The ""autopsy,"" commissioned and championed by Reince Priebus, took as one of its conclusions that to win elections, Republicans must embrace an immigration agenda that would import future voters who tend to overwhelmingly support Democrat policies. ""The Priebus manifesto,"" as Schlafly called it, argued against opposing amnesty efforts and appealing to the Republican electorate's ""core constituency.""""We must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform. If we do not, our Party's appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only,"" Priebus' commissioned report stated.Schlafly told Breitbart News in August that she was hopeful about the future of the GOP because Trump will lead the Republican Party in a different direction than Ryan-one that is in line with the wishes of ""real Republicans,"" rather than the desires of Republican donors.""He's got the traditional values of real Republicans,"" Schlafly said. ""I don't think the GOP is going to die. I think Trump is going to revive it.""""If [Paul Ryan] can't get in line with majority of the electorate on the biggest issue [immigration], he should resign, and we should get someone who fulfills the wishes and the hopes of the majority who just nominated Trump,"" Schlafly said. ""It doesn't sound like he [Ryan] is loyal to the Republican Party. We need someone who is going to be a spokesman for the Republican Party and its nominee. And if Ryan doesn't fill that bill, we should get another one.""It is unclear whether conservative lawmakers in the House Freedom Caucus, led by Congressman Jim Jordan, will elect Paul Ryan as House Speaker, given that Ryan stands opposed to nine of ten GOP voters on the critical issues of trade and immigration.SIGN UP"

Rejected at the polls, progressives took to the streets with new slogans and a new mythology to undermine not only Donald Trump's agenda but his legitimacy as well.""Majority of Voters chose Clinton!"" screamed a Planned Parenthood banner headline two days after the election.That theme has been used by many Trump opponents to challenge the legitimacy of his election. It's like a Cleveland Indians baseball fan yelling that his team won a majority of the runs scored in all seven games. Well, sorry, but the Cubs won four of the seven games, and that's how the World Series is decided. Trump won the Electoral College vote and that's how the Presidency is decided under the Constitution.However, as a matter of fact, Hillary Clinton did NOT win a majority of the popular vote, her opponents did. Clinton won 47.7 percent of the popular vote, not 50 percent plus one. That means that 52.3 percent of the voters supported someone else as President. If you add McMullin's anti-Trump .3 percent to Hillary's 47.7 percent, that is still only 48 percent and short of the 52 percent anti-Hillary vote when you add Gary Johnson's 3.3 percent and Jill Stein's 1.0 percent.Sorry, Juan Williams, but Hillary lost the popular vote. Get over it.If you need more evidence of voter support of Trump's mandate, consider the OTHER national election held on November 8 -- the election of 438 members of United States House of Representatives: Republican candidates won some 3,000,000 more votes that Democratic candidates and retained majority control of that body.The street demonstrations against President-elect Trump are not merely a temper tantrum by ""sore losers"" who were expecting a different outcome. Those street protests are a foretaste of what is in store for the country as we slide toward Third World politics.The left does not accept the moral legitimacy of the US Constitution, so why should we expect the left to respect Trump's 306 -232 victory in the Electoral College?In fact, the progressives are busy plotting to persuade enough of the Electoral College electors who will meet in December to cast a majority of their votes for Hillary Clinton -- ignoring the wishes of the voters who elected them on November 8. Hypocrisy knows no bounds when it comes to ""progressive politics.""These street protests against Trump's victory are not simply emotional outbursts by spoiled children. They are the first stage of an organized progressive campaign to first delegitimize Trump's mandate and then derail his policy agenda. The left hopes to transform the ""Heckler's veto"" of free speech into the anarchists' veto of constitutional government. And huge segments of the mainstream media will be a business partner in that enterprise.If you need evidence that the current street protests are not simply spontaneous combustion among disappointed partisans, look at the funding behind the groups supporting the demonstrations.MoveOn.Org is in the forefront, as are other groups funded by Hillary's deep pockets friend, George Soros. Are local Democrat mayors in Portland, Oakland, Los Angeles, and Denver loudly condemning the protests and asking their police departments to arrest the lawbreakers? Or do they offer sympathy and encourage the protests with all-purpose slogans like, ""We feel your pain?""Donald Trump has been elected President of the United States by a resounding vote more representative of the nation than Bill Clinton's 43 percent victory in 1992.Republicans did not take to the streets protesting Bill Clinton's poor showing of only 43 percent of the popular vote.But this is 2016, and progressives are suddenly angry and confused, finding themselves on the wrong side of history.
