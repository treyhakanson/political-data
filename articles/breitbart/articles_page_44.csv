On Thursday, Steven Crowder came on the show, ""Whatever It Takes,"" to talk about talk politics, humor, Uber and magnetic resonance imaging devices.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER
Call into the show: (877) 240-1776Crowder is the host of the ""Louder with Crowder"" podcast and news site, as well as a conservative activist.For many years, Crowder toured college campuses, but he said the threats of physical violence because too real and too dangerous for him to continue. ""I don't show up unless the FBI is there,"" he said.Threats against him and other conservatives are just part of the intellectual suppression taking place on American campuses, he said.Colleges are producing completely uninformed citizens, Crowder said. ""They really are indoctrination factories.""Still, there are some students willing to stand up for conservatism or even the rights of conservatives, he said. Some of them are thinking: ""You know what? I am not a sexist because I open a door for a woman,"" he said.If he was a political consultant for the Republican Party, Crowder said he would focus on four issues: for gun rights, for free speech, against feminism and its disruption of gender roles and against Islamic terrorism.The former child actor told Schilling because he was raised in Canada, he comes to America and American politics with appreciation and insights her own citizens seem to miss.Freedom is used in the United States to mean different things for different people. ""Liberals don't care about Freedom regarding what you eat, the Big Gulps you can drink, what car you can drive do to emissions. They don't even want you to the right to Uber,"" he said.""When it comes to forcing you and me to pay for somebody else's abortion, the Freedom card gets slapped down on the table,"" Crowder said.But, conservatives should not give up hope that things can turn around, he said.In Canada, the people were stuck with a government-run health care monopoly that was unresponsive to the needs of the people, he said. ""There were two MRI's in the country when my mother ruptured her disc-she had to wait nine months."" Then, the country's high court overturned the ban on private medicine and things have started to improve, he said.There is a chance that Hillary R. Clinton may win the election, yet, conservatives must continue to fight on, he said.You can hear Whatever It Takes weekdays from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m., online at Breitbart.com.Join the show as a caller: (877) 240-1776SIGN UP"

And, as Schweizer has written at Breitbart News, key questions about the uranium deal remain unanswered, several months later.The remarks about the uranium deal did not appear to be in Trump's prepared text, but when a supporter from the audience shouted ""Uranium!"" during one of Trump's monologues about Hillary Clinton's alleged corruption, Trump picked up the hint: ""Uranium is right ... uranium to Russia.""The rest of Trump's speech hit the main points he had addressed throughout the day at stops elsewhere in Ohio, including Springfield and Toledo. Trump spoke about repealing Obamacare and its premium hikes; re-negotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA); ending the flow of Syrian refugees; stopping illegal immigration. bringing jobs back to the U.S.; and ridding Washington, D.C. of endemic corruption.Chants of ""Drain the swamp!"" alternated with ""Lock her up!"" as crowd favorites in response to Trump's attacks on corruption, and on Hillary Clinton's various scandals.The audience, many of whom had waited for four hours to see Trump, was boisterous throughout the speech, and included people of all ages.Mordechai Giffin, 32, an Orthodox Jew from the Cleveland suburb of University Heights, spoke to Breitbart News about the accusation that Trump, and his campaign, were antisemitic.""It's just a stereotype,"" Giffin said. ""There's no evidence of it. His daughter's an Orthodox Jew and his son-in-law is Jewish."" Giffin, who owns a business in the area of the rally, told Breitbart News his main motivation for supporting Trump was his preference for ""conservative government.""Toward the end of the speech, Trump also informed the audience that his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, was unharmed after his campaign plane slid off the runway at La Guardia airport in New York earlier in the evening. No one else on the flight was injured, either.Joel B.

Heritage wanted to honor the conservative lion by asking him to give the Joseph Story Distinguished Lecture at one of the nation's foremost think tanks.This lecture is ""one of Heritage's most prestigious events"" and part of its ""Protect the Constitution Series,"" explained Attorney General Ed Meese as he introduced Thomas to a packed room of scholars, lawyers, journalists, and guests.Praising Thomas as ""one of the clearest writers"" on the Supreme Court, Meese lauded him as one of the finest public servants of his time, beginning with his service in the Reagan administration as assistant secretary of education for civil rights and later the chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), before being appointed to the federal appeals court by the first President Bush.In a sit-down interview exchange with John Malcolm, director of the Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at the Heritage Foundation, Thomas said one of the most important aspects of his work is to put forth ""the effort to have a consistent judicial philosophy"" -- that how a justice decides any issue of law should reflect the same approach he takes to the law in any other case during his years of service.This can be a personal challenge when ""your heart goes one way"" in a difficult case but the law requires a different result, Thomas told the audience. The law should rest on neutral principles that generate predictable outcomes, creating a stable legal environment.The 68-year old jurist criticized constitutional doctrines invented by the Supreme Court that are not found in the text, structure, or history of the Supreme Law of the Land, such as the ""dormant Commerce Clause.""While the Constitution gives Congress the authority to regulate interstate commerce, the Supreme Court long ago invented the idea that even when Congress does not pass a law, this constitutional provision somehow forbids states from adopting laws that the justices believe unduly burden interstate commerce, a concept that Thomas laughed off as a ""hibernating bear.""Thomas also reminisced about his good friend, the late Justice Antonin Scalia.He recalled one day during oral argument at the Supreme Court, Scalia leaned over to comment that Auer v. Robbins -- a case often criticized by conservatives, in which the Court held that when a government agency interprets ambiguous terms in its own regulations, courts should defer to such interpretations so long as they are reasonable -- is one of the worst precedents in Supreme Court history""But Nino,"" Thomas responded, ""You wrote it!""Asked what part of his job he likes most, Thomas answered, ""The thing that I enjoy the most are my law clerks,"" calling them ""fun"" and praising the ""energy"" that they bring to his work.Every year, each justice selects as law clerks for one year four lawyers who previously served as clerks for judges on federal appeals courts. Only the most brilliant lawyers are considered for these coveted positions.Born in the Deep South, this native of Pin Point, Georgia, cited as a highlight of his tenure the day that a man came running up to him at Gettysburg asking Thomas to sign a copy of a Court opinion he had written. (The case was Federal Maritime Commission v. South Carolina State Ports Authority, concerning a state's sovereign immunity from suit.) The breathless man told the justice, ""I read all your opinions because I can understand them.""That, Thomas said, is what he thinks the law should be all about, explaining that a judge should take the Constitution -- or any law -- and ""make it accessible"" to everyday Americans who must live under its authority.""Genius is not putting a $2 idea in a $20 sentence,"" he added. Instead, it's ""putting a $20 idea in a $2 sentence without losing its meaning.""Thomas frequently visits Gettysburg, taking his law clerks there each year at the end of the Court's term (which goes from October through June), to show them the incredible sacrifices that others made before them to give us the marvelous freedoms we enjoy today. He hopes to inspire them to ""remain hopeful and idealist,"" and to have faith ""in the perfectability of this great Republic.""The justice explained that properly interpreting one of the most consequential provisions in the Constitution -- the Fourteenth Amendment -- is impossible without understanding the Civil War.But he takes his clerks to Gettysburg to evoke much broader questions in his clerks as they go forward with their lives and careers. ""Why this government? Why this Republic?""Thomas posits that the Constitution is best understood in the context of the Declaration of Independence, as a charter for a form of government the Framers designed to fulfill the purposes and role of government set forth in the Declaration. He hopes that beholding the place where tens of thousands of Americans gave their ""last full measure"" is a poignant lesson those clerks will never forget.Thomas embraces originalism: that every written law -- including the Constitution -- must only be interpreted according to the meaning that regular people would assign to those words. It is the only way for unelected judges to interpret the law in a democratic republic.""It's a guy camping out of the back of his motorcycle who just wants to be left alone,"" Thomas concluded with a broad smile on his face, referencing a sight he commonly sees when he and his wife Ginni drive their RV around the country during the Court's summer break. ""He wants to enjoy his country. He wants to raise his family.""Justice Clarence Thomas clearly relishes playing a role in a constitutional system that promises the guy camping out the back of his motorcycle can do just that.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

Dwight Hammond, 73, and Steven Hammond, 46, said they lit fires on federal land in 2001 and 2006 to reduce the growth of invasive plants and protect their property from wildfires. The two were convicted three years ago and served time -- the father three months, the son one year. But in October, a federal judge in Oregon ruled their terms were too short under U.S. law and ordered them back to prison for about four years each. A group of armed protesters broke away from the event in Burns and traveled 30 miles south to occupy the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. Their demands included the freeing of the jailed ranchers and that the wildlife refuge be turned over to local control.The trial lasted for five weeks.

Trump, the Republican nominee for president, has closed the gap with his Democratic opponent Hillary Rodham Clinton with just a couple weeks left in the election, the latest national Breitbart News Network/Gravis Marketing poll shows.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERClinton, at 46 percent, leads Trump at 45 percent by just one point--inside the survey's 2.3 percent margin of error. Libertarian Gary Johnson gets just 3 percent and the Green Party's Dr. Jill Stein just 1 percent, while 4 percent are unsure. The survey was conducted from Oct. 25 to Oct. 26, sampling 1,824 registered voters across the United States. The poll was conducted using a combination of interactive voice response polling and an internet panel of cell phone users.""Something has happened since the third debate,"" Doug Kaplan, the managing partner of Gravis Marketing, said of the poll. ""Conventional wisdom was after Trump said he wouldn't promise to accept the results of the election and made the 'nasty woman' comment, many thought Hillary would gain--but Trump seems to be closing the gap. In every election in the last 30 years, this happens where the person behind closes the gap. Hillary still has a clear electoral advantage and many paths to victory. However, Trump is not out of it but Hillary is still the favorite.""""This is a big story because it shows Trump really closing, importantly, as the other close polls are showing,"" Democratic pollster Pat Caddell, who worked for President Jimmy Carter and is working with Breitbart News and Gravis Marketing on these polls, added. ""He is closing with his favorability and unfavorability as well.Caddell said he thinks Obamacare's failures, where premiums are skyrocketing, is one of many reasons why Trump is surging. ""Among other things, that is contributing [to Trump's rise in the polls],"" Caddell said. ""When we are looking down the road at other things that may be influential, we are seeing the possibility of again on the immigration issue--that thing about concern on the border seems to be increasing as is opposition to Hillary and their plans to expand immigration and refugees, which is another big issue. But more importantly, at the end of the survey, we see both candidates have problems on their ability to unite the country and on whether or not they can have the moral leadership to lead. They're basically about the same, which I consider a real improvement for Trump now that he's that close.""In issue-based questions, a plurality--46 percent total--said they thought it was either ""very likely"" or ""somewhat likely"" that the election would be ""rigged,"" one of Trump's major talking points in the final days. Twenty-five percent thought it is ""very likely"" the election is ""rigged,"" while 21 percent thought it was ""somewhat likely."" Thirty-nine percent thought it was ""not likely at all"" that the election would be ""rigged,"" while 11 percent said it was ""not very likely"" and 4 percent were unsure.A majority surveyed also said they believe Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted for her illicit home brew email server. Fifty-one percent said they believe ""the FBI made the wrong decision and she should have been prosecuted"" versus only 42 percent saying ""the FBI made the correct decision and she should not have been prosecuted,"" when asked which is closer to their view among those statements after read this background: ""The FBI has concluded that Hillary Clinton potentially exposed top secret information to hostile countries when she used a private email server when she was Secretary of State but the agency has decided not to seek a criminal indictment of her."" Eight percent were unsure.A vast majority of Americans surveyed also said they were either very or somewhat concerned with controlling immigration and securing the southern border. Forty-nine percent, a near majority, said they were ""very concerned"" about that while 27 percent said they were ""somewhat concerned"" and only 17 percent were not concerned while 6 percent were uncertain.A whopping 54 percent of those surveyed answered ""no"" when asked: ""Has Obamacare been a success?"" Only 34 percent said ""yes"" and 12 percent said they were unsure.""We see an increase in negative reactions to Obamacare,"" Caddell said. ""That seems to be rising, which is reflective of the recent news--that's a 20-point margin now, by the way.""On refugees, 34 percent said they wanted to stop taking refugees altogether while 23 percent said they wanted a reduction when asked this question: ""Do you support President Obama's plan to increase the number of refugees coming to the United States from the Middle East, Africa, and other parts of the world to 110,000 next year, up from the current level of 85,000, or do you think we should allow no refugees, fewer refugees, or the same as the current level?"" Only 18 percent said they wanted the same amount and 26 percent said they wanted an increase.Similarly, when asked about Hillary Clinton's plans to increase refugees, 63 percent said they disapproved of what she's planning to do when asked this question: ""Hillary Clinton's supporters at the Refugee Council want to increase the number of refugees coming into the United States in 2017 even more, to 200,000, and Hillary wants to increase the number of Syrian refugees in that total from 10,000 in 2016 to 65,000 in 2017. Do you approve or disapprove of this increase?"" Only 26 percent approved of Hillary Clinton's refugee plans, while 11 percent were unsure.A majority, 51 percent, also said they do not believe that the refugees already here have been subjected to the ""most rigorous security vetting, as the Obama Administration claims."" Only 32 percent said they did think so, and 17 percent were unsure.On trade policy, a plurality agreed with Donald Trump on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP). Respondents were asked: ""Do you agree or disagree with Donald Trump, who said that NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, is the worst trade deal in modern American history, and that TPP, the Trans Pacific Partnership, is almost as bad?"" In response, 47 percent said they agreed with Trump and 28 percent disagreed--while 25 percent didn't know.A majority, 53 percent, said the revelations contained in the WikiLeaks publishing of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's emails were damaging to Clinton's credibility, while 36 percent said the revelations in WIkiLeaks were not and 11 percent didn't know. Similarly, a majority of 62 percent said the accusations by women of lewd conduct against Donald Trump were damaging to his credibility while 31 percent said they weren't and 7 percent didn't know.Respondents were split when asked if they agreed with Donald Trump's position that he has the right to challenge the election if the results are questionable, with 47 percent saying they disapproved of Trump's stance and 46 percent saying they approved while 7 percent were unsure.Both candidates received generally split answers as well when respondents were asked if Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump would have the moral authority to lead America if elected. Forty-seven percent said Hillary Clinton would not have the moral authority to lead while 45 percent said she would and 8 percent didn't know. Forty-nine percent said Donald Trump wouldn't have the moral authority to lead, while 40 percent said he would and 11 percent didn't know.Similarly, majorities of voters don't believe either candidate will be able to unite the country if they win. Fifty-six percent said they either strongly or somewhat disagreed that Donald Trump would be able to unite the country if he wins, with 42 percent saying they either strongly or somewhat think he will be able to unite the country and 3 percent unsure. Fifty-three percent either strongly or somewhat don't believe Hillary Clinton can unite the country if she wins, while 42 percent either strongly or somewhat do not believe she can and 5 percent don't know.A majority--52 percent--believe that the Clintons were selling influence to foreign governments through the Clinton Foundation. Respondents were asked this question: ""There are reports that the Clinton Foundation started by Bill and Hillary Clinton accepted substantial donations from foreign governments and other individual donors while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. How likely do you think it is that Bill and Hillary Clinton were selling influence to foreign governments and other individual donors?"" In response, 52 percent either strongly or somewhat agreed they were selling influence while only 35 percent somewhat or strongly disagreed and 12 percent didn't know.Majorities also believe that if Donald Trump wins the election, the elites lose--and that if Hillary Clinton wins the election, the elites win.Respondents were asked whether they agree, somewhat or strongly, or disagree, somewhat or strongly, with this statement: ""If Hillary Clinton wins, the political elite and special interests win."" In response, 46 percent said they strongly agreed and 11 percent somewhat agreed for a solid majority of 58 percent in total agreeing that if Hillary Clinton wins the election the special interests and political elites win the election. Only 23 percent strongly disagreed and 13 percent somewhat disagreed--for a total of 35 percent in disagreement--while 7 percent didn't know.Respondents were also asked whether they agree, somewhat or strongly, or disagree, somewhat or strongly, with this statement: ""If Donald Trump wins, the political elite and special interests lose."" In response, 36 percent said they strongly agreed and 15 percent said they somewhat agreed for a total of 51 percent in agreement. Only 25 percent strongly disagreed and 13 percent somewhat disagreed for a total of 39 percent of disagreement, while 10 percent didn't know.A vast majority--61 percent--also said they believe this election is their last chance to change direction as a country. Respondents were asked if they agreed or disagreed with this statement: ""For years, the political elites have governed America for their own benefit-- and to the detriment of the American people. This election is the best chance in our lives to take back our government and change course."" In response, 43 percent said they strongly agreed, 17 percent somewhat agreed, 14 percent somewhat disagreed, 20 percent strongly disagreed and 6 percent didn't know. That means 61 percent in total agreed, while 33 percent in total disagreed.In addition, the poll asked about the new Project Veritas videos from James O'Keefe. Forty percent said they had seen the video, 17 percent said they read about it, 24 percent heard a little about it and 18 percent heard nothing about it.Those surveyed were then read this statement about the video and asked several questions about it: ""Several organizations that go back to the Democratic National Committee and even perhaps to the campaign of Hillary Clinton had operatives who, in an undercover investigative video expose, admitted that they had recruited people to disrupt Donald Trump events and even discussed how to rig votes in the general election. Those two operatives were both fired. The person they identify as their leader, and who appears in the video, turns out to have been to the Obama White House almost 350 times and had dozens of direct meetings with President Obama.""The first question they were asked was whether they think this is a major scandal or not. Given four options, an overwhelming plurality--48 percent--answered this way: ""It is a Major Scandal and needs to be considered in the election."" Only 17 percent said this, ""It is a Minor Scandal and might need to be considered in the election,"" while 19 percent said this ""It is Not much of a scandal and does not need much consideration in the election."" A paltry 15 percent completely brushed it off, saying this: ""It is No scandal at all and not important at all to this election.""Majorities also thought that the media was in the tank for Hillary Clinton against Donald Trump. When asked which statement more closely represented their views, 53 percent said: ""The behavior of the vast majority of the media in favor of Hillary Clinton and biased against Donald Trump, including not covering certain stories, is a threat to the people's right to know and to American democracy."" Only 30 percent said this statement more closely represents their views: ""Such conduct is normal and is not that important and not a threat to the people's right to know and to American democracy."" Seventeen percent didn't know.Similarly, respondents were asked this question: ""The non-partisan Center for Public Integrity reported this week that according to federal records, 430 people who work in journalism have made contributions to presidential campaigns. 96 percent of the money contributed, or $382,000, was donated to Hillary Clinton by about 380 of these journalists. 50 of these journalists have combined to give $14,000 to Donald Trump. Which of the following best represents your opinion?""Respondents were then asked to say which of two statements more fits their view. Forty-four percent said this statement fits their view: ""The behavior of the vast majority of the media in favor of Hillary Clinton and biased against Donald Trump, including not covering certain stories, is a threat to the people's right to know and to American democracy."" And 44 percent said this statement more reflects their views: ""Such conduct is normal and is not that important and not a threat to the people's right to know and to American democracy."" Eleven percent didn't know.The vast majority of those surveyed also said the media is favoring Clinton and opposing Trump. They were asked this question before being read four separate statements: ""Considering the coverage of the major television networks and a majority of the major newspapers which best describes how they are covering the election?"" Fifty-three percent, a solid majority, said they think this more fits their view: ""They are mostly favoring Hillary Clinton and are biased against Donald Trump."" A paltry 5 percent said the reverse, ""They are mostly favoring Donald Trump and are biased against Hillary Clinton,"" fits their view. Thirty-four percent said this, ""They are being equally fair to both candidates and are not biased against either candidate,"" fit their view better and 8 percent said this did: ""They are unfair to both candidates and biased against each.""October 27, 2016 Breitbart/Gravis Poll by Breitbart News on Scribd// <![CDATA[

In other words, the Republican presidential nominee, representing the supposed party of big business, is now on the ""anti-corporate"" side, while the Democratic presidential nominee, representing the supposed party of ordinary working people, is seemingly on the ""pro-corporate"" side. To help me wrestle with the implications of this improbable flip, I, ghost that I am, have turned to another ghost.  Namely, the shade of Theodore Roosevelt, America's 26th president, serving from 1901 to 1909.  In his day, Roosevelt--like Trump, a rich New York City-born Protestant--was also an improbable figure.  He was a war hero, a sub-cabinet appointee in two Republican administrations, and was also, in 1898, elected governor of New York State.  Yet even so, he was out of step with many, perhaps most, of his fellow Republicans on key issues--in particular, business regulation.  Notably, TR was a critic of the Republican stand-pat attitude toward business abuses.  And, not to put too fine a point on it, he viewed orthodox Republicanism as retrograde and reactionary, hopelessly outmoded in an era of rapidly swelling national needs.    Roosevelt was elected to the vice presidency in 1900, and while that was certainly an honor for him, it was also seen, by New York's Republican political bosses, as a clever way of getting him out of Albany--and out of their hair.  Nobody foresaw that President William McKinley would be assassinated in September 1901, thus elevating TR to the presidency. In office, one of President Roosevelt's trademarks was his association with ""trustbusting""--that is, antitrust enforcement, which was seen as a necessary response to the corporate behemoths that had grown to dominance in the mostly unregulated 19th century.  Indeed, it was common to see political cartoons of TR as a muscular trustbuster, personally battling piratical tycoons. And while Roosevelt passed from earth's mortal coil in 1919, happily for me, he still pays close attention to the news.   So amidst the rolling mists of Eternity, as Breitbart's most roving of roving correspondents, I was pleased to score an exclusive interview with The Colonel.  (Yes, he liked to be called that, because, of all the many things he did in his life, he was most proud of his service with the First US Volunteer Cavalry Regiment--a unit he had formed--in Cuba during the Spanish-American War.  His daring 1898 charge up San Juan Hill in broad daylight, against the entrenched Spanish infantry, ultimately earned him a Congressional Medal of Honor.) So what follows is a transcript of my interview with Roosevelt: Virgil: Mr. President, Colonel, thanks for taking time to speak with me.Theodore Roosevelt: Oh, enough with the formal folderol, Virgil!  Or else I'll start calling you ""Publius Vergilius Mero.""  So please, just call me ""Theodore."" V: Okay.  You prefer ""Theodore,"" not ""Teddy""?  TR: Yes . . . I haven't liked ""Teddy"" for a long time.  [Virgil has since learned that Roosevelt's first wife, Alice, had called him ""Teddy""; after she died in 1884, he didn't wish to hear that nickname any more.]V: Got it.  Well, uh, in any case, the subject at hand is big corporations and their combinations.  So I'll get right to it: What do you think of AT&T's pending purchase of Time Warner?  I mean, as a famous trustbuster, you always had an unorthodox view of antitrust for a Republican.  So now, do you agree with Donald Trump?TR: Actually, skepticism about big corporations and their doings is not quite so unorthodox for Republicans as you might think.  I was always, I would say, part of a strong tradition within the Party.  Since its inception in 1854, there has always been that tradition of skepticism about big business among many Republicans. V: Gee, I hadn't known that. TR: Yes. The Grand Old Party, when it was, in fact, the Grand New Party, got its start on Main Street, in Ripon, Wisconsin, to be precise, back in 1854.  To be sure, others claim that honor for another small town, Jackson, Michigan.  Yet either way, Ripon or Jackson, the Republican Party most definitely got its start among the farmers, free laborers, and merchants of the Midwest, not on Wall Street.  To put it another way, the GOP was the little-guy party, at a time when the Democratic Party--which had its own populist tradition, going back to Andrew Jackson--had been taken over by the Southern plantation slaveowners.V: Hmm.  I had always thought of the Republicans as the party of robber-baron railroad tycoons.TR: Yes. that's a common misconception.  Oh sure, the railroads were a big factor.  Particularly in the North, which had industrialized sooner than the South, the railroads were akin to what Silicon Valley is today--the vital infrastructure of the age, as well as an economic locomotive, if you'll pardon the wordplay.And yet precisely because the railroads were so huge, they had a massive influence on both parties.  When Commodore Vanderbilt, owner of a half-dozen big railroads, wanted to take control of the New York State legislature and use it for his personal gain, he just showed up in Albany with a trunk full of cash, doling it out to whomever would do his bidding, regardless of partisan label.  And that was true across the country.    Yet even so, as often as not, the early Republicans were true to their roots among the workingmen, even if that conflicted with the interests of the railroadmen.  For example, here are the words of the first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, in his message to Congress, December 3, 1861.  As you can see, Honest Abe was explicit about the greater importance of labor over capital:Labor is prior to and independent of capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed.  Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration. V: Interesting.TR:  Now it's worth pointing out that Lincoln actually had been a lawyer for the railroads back in Illinois in the 1850s.  Moreover, by his own bootstrapping nature, he was a strong believer in private property and free enterprise.  However, he saw something crucial: There had to be a balance between capital and labor, and the government--hopefully, a Republican government--had to calibrate that balance, always making sure that the interests of workers and small landholders were protected.Lincoln's idea of balance held true for labor relations, such as they were, and it held true, also, for the general management of the economy, including imports and foreign trade.  Interestingly, the most influential American economist of the 19th century was a man who was a believer in capitalism and property, but at the same time, a staunch opponent of unregulated laissez-faire.V: Who was that? TR: Henry C. Carey.  He's a man forgotten today, but his 1851 magnum opus, The Harmony of Interests: Agricultural, Manufacturing, and Commercial communicates its essence in its title: A happy country needs rules and guidelines that keep all sectors in harmony.  In other words, rules.  Carey was a conservative, ideologically, but at the same time, he could see the necessity of governmental action to preserve equilibrium.  You see, unlike today, when many Republicans regard the free market as the solution for everything, back then, Republicans thought more about social harmonies.  That is, they were conservatives.  After all, the hallmark of conservatism has been its reverence for such non-market-based concepts and institutions as culture, tradition, and church.  By contrast, those who bow down to the market, only, inevitably see everything as being for sale--the only issue is the price.  And that's a very different concept.   V: Interesting.  And yet today's ""conservatives"" mostly pride themselves on their devotion to the free market.TR: Those who are devoted to the free market--above God, country, and family--are really libertarians, not conservatives.  That is, they are the followers of a liberal tradition; they want to liberalize and liberate things--everything.  V: Really?  I hadn't thought of it that way.  TR: Yes, there's a recent phrase, coined by an avowed libertarian at the Cato Institute, seeking to instantiate this ultimate unity: He has called this synthesis ""liberaltarian."" V: Fascinating. TR: So back to Lincoln.  He was an emancipator, for sure, but was always mostly a conservative.  As an aside, I'll note that in his first inaugural address, Lincoln offered an extended hymn to our sacred union.  It was a strictly conservative peroration, a celebration of non-monetary values; it had nothing at all to do with market forces.  Have a listen: The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.V: I see, good point. TR: Okay, so now, more on Lincoln's conservative economics, which were, always, focused on balance and harmony.  Even as he praised labor and described it as ""prior"" to capital, he was also eager to make room for capital, too.  In that same 1861 speech to Congress, he said:Capital has its rights, which are as worthy of protection as any other rights.  Nor is it denied that there is, and probably always will be, a relation between labor and capital producing mutual benefits. Again, that's the point: mutual benefits--harmony.  His goal, and the goal of all conservatives, is actually to have no class warfare and no civil war. V: Although, of course, tragically, America got both.TR: Yes, those were tumultuous times.  But Lincoln and the Republicans, I am proud to say, managed to steer the ship of state through those stormy seas to safe harbor. V: Okay, that's an interesting history lesson.  So what about antitrust?  TR: My dear man, you asked me a question, and I am answering it.  Give me time! V: Yes, sir. TR: As the 19th century moved along, it became apparent that more had to be done to curb the power of what was becoming Big Business.  That is, not just the railroads, but all the corporate ""trusts,"" as we called them back then.And once again, in formulating the national response, it was Republicans who took the lead.  The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 was authored by Sen. John Sherman of Ohio, a Republican.V: The brother of William Tecumseh Sherman, the Union general in the Civil War? TR: Yes, quite so. They were both good men.  And the Sherman Act, I might add, was signed into law by a Republican president, Benjamin Harrison. V: So you're saying that antitrust is a Republican cause? TR: At times, it has been, and then, at times, not.  To borrow the phrase from the poet Walt Whitman, the Republican Party, like the Democratic Party, ""contains multitudes.""  And so now, in this historical quickmarch, let's now skip ahead a few years, to 1896.  In that year, we saw the election of a great man, William McKinley.V: Hmm.  If you say so.  Isn't McKinley, the 25th president, remembered as a tool of big business, a puppet in the hands of his puppet-master, the industrial magnate Mark Hanna? TR: Yes, unfortunately, that is the way President McKinley is remembered, and it's neither a fair nor accurate memory.  He was in reality a talented fellow, who, when young, was forced by financial exigency to drop out of college; he then worked as a postal clerk and schoolteacher before enlisting as a private in the Union Army in 1861.  And after four years of bloody combat, he had risen to the rank of major.Later he was elected to Congress from Ohio, and then, in '96, to the presidency.  And, once in the White House, President McKinley was then kind enough to select me as his running mate in 1900 when he sought re-election. V: And after the McKinley-Roosevelt ticket was victorious, he was assassinated. TR: Yes, he died on September 14, 1901; it was a terrible tragedy.  As I said to Congress after his death, ""He was the most widely loved man in all the United States""--except of course, by one evil anarchist, Leon Czolgosz, whom we nowadays would call a ""terrorist.""  Moreover, in paying tribute to my boss and my friend, I reminded my audience that he was no economic royalist but, rather, a true cloth-coat Republican: President McKinley was a man of moderate means, a man whose stock sprang from the sturdy tillers of the soil, who had himself belonged among the wage-workers. V: Okay, you've convinced me: There were plenty of lunchpail Republicans back then.  So how did this image of the Republicans as the party of plutocracy get started?  Has it all been media bias?  TR: As I said, Main Street Republicanism was one strand of the Party.  Another strand was Big Business and Wall Street Republicanism.  And within the GOP, the big shots, too, had their champions, such as the dreadful Sen. Nelson Aldrich of Rhode Island, whose daughter married John D. Rockefeller, Jr.  Aldrich was a reactionary, or, as I liked to call him and his ilk, a ""malefactor of great wealth."" V: So there were two Republican parties, or sub-parties, or factions.  TR: Yes. I was astride one, and Aldrich was astride the other.  And we fought like the dickens.  When I was a young man, back in the 1880s,  the reactionary faction was known as the ""Stalwarts,"" and as for the progressive faction, we were called ""Half-Breeds."" V: I guess ""Half-Breed"" is too politically incorrect for this era.TR: Yes, I suppose so.  But by any terminological dichotomy--Main Street vs. Wall Street, mossback vs. reformer, conservative vs. progressive--the split has been real and ongoing, stretching out as it has  a century-and-a-half.  Both sides have had their victories and their defeats. From my vantage point in the Oval Office--that was a structure, by the way, that I added to the White House, as part of the West Wing, in 1902--I could see that the rising tide of discontent had to be dealt with in a constructive manner.  You see, William Jennings Bryan, a fire-breathing populist whom I loathed, had taken over the Democratic Party in 1896.  Bryan had some good ideas, such as the advancement of workers' rights, but he was also irresponsible--I thought of him as a danger to the republic. Happily, McKinley beat Bryan in the '96 presidential election, and again in '00, and yet even so, it was obvious that Bryan had a substantial constituency; the populist upswell was going to continue, because economic conditions were harsh and times were indeed hard.  So something had to be done to improve the lot of workers and farmers, all the while maintaining the basic order of things.  And I felt that I was the man to do it.  I called my policy program the Square Deal.V: Sounds a bit like the New Deal of Franklin D. Roosevelt.TR: Well, Franklin was my cousin and, I daresay, a fan of mine. V: In any case, whatever the name, your goal was to stave off all that populist energy. TR: Yes, exactly.  But I knew that I couldn't stop domestic radicalism with reaction--that just feeds it.  Instead, I had to stop radicalism with prudent preemption.   As I think Edmund Burke said, the task of the statesman is to channel the tides of change through the canals of custom.V: Ooh, I like that.  TR: Yes, I love Burke.  V: So now to antitrust? TR: I'm getting there!In that same message to Congress in 1901, delivered just three months after I was sworn into office, I took the antitrust issue head on.  I began by reiterating the basic conservative Republican wisdom of the harmony of interests, because, ultimately, all Americans are in the same boat.  As I said:The fundamental rule in our national life-the rule which underlies all others-is that, on the whole, and in the long run, we shall go up or down together. I might note that that's the sort of ""One Nation"" rhetoric used a few decades before by the great British conservative leader and prime minister, Benjamin Disraeli.  That was his big idea: He could not let his country sunder, split apart, over class divisions and class warfare.  And that's exactly what I thought, too.And yet at the same time, in our search for solutions, we couldn't go blundering around, armed only by sentiments, as opposed to sapience.  V: I love latinate words!TR: As I also said:The mechanism of modern business is so delicate that extreme care must be taken not to interfere with it in a spirit of rashness or ignorance. V: Okay, got it.  But again, where does antitrust fit in?  TR: Virgil, you seem to be in rather a hurry. When, in fact, we both are in a place where the passage of time is measured in eons.V: Yes, Colonel--I mean, Theodore--but back on earth, there's still such a thing as time-scarcity.  They're called deadlines. ###Hi, this is Virgil: Speaking of deadlines, and other matters of time-scarcity and time-urgency, this is probably a good place to take a break. We will conclude my exclusive interview with Theodore Roosevelt in the next installment. Coming in Part Three: TR explains his theory of antitrust, and adds his explanation as to why size doesn't always matter.
Labor is prior to and independent of capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed.  Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration. 

The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.

Capital has its rights, which are as worthy of protection as any other rights.  Nor is it denied that there is, and probably always will be, a relation between labor and capital producing mutual benefits. 

President McKinley was a man of moderate means, a man whose stock sprang from the sturdy tillers of the soil, who had himself belonged among the wage-workers.

Mark HannaTR: Yes, unfortunately, that is the way President McKinley is remembered, and it's neither a fair nor accurate memory.  He was in reality a talented fellow, who, when young, was forced by financial exigency to drop out of college; he then worked as a postal clerk and schoolteacher before enlisting as a private in the Union Army in 1861.  And after four years of bloody combat, he had risen to the rank of major.Later he was elected to Congress from Ohio, and then, in '96, to the presidency.  And, once in the White House, President McKinley was then kind enough to select me as his running mate in 1900 when he sought re-election. V: And after the McKinley-Roosevelt ticket was victorious, he was assassinated. TR: Yes, he died on September 14, 1901; it was a terrible tragedy.  As I said to Congress after his death, ""He was the most widely loved man in all the United States""--except of course, by one evil anarchist, Leon Czolgosz, whom we nowadays would call a ""terrorist.""  Moreover, in paying tribute to my boss and my friend, I reminded my audience that he was no economic royalist but, rather, a true cloth-coat Republican: As I said to Congress after his deathPresident McKinley was a man of moderate means, a man whose stock sprang from the sturdy tillers of the soil, who had himself belonged among the wage-workers. V: Okay, you've convinced me: There were plenty of lunchpail Republicans back then.  So how did this image of the Republicans as the party of plutocracy get started?  Has it all been media bias?  TR: As I said, Main Street Republicanism was one strand of the Party.  Another strand was Big Business and Wall Street Republicanism.  And within the GOP, the big shots, too, had their champions, such as the dreadful Sen. Nelson Aldrich of Rhode Island, whose daughter married John D. Rockefeller, Jr.  Aldrich was a reactionary, or, as I liked to call him and his ilk, a ""malefactor of great wealth."" Sen. Nelson AldrichV: So there were two Republican parties, or sub-parties, or factions.  TR: Yes. I was astride one, and Aldrich was astride the other.  And we fought like the dickens.  When I was a young man, back in the 1880s,  the reactionary faction was known as the ""Stalwarts,"" and as for the progressive faction, we were called ""Half-Breeds."" V: I guess ""Half-Breed"" is too politically incorrect for this era.TR: Yes, I suppose so.  But by any terminological dichotomy--Main Street vs. Wall Street, mossback vs. reformer, conservative vs. progressive--the split has been real and ongoing, stretching out as it has  a century-and-a-half.  Both sides have had their victories and their defeats. From my vantage point in the Oval Office--that was a structure, by the way, that I added to the White House, as part of the West Wing, in 1902--I could see that the rising tide of discontent had to be dealt with in a constructive manner.  You see, William Jennings Bryan, a fire-breathing populist whom I loathed, had taken over the Democratic Party in 1896.  Bryan had some good ideas, such as the advancement of workers' rights, but he was also irresponsible--I thought of him as a danger to the republic. Happily, McKinley beat Bryan in the '96 presidential election, and again in '00, and yet even so, it was obvious that Bryan had a substantial constituency; the populist upswell was going to continue, because economic conditions were harsh and times were indeed hard.  So something had to be done to improve the lot of workers and farmers, all the while maintaining the basic order of things.  And I felt that I was the man to do it.  I called my policy program the Square Deal.V: Sounds a bit like the New Deal of Franklin D. Roosevelt.TR: Well, Franklin was my cousin and, I daresay, a fan of mine. V: In any case, whatever the name, your goal was to stave off all that populist energy. TR: Yes, exactly.  But I knew that I couldn't stop domestic radicalism with reaction--that just feeds it.  Instead, I had to stop radicalism with prudent preemption.   As I think Edmund Burke said, the task of the statesman is to channel the tides of change through the canals of custom.V: Ooh, I like that.  TR: Yes, I love Burke.  V: So now to antitrust? TR: I'm getting there!In that same message to Congress in 1901, delivered just three months after I was sworn into office, I took the antitrust issue head on.  I began by reiterating the basic conservative Republican wisdom of the harmony of interests, because, ultimately, all Americans are in the same boat.  As I said:The fundamental rule in our national life-the rule which underlies all others-is that, on the whole, and in the long run, we shall go up or down together. I might note that that's the sort of ""One Nation"" rhetoric used a few decades before by the great British conservative leader and prime minister, Benjamin Disraeli.  That was his big idea: He could not let his country sunder, split apart, over class divisions and class warfare.  And that's exactly what I thought, too.And yet at the same time, in our search for solutions, we couldn't go blundering around, armed only by sentiments, as opposed to sapience.  V: I love latinate words!TR: As I also said:The mechanism of modern business is so delicate that extreme care must be taken not to interfere with it in a spirit of rashness or ignorance. V: Okay, got it.  But again, where does antitrust fit in?  TR: Virgil, you seem to be in rather a hurry. When, in fact, we both are in a place where the passage of time is measured in eons.V: Yes, Colonel--I mean, Theodore--but back on earth, there's still such a thing as time-scarcity.  They're called deadlines. ###Hi, this is Virgil: Speaking of deadlines, and other matters of time-scarcity and time-urgency, this is probably a good place to take a break. We will conclude my exclusive interview with Theodore Roosevelt in the next installment. Coming in Part Three: TR explains his theory of antitrust, and adds his explanation as to why size doesn't always matter."

News of the faltering support for a handgun ban is in addition to news that support for an ""assault weapons"" ban has plummeted as well.Support for an ""assault weapons"" ban sits at 36 percent, which represents a 21 percent decline since 1996. It represents an 8 percent decline from 2012, when 44 percent of Americans supported it.Gallup offers the following explanation for the declining support of such bans:In an era of ongoing terrorist attacks and mass shootings in the U.S., Americans are now more likely to oppose an assault weapons ban than they have been in two decades. One reason may be the large increase in opposition to such a ban among Republicans. Whereas 20 years ago half of Republicans were open to such legislation, now only one in four are. But politics alone do not explain the declining support, since it has dropped among independents and Democrats as well, although on a smaller scale.It is possible this represents a backlash against calls by some in the national media and the federal government to ban certain weapons after mass shootings occur.

It was one of 23 orders Obama issued on gun violence. NAS used the book, ""Priorities for Research to Reduce the Threat of Firearm-Related Violence,"" to explain:One of these executive orders, Action #14, noted that ""in addition to being a law enforcement challenge, gun violence is also a serious public health issue that affects thousands of individuals, families, and communities across the Nation"" (White House, 2013b). This order directed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), along with other relevant federal agencies, to immediately begin identifying the most pressing research problems in firearm-related violence with the greatest potential for broad public health impact. Based on this directive, the CDC and the CDC Foundation3 requested that the Institute of Medicine (IOM), in collaboration with the National Research Council (NRC), identify questions that would define a public health research agenda for firearm violence prevention and intervention.The order was followed, and one of the first observations made by the NAS was that mass shootings are rare. They wrote:The number of public mass shootings of the type that occurred at Sandy Hook Elementary School accounted for a very small fraction of all firearm-related deaths. Specifically, since 1983 there have been 78 events in which 4 or more individuals were killed by a single perpetrator in 1 day in the United States, resulting in 547 victims and 476 injured persons (Bjelopera et al., 2013)NAS posits 78 mass shootings over a period of 30 years-an average of 2.6 a year-with a total death rate of 547, which averages roughly 18 people a year. These observations are a sober and welcome reality check when contrasted with the left's claims of ""355 mass shootings"" in one year.The ""355"" claim was ubiquitous in 2015, but delivered with special clarity by actress Rose McGowan, who tweeted, ""355 shootings this year. Well done you f**king idiots."" Mother Jones showed that McGowan overshot the number by about 351.In contrast to the dearth of mass shootings, the NAS observed that the ""Defensive use of guns by crime victims is a common occurrence."" With a caveat that the exact number of defensive gun uses is in dispute, the NAS reported:Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals, with estimates of annual uses ranging from about 500,000 to more than 3 million.The NAS points to an outlying survey that only shows defensive gun uses at 108,000, but admits the ""estimate of 108,000 is difficult to interpret"" because of the kinds of questions asked when the survey was done.The ""500,000 to more than 3 million"" figure is largely the result of the academic work of Florida State criminologist Gary Kleck. He first began publishing such figures in 1993 and, on February 17, 2015, reaffirmed that his range of defensive handgun uses continues to hold true; his work has yet to disproved with empirical evidence.Kleck actually maintains that the minimum number of defensive gun uses a year is 760,000, which works out to roughly 2,082 defensive gun uses a day.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of ""Bullets with AWR Hawkins,"" a Breitbart News podcast.

The term ""ghetto"" was widely used to describe poor black neighborhoods in the 1960s and 1970.Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., used the term twice in his ""I Have a Dream"" speech.The term is still occasionally used, especially by African American leaders and scholars. Thomas Sowell of the Hoover Institution wrote last month:The one bright spot in black ghettos around the country are the schools that parents are free to choose for their own children. Some are Catholic schools, some are secular private schools and some are charter schools financed by public school systems but operating without the suffocating rules that apply to other public schools.Not all of these kinds of schools are successes. But where there are academic successes in black ghettos, they come disproportionately from schools outside the iron grip of the education establishment and the teachers' unions.President Barack Obama used the term ""ghetto"" in his first memoir, Dreams from My Father: ""If I could just find the right words, I had thought to myself. With the right words everything could change -- South Africa, the lives of ghetto kids just a few miles away, my own tenuous place in the world.""The term is also common in popular culture, and though it is racially specific, it is not considered racially offensive.Hip-hop star Lauryn Hill once boasted, in ""Final Hour"" -- a track on the smash hit Miseducation of Lauryn Hill album -- that she had ""diplomatic immunity in every ghetto community.""Elvis Presley memorialized the term in his 1969 hit ballad ""In the Ghetto.""The term ""ghetto"" can also refer specifically to the enclosed areas in which Jews were forced to live in European cities in medieval times, and again during the Second World War.That is not how it is typically understood when used in reference to the inner city, and Jewish groups do not consider the term ""ghetto"" intrinsically offensive.This post has been updated.Joel B.

The SPLC, traffickers in blood libel and incitement to murder, is a hate group that the left counts on to smear, defame and destroy those who are brave enough to oppose their totalitarian agenda. This Soros-funded opposition research smear machine has now produced a libelous ""report"" designed to destroy the most effective anti-jihad voices and mandate that our voices are never heard.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe SPLC report says: ""These propagandists are far outside of the political mainstream, and their rhetoric has toxic consequences -- from poisoning democratic debate to inspiring hate-based violence. The Columbia Journalism Review has said as much, pointing out that misinformation and falsehoods in media 'may pollute democratic discourse, make it more difficult for citizens to cast informed votes, and limit their ability to participate meaningfully in public debate.'"" It advises reporters to ""[u]se credible sources; don't give credence to the fringe,"" and sharply criticizes ""the politicians and pundits who seek personal and ideological gain by starting or spreading false memes.""This is turning the truth on its head. The reality is this: it is the left and these well-funded Goebbels-inspired hate groups such as the SPLC that ""pollute democratic discourse, make it more difficult for citizens to cast informed votes, and limit their ability to participate meaningfully in public debate."" They work furiously to silence dissent and impose a totalitarian straitjacket on the public discourse on these issues, only allowing voices that toe their propaganda line about Islam being a religion of peace and Muslims as the victims, rather than the perpetrators, of terrorism.And they call us ""extremists,"" the same word the enemedia euphemistically uses of jihad killers -- as if we were equivalent to those who blow themselves up and cut off heads while screaming ""Allahu akbar.""All of their profiles are riddled with falsehoods, inaccuracies, and outright lies. In the one about me, their claim that I insist that Obama is the ""love child"" of Malcolm X is patently untrue. The SPLC also states that I ""have spoken to a neo-fascist group in Germany,"" when in fact I have never even been to Germany. Then they quote statements from me such as this one, ""Islam ... is an extreme ideology, the most radical and extreme ideology on the face of the earth,"" as if it were obviously false and offensive, when in reality it is true. The SPLC makes no attempt to prove that it is false. It just takes for granted that the far-left lemmings who swallow its lies will nod their heads and go along, without stopping to think that -- as murderous jihad attacks become a near-daily occurrence in Western Europe and soon in the U.S. as well -- that maybe I have a point.The SPLC also says: ""In 2013, she and Robert Spencer were banned from entering the United Kingdom to speak to an EDL rally for fear of stirring 'inter-community violence.'"" This violence was going to come from one side only: the British government was afraid that if we were there, Muslims would attack, and so to appease them, they banned us. Our ban was a tacit recognition that there is a jihad threat, not a repudiation of that threat. But the SPLC includes this anyway, knowing that their readers will not put two and two together.As the SPLC is a patent and obvious foe of the freedom of speech, it is no surprise that they would hate our Muhammad Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest (which they erroneously call ""a 'Draw the Prophet' cartoon contest""). They say it was ""an obvious provocation aimed at Muslims, who regard graphic depictions of Muhammad as blasphemous -- which drew two angry U.S.-born jihadists who were killed when they attacked the event."" So even when jihadis attack and try to kill us, the SPLC is on their side, because what we were doing was ""blasphemous."" The SPLC actually justifies murder in this case -- but you can just imagine what they would be saying if a Jew or a Christian had reacted to blasphemy against his faith by deciding to murder the ""blasphemers.""Some of their claims are bitterly ironic. As Obama ships hundreds of billions of dollars to the mullahs in Iran, the SPLC excoriates me for saying that he seeks to ""appease his Muslim overlords"" and ""wants jihad to win."" Do they not know that Iran will use those billions to fund terrorism? Or do they just not care? And they say: ""An ardent defender of Israel, Geller has described the press there as largely 'Jewicidal.'"" After recent revelations about how Soros-funded groups paid for favorable coverage of the Iran deal and the Muslim migrant invasion, and the close collaboration between the mainstream media and the Clinton campaign, is the SPLC still pretending that the enemedia is made up of fair, objective journalists?Facts are the enemy to these haters and destroyers. Facts, evidence, reality are tossed off by the SPLC like some out-of-date, old-fashioned idea. Truth is ""hate."" Truth is islamofauxbic. Anyone who criticizes oppression, subjugation, supremacism is smeared, defamed, blacklisted. Posturing as humanitarians, vicious hate groups such as the SPLC are deemed legitimate authorities by cultural and political power players.In reality, the SPLC is not a group dedicated to the defense of human rights. It is a hard-left attack machine. Vets, patriots, and freedom's defenders are in its crosshairs. Even Ben Carson was on their hate list for some time. They can't win on the facts, so they must silence us.Pamela Geller is the President of the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI), publisher of PamelaGeller.com and author of The Post-American Presidency: The Obama Administration's War on America and Stop the Islamization of America: A Practical Guide to the Resistance.

Jeff Flake Gets 2018 Primary Challenge For Opposing Donald Trump	"Arizona Senator Jeff Flake has just earned a primary challenge in 2018 because of his efforts to undermine the Republican Party's 2016 presidential nominee.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFormer Arizona state senator Kelli Ward announced on Wednesday that she will challenge Flake, whom she described as a ""big government globalist,"" in 2018. In an exclusive statement to Breitbart News, Ward said:""The #NeverTrump movement led by Sen. Jeff Flake has been an appalling example of power gone awry to the detriment of our country. We have a chance to elect a successful businessman with a plan to lead our country and Mr. Flake just can't get on board. He'd rather have another DC insider with a known history of corruption at the helm.Flake has claimed that he is not a member of #NeverTrump, even though he now says he will not vote for Donald Trump and has spent months undermining the Republican nominee's candidacy.Ward continued:Regardless of the results of the presidential election, it will take more than one election cycle to drain the swamp of big government globalists like Mr. Flake. I'm willing to work hard to make sure that Arizona has real independent Republican representation. I will need the help of all of the voters out there who want to make America great again. The only way we change DC is by changing the people we send there.The Washington Post reported in August that Flake goes out of his way to tell Arizona voters how much he ""despises"" the Republican nominee and has been ""openly hopeful"" about the prospect of working with a Clinton-Kaine administration.""Even when no one asks him about Donald Trump, Sen. Jeff Flake makes sure the audience knows how much he despises the Republican presidential nominee,"" The Washington Post reported.""He's now openly hopeful about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's dealings with Congress if she defeats Trump, boasting about his close friendship with her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) [...] He told reporters that he has 'communicated' with Kaine since the nomination and believes he could be an emissary for bipartisan deals in the Capitol during a Clinton administration.""Flake suggested that everyday voters, who express frustrations at Republican rallies with chants about what they see as Clinton's criminality, are ""crazy conspiracy"" theorists, according to the Washington Post report.Flake has also seemingly encouraged his colleagues who endorsed Trump to consider abandoning their support for the Republican nominee.When Trump questioned the objectivity of Judge Gonzalo Curiel, a member of La Raza Lawyers of San Diego, Flake suggested his colleagues use the media's pile-on as an ""opportunity"" and an ""off-ramp"" from supporting Trump.""I think there will come a time where you simply can't support him [Trump] anymore. That time came for me a while ago. There's always hope that he could change, but that hope is diminishing. So I do think this is a perfect opportunity, the off-ramp that [Sen.] Lindsey Graham talked about,"" Flake said.Throughout the race, Flake has made clear that his opposition to Trump stems in large part from Trump's policy positions. Indeed, on some of the most significant policy issues facing the nation today, Flake sides with Clinton over Trump and the American electorate. Most notably, both Flake and Clinton are proponents of the open borders trade and immigration policies supported by globalist corporate donors.""I want our Republican nominee to succeed,"" Flake told Politico in July, but ""not with the positions he has taken.""Many of the positions where Flake has expressed opposition to Trump are issues where Flake's vision is opposed by the vast majority of the Republican electorate--and the American electorate at large.Flake recently argued that Congress should ""suck up"" and ratify President Obama's Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement despite the fact that American public overwhelmingly objects to deal.In fact, public opposition to the deal was so great that Hillary Clinton-who, like Flake, had been a vocal proponent of the deal- was forced to rhetorically distance herself from it throughout the campaign.Arizona suffered a net loss of 21,000 jobs in 2015 alone due to the U.S. trade deficit with TPP countries, according to the Economic Policy Institute.Arizona lost more than a quarter of all of its manufacturing jobs since China entered the WTO- which was negotiated by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary.According to a recent POLITICO Pro-Harvard poll, 85 percent of Republicans believe that so-called ""free trade"" has lost more U.S. jobs than it has created. Only a vanishing 8 percent of Republicans believe that so-called ""free trade"" has led to higher wages for U.S. workers.Yet during a July interview with Business Insider, Sen. Flake defended Bill Clinton's controversial legacy on trade insisting, ""NAFTA is not a dirty word.""Polling data suggests otherwise. By a nearly two-to-one margin, voters said that they agree with Trump and believe that NAFTA ""is the worst trade deal in modern American history, and that TPP is almost as bad,"" according to a recent Breitbart/Gravis poll.Hillary Clinton supported NAFTA, the WTO, and China's entrance into the WTO. Like Flake, Clinton has a long record of supporting the TPP. As Bloomberg reported in 2013, Hillary Clinton took on a ""leading part in drafting the Trans-Pacific Partnership."" CNN has reported that Clinton is on the record as having praised or promoted the TPP at least 45 times.Trump has repeatedly warned American voters that if Clinton is elected President, she will ""immediately approve"" the TPP.Similarly on the issue of immigration, Sen. Flake, who supports dramatically expanding immigration levels beyond all known historical precedent, has repeatedly opposed Trump's calls for immigration controls.In July, the Arizona Senator insisted that Trump's plan to secure the southern border was not ""advisable"".""To think that we'd have a wall like Donald Trump is talking about across our 225-mile border with Mexico from California to Texas isn't very feasible, nor advisable,"" the Gang of Eight Senator said.Flake has also expressed his opposition to Trump's proposal to temporarily pause Muslim migration- despite the fact that polls show a majority of the Republican electorate supports it.Flake described Trump's desire to pause the large-scale importation of Islamic migrants-- some of whom may support anti-American ideologies that are incompatible with Western values-- as ""lunacy,"" and ""just awful, frankly.""""Just when you think he can't stoop any lower, he manages to do so,"" Flake said in December after Trump announced the proposal. ""He won't be the nominee.""In response to Trump's proposal, Flake decided to support a Democrat-backed amendment that essentially codified the claim that foreign nationals have a global right to immigrate into the United States--a principle which Clinton's campaign recently indicated she similarly supports.Sen. Jeff Sessions, who opposed the amendment, explained that it would ""constitute a transformation of our immigration system. In effect, it is a move toward the ratification of the idea that global migration is a 'human right', and a civil right... and that these so-called 'immigrants' rights' must be supreme to the rights of sovereign nations to determine who can and cannot enter their borders.""Yet Flake's longstanding support for expanding immigration levels is well documented.Most notably, in 2013, as a member of the so-called Gang of Eight, Flake worked with Sen. Marco Rubio and Sen. Chuck Schumer to pass President Obama's immigration agenda. The bill, which would have granted amnesty to the illegal population ""on day one"" of its enactment, would have also massively expanded immigration levels--dispensing 33 million green cards to foreign nationals in the span of a single decade.Similarly in January of 2015, Flake joined Rubio in co-sponsoring an extreme immigration expansion bill--known as the I-Squared Act. The bill would have allowed for a virtually unlimited expansion of Muslim immigration and of college graduates into the United States.Critics of the 2015 bill argued that its massive expansion of the controversial H-1B program would hurt American workers and would allow employers to replace them with lower-wage foreign workers.However, this might not be much of a concern for Sen. Flake. In 2015, Flake voted to confirm Attorney General Loretta Lynch after she had made clear her belief that an American worker is no more entitled to an American job than is any foreign national who is able to cross the border illegally.""I believe the right and the obligation to work is one that is shared by everyone in this country, regardless of how they came here,"" Lynch said when asked whether American citizens and lawful immigrants already here have more of a right to a U.S. job than illegal immigrants.Flake chose to support Lynch even after she had expressed her support for Obama's executive action to nullify and suspend U.S. immigration law.However, this is perhaps not surprising given that Flake did not take a firm stand in fighting President Obama's executive amnesty. In fact, as Townhall reported last year in an article entitled, ""Jeff Flake Aides Democrat Efforts To Rubber Stamp Obama's Amnesty"":""Sen. Jeff Flake sided with Senate Democrats Wednesday, pleading with Senate Republicans to abandon their effort to check President Obama's constitutional overreach, and instead rubber stamp his executive amnesty.""The article notes that in a Senate speech, Flake said that Republicans should not ""poke the president in the eye"" by using Congress' power of the purse to stop Obama's executive overreach.Flake eventually went on to vote for executive amnesty by opposing efforts to deny funding for President Obama's unconstitutional amnesty in DHS appropriations, and supporting a proposal that would provide full and unrestricted funding for the unconstitutional amnesty.For years, Flake has also been a defender of open borders. In 2014, Flake defended Jeb Bush's declaration that illegal immigration is ""an act of love"".""In a four-paragraph statement posted on Facebook, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said Bush deserves praise for his comments, saying: 'I agree with Jeb, and I applaud him for having the guts to say it,'"" Politico reported at the time.Flake praised Bush for speaking ""so humanely and unapologetically about the motivations"" of illegal immigrants-- writing that while ""some come with intent to do harm or simply take advantage of our generosity... many come to find work to feed their families. To lump everyone who crosses the border illegally into the same class is unfair and unproductive.""According to the Federation for American Immigration Reform, illegal immigration costs Arizona taxpayers roughly $2.6 billion annually.In 1960, two years before Jeff Flake was born, the foreign born population of his home state of Arizona was 70,000. By 2013, there were nearly one million foreign-born residents in Arizona (896,310), which represents a population larger than the size of San Francisco.This transformation was largely the result of a 1965 immigration bill, which lifted Calvin Coolidge's immigration caps and opened up American immigration visas to the entire world. The bill resulted in an explosion of America's foreign-born population from 9.6 million in 1965 to roughly 45 million today.Today, as a result of our federal immigration policies, the U.S. admits more immigrants in a single year than there are Jeff Flake voters in all of Arizona.Yet Flake has pushed policies to make that figure even larger, despite the fact that 92 percent of the GOP electorate, and 83 percent of the American electorate overall, would like to see immigration levels frozen or reduced.""The #NeverTrump movement led by Sen. Jeff Flake has been an appalling example of power gone awry to the detriment of our country. We have a chance to elect a successful businessman with a plan to lead our country and Mr. Flake just can't get on board. He'd rather have another DC insider with a known history of corruption at the helm.Regardless of the results of the presidential election, it will take more than one election cycle to drain the swamp of big government globalists like Mr. Flake.

A matching design was emblazoned on her breast pocket.Her friend Natalie, who works for a clothing company in Toledo, had a similarly provocative design. They told Breitbart News they were there to demonstrate against the Republican nominee's past comments about women, some of which were recorded on a live mic on the set of Access Hollywood in 2005.""I can't support a leader who doesn't value minorities and especially women. And I think the things he said are unacceptable,"" Annie said.""A president should be morally sound.

He held it aloft as Gen. Michael Flynn warmed up the crowd -- and Flynn acknowledged it from the stage, without reading aloud what the sign said.After that, several admiring fans came across to take selfies -- including Wendy Briggs, a real estate broker from Michigan, who called the slogan ""uniquely clever.""Lewinsky told Breitbart News: ""I have too may family members in the military to vote for Hillary.""His wife Krista, a full-time student, said that she had no problem with the sign -- or with Trump's past comments about women.

Her hedge fund husband Andy Hubbard remained offscreen and unmentioned as Ruhle pelted Rudy Giuliani with hostile questions about polls, healthcare policy, election rigging, endorsements, charitable spending, women voters, and eventually a question about supposed ""hate and racism"" by Trump's supporters and aides.Those charges of unethical conduct leveled at Trump stand or fall based on the evidence -- but Ruhle's own standing as an honest broker is tainted because her husband works for a hedge fund firm and previously was part of a banking conglomerate that was fined for deceptive treatment of clients during the housing bubble. Giuliani successfully caught and returned each claim and charge from Ruhle, gradually causing her to concede or change her subject. ""It is a fair point ... that is not good news [for Clinton] ... I'm not going to argue, that's some bad news there [for Clinton]... okay... you know better than me,"" she said as Giuliani volleyed his answers back at her.After 14 minutes of throw and return, Ruhle brought up vague claims of ""racism"" and ""hate,"" without offering evidence to support her scattershot questions. ""Before we go, I just want to ask you one thing. Clearly we've got an angry country... I want to talk about the hate that has been incited in this election ... I've also never seen the hate and the racism out of so many people,"" she said. Giuliani countered, saying, ""there's no racism ... to say that Donald Trump is a racist is outrageous, and to call anybody a racist is outrageous."" He quickly turned the tables, saying ""I think your [MSNBC] station is completely left wing and totally anti-Trump and totally anti-Republican ... We don't think we get anywhere fair treatment on this station.""Giuliani's charges put Ruhle on the defensive, causing her to drop her suggestions that Trump's campaign is promoting racism amid its repeated calls for pro-American policies that benefit all Americans, regardless of color.Throughout the 20-minute interview, Ruhle hid her own financial and professional interests in a victory for Hillary Clinton. Ruhle herself has close ties to major investors and employers, including Michael Bloomberg, who is a sharp critic of Trump's populist low-immigration/high-wage policies. Prior to her anchor position at MSNBC, Bloomberg picked Ruhle to be managing editor and news anchor for his television business, to be editor-at-large for his news operation, and to be co-host at for his TV show, Bloomberg GO.In July, Bloomberg scalded Trump at the Democratic convention. Trump says he'll punish manufacturers that move to Mexico or China, but the clothes he sells are made overseas in low-wage factories,"" Bloomberg said. ""He says he wants to put Americans back to work, but he games the U.S. visa system so he can hire temporary foreign workers at low wages. He says he wants to deport 11 million undocumented people, but he seems to have no problem in hiring them.Also, Ruhle's husband works as a ""managing director"" at UBS O'Connor, where he is a ""portfolio manager in credit,"" according to his LinkedIn page.

We combine our strategies with the goal of creating a diverse stream of returns relatively uncorrelated to major asset classesBy shifting capital and risk dynamically across strategies we look to exploit investment opportunity sets that we see in the marketIf elected, Trump has promised to end the so-called ""carried interest"" tax loopholesthat allows hedge fund companies to minimize taxes paid by the partners. That promise -- plus Trump's populist pitch -- has generated much hostility to Wall Street Investors.  According to a research paper by a Clinton supporter, Trump's promise of reduced immigration will lower profits by forcing up payrolls, causing a near-term drop in the stock market. The paper was released by Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, which ""helps capital markets and credit risk management professionals worldwide respond to an evolving marketplace with confidence.""Correspondingly, Hubbard's hedge fund sector and Bloomberg's investment community have strongly backed Clinton over Trump in the 2016 campaign.The Wall Street Journal reported in July that:Hedge funds are playing a far bigger role in 2016 than in past elections--and Hillary Clinton has been the single biggest beneficiary.Owners and employees of hedge funds have made $122.7 million in campaign contributions this election cycle, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics--more than twice what they gave in the entire 2012 cycle and nearly 14% of total money donated from all sources so far.The lines around what constitutes a hedge fund aren't always clear in the data, or in the financial industry. But the numbers are stark. OpenSecrets.org, the center's website, says employees or owners of hedge funds and private-equity firms contributed $27.6 million to pro-Clinton groups or her campaign, according to federal data released in July. Counting contributions from similar private investment funds, the data show seven financial firms alone have generated $47.6 million for groups working on Mrs. Clinton's behalf.The total for Donald Trump: About $19,000.On October 26, Fortune.com reported that:Wall Street is giving more money than ever to influence the outcome of the 2016 elections--but hardly any of it is going to Donald Trump. And that's doubly true of the elite managers of the nation's 1% and giant retirement plans.So far, hedge funds and their employees have contributed more than $173 million towards political campaigns for the 2016 election, more than triple the amount they gave during the last presidential election cycle in 2012, and more than eight times their contributions in 2008, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics (on which AFR based its report)...Including contributions from both hedge funds and private equity firms, Trump and groups supporting him have commanded $239,250, a more than 100-fold increase from the mere $2,054 he'd received in the first half of this year, according to the CFRP's latest data. But at the same time, Clinton has managed to win another $20 million from those funds, bringing her total hedge fund and PE firm haul to $45.2 million, up from the $25.6 million reported over the summer.Indeed, Clinton is the top beneficiary of the industry's political contributions, while Trump doesn't even rank among the top 10 recipients.During the peak bubble years from 2004 to 2014, husband Andy Hubbard was a ""Managing Director"" at Credit Suisse in New York, where he was head of ""US Structured Credit Derivatives Trading,"" according to his biography at LinkedIn.That conglomerate was hit by multiple federal lawsuits once the bubble burst. According to the federal charge filed in November 2012, ""residential mortgage-backed securities ... sponsored and underwritten by Credit Suisse in 2006 and 2007 have suffered losses of approximately $11.2 billion."" The bank, said the federal accusers""... systematically failed to adequately evaluate the loans, ignored defects that its limited review did uncover, and kept its investors in the dark about the inadequacy of its review procedures and defects in the loans. The loans in Credit Suisse's mortgage-backed securities included many that had been made to borrowers who were unable to repay the loans, were very likely to default, and ultimately did default in large numbers ... By mid-2012, cumulative losses incurred in RMBS sponsored by Credit Suisse in 2006 and 2007 totaled over $11.2 billion, or approximately 12 percent of total initial balances of approximately $93.8 billion. There is no evidence that Hubbard was involved in the mortgage problems, and also there is much evidence that the blame for the bubble can be shared with the federal government, quasi-federal agencies, progressive advocacy groups, as well as bankers and Wall Street firms.But in November 2012, Credit-Suisse agreed to pay $120 million ""to settle U.S. civil charges that they misled investors in the sale of risky mortgage bonds prior to the 2008 financial crisis, regulators said on Frida,"" according to Reuters. In March 2014, Credit-Suisse settled with a payment of $885 million to the federal government, without admitting any wrongdoing. It agreed to ""pay $885 million to settle two lawsuits with the Federal Housing Finance Authority (FHFA) over $16.6 billion of mortgage-backed securities it sold between 2005 and 2007,"" according to CNN.The property bubble had its greatest impact on Hispanic and African-American households, according to a 2011 report by the Pew Research Center. The Pew Research analysis finds that, in percentage terms, the bursting of the housing market bubble in 2006 and the recession that followed from late 2007 to mid-2009 took a far greater toll on the wealth of minorities than whites. From 2005 to 2009, inflation adjusted median wealth fell by 66% among Hispanic households and 53% among black households, compared with just 16% among white households. As a result of these declines, the typical black household had just $5,677 in wealth (assets minus debts) in 2009; the typical Hispanic household had $6,325 in wealth; and the typical white household had $113,149. Moreover, about a third of black (35%) and Hispanic (31%) households had zero or negative net worth in 2009, compared with 15% of white households. In 2005, the comparable shares had been 29% for blacks, 23% for Hispanics and 11% for whites.Read the Pew report here.

Her hedge fund husband Andy Hubbard remained offscreen and unmentioned as Ruhle pelted Rudy Giuliani with hostile questions about polls, healthcare policy, election rigging, endorsements, charitable spending, women voters, and eventually a question about supposed ""hate and racism"" by Trump's supporters and aides.Those charges of unethical conduct leveled at Trump stand or fall based on the evidence -- but Ruhle's own standing as an honest broker is tainted because her husband works for a hedge fund firm and previously was part of a banking conglomerate that was fined for deceptive treatment of clients during the housing bubble. Giuliani successfully caught and returned each claim and charge from Ruhle, gradually causing her to concede or change her subject. ""It is a fair point ... that is not good news [for Clinton] ... I'm not going to argue, that's some bad news there [for Clinton]... okay... you know better than me,"" she said as Giuliani volleyed his answers back at her.After 14 minutes of throw and return, Ruhle brought up vague claims of ""racism"" and ""hate,"" without offering evidence to support her scattershot questions. ""Before we go, I just want to ask you one thing. Clearly we've got an angry country... I want to talk about the hate that has been incited in this election ... I've also never seen the hate and the racism out of so many people,"" she said. Giuliani countered, saying, ""there's no racism ... to say that Donald Trump is a racist is outrageous, and to call anybody a racist is outrageous."" He quickly turned the tables, saying ""e don't think we get anywhere fair treatment on this station.""Giuliani's charges put Ruhle on the defensive, causing her to drop her suggestions that Trump's campaign is promoting racism amid its repeated calls for pro-American policies that benefit all Americans, regardless of color.Throughout the 20-minute interview, Ruhle hid her own financial and professional interests in a victory for Hillary Clinton. Ruhle herself has close ties to major investors and employers, including Michael Bloomberg, who is a sharp critic of Trump's populist low-immigration/high-wage policies. Prior to her anchor position at MSNBC, Bloomberg picked Ruhle to be managing editor and news anchor for his television business, to be editor-at-large for his news operation, and to be co-host at for his TV show, Bloomberg GO.In July, Bloomberg scalded Trump at the Democratic convention. Trump says he'll punish manufacturers that move to Mexico or China, but the clothes he sells are made overseas in low-wage factories,"" Bloomberg said. ""He says he wants to put Americans back to work, but he games the U.S. visa system so he can hire temporary foreign workers at low wages. He says he wants to deport 11 million undocumented people, but he seems to have no problem in hiring them.Also, Ruhle's husband works as a ""managing director"" at UBS O'Connor, where he is a ""portfolio manager in credit,"" according to his LinkedIn page.  Hubbard's branch of UBS ""is a multi-strategy hedge fund manager within UBS Asset Management,"" said the web page. By shifting capital and risk dynamically across strategies we look to exploit investment opportunity sets that we see in the marketIf elected, Trump has promised to end the so-called ""carried interest"" tax loopholesthat allows hedge fund companies to minimize taxes paid by the partners. That promise -- plus Trump's populist pitch -- has generated much hostility to Wall Street Investors.  According to a research paper by a Clinton supporter, Trump's promise of reduced immigration will lower profits by forcing up payrolls, causing a near-term drop in the stock market.   That conglomerate was hit by multiple federal lawsuits once the bubble burst. According to the federal charge filed in November 2012, ""residential mortgage-backed securities ... sponsored and underwritten by Credit Suisse in 2006 and 2007 have suffered losses of approximately $11.2 billion."" The bank, said the federal accusers""... systematically failed to adequately evaluate the loans, ignored defects that its limited review did uncover, and kept its investors in the dark about the inadequacy of its review procedures and defects in the loans. The loans in Credit Suisse's mortgage-backed securities included many that had been made to borrowers who were unable to repay the loans, were very likely to default, and ultimately did default in large numbers ... By mid-2012, cumulative losses incurred in RMBS sponsored by Credit Suisse in 2006 and 2007 totaled over $11.2 billion, or approximately 12 percent of total initial balances of approximately $93.8 billion. There is no evidence that Hubbard was involved in the mortgage problems, and also there is much evidence that the blame for the bubble can be shared with the federal government, quasi-federal agencies, progressive advocacy groups, as well as bankers and Wall Street firms.But in November 2012, Credit-Suisse agreed to pay $120 million ""to settle U.S. civil charges that they misled investors in the sale of risky mortgage bonds prior to the 2008 financial crisis, regulators said on Frida,"" according to Reuters. In March 2014, Credit-Suisse settled with a payment of $885 million to the federal government, without admitting any wrongdoing. It agreed to ""pay $885 million to settle two lawsuits with the Federal Housing Finance Authority (FHFA) over $16.6 billion of mortgage-backed securities it sold between 2005 and 2007,"" according to CNN.The property bubble had its greatest impact on Hispanic and African-American households, according to a 2011 report by the Pew Research Center. The Pew Research analysis finds that, in percentage terms, the bursting of the housing market bubble in 2006 and the recession that followed from late 2007 to mid-2009 took a far greater toll on the wealth of minorities than whites. From 2005 to 2009, inflation adjusted median wealth fell by 66% among Hispanic households and 53% among black households, compared with just 16% among white households. As a result of these declines, the typical black household had just $5,677 in wealth (assets minus debts) in 2009; the typical Hispanic household had $6,325 in wealth; and the typical white household had $113,149. Moreover, about a third of black (35%) and Hispanic (31%) households had zero or negative net worth in 2009, compared with 15% of white households. In 2005, the comparable shares had been 29% for blacks, 23% for Hispanics and 11% for whites.Read the Pew report here. "

Donald Trump has referenced it in his speeches and news media ""fact checkers"" have been furiously writing about it.Set aside for a minute how candidates might inartfully describe a complex transaction or the semantic games that might be played by ""fact checkers."" The usually curious news media is going to absurd lengths to pretend that there is nothing here so the issue will go away.Briefly, a Russian government sought federal government approval to purchase a Canadian company called Uranium One which controlled 20 percent of American uranium assets. This required the approval of several federal government agencies, because the deal involved a material (uranium) of national strategic importance.Hillary Clinton's State Department was one of those agencies which signed off on the deal.Nine shareholders connected to Uranium One contributed a combined $145 million to the Clinton Foundation before or during the time the review took place. Some of those donations were not publicly disclosed at the time, as the Clintons promised they would.These facts were revealed in my book Clinton Cash and confirmed by the New York Times in their own investigation. And reporters have not questioned these elements of the story.There are three primary defenses that Team Clinton has offered to the story that certain elements of the news media has gobbled up eagerly.There were nine agencies that reviewed this deal and approved it--so there is nothing to see. What they ignore, of course, is that no other agency head received $145 million in donations from nine shareholders in the deal. The fact that other government agencies approved this deal is irrelevant.Imagine if a jury of nine individuals is hearing a murder case and one of the jurors had financial ties to the individual on trial. If the jury came back 9-0 for acquittal, does that mean no bribery took place or no conflict of interest existed? Of course not.The Assistant Secretary of State with responsibility in this area says that Hillary was not involved in the decision, so there is nothing to see. The Clinton campaign and the news media, including Washington Post ""fact checkers,"" trot out Assistant Secretary of State Jose Fernandez to say ""Secretary Clinton never intervened with me on any CFIUS matter."" (The professionals at Time Magazine and PolitiFact both incorrectly called him Jose ""Hernandez"").Set aside the fact that Fernandez was a political appointee. Is he credible? The news media never seems to ask this question, nor ask for any evidence.Newly released emails via Wikileaks, however, provide clear evidence that Fernandez is deeply entrenched in the Clinton political operation. As he wrote to John Podesta on April 17th, 2015, ""I would like to do all I can to support Secretary Clinton, and would welcome your advice and help in steering me to the right persons in the campaign."" He also wrote John Podesta on March 30th, 2015, ""Thanks no doubt to your recommendation I have joined the CAP board of trustees, which I'm finding extremely rewarding."" Does this sound like someone who is an impartial source? Or a political operative?It's a coincidence that shareholders in Uranium One were contributors to the Clinton Foundation. One of the most ridiculous defenses of this deal that has been offered is that Uranium One was a Canadian company that just happened to send money to the Clinton Foundation. This completely ignores the fact that the Clintons helped Uranium One acquire its most important uranium assets.As the New York Times recounted in a 2008 article, Bill Clinton traveled to Kazakhstan to help Frank Giustra acquire the rights to uranium mines in Kazakhstan. After Giustra acquired those rights, Giustra sent $30 million to the Clinton Foundation.As the Washington Post further reported in 2010, the Kazakh official who authorized the transfer of those rights to Giustra said in a video deposition that he was also pressured by then-Senator Hillary Clinton to hand over those assets. So the relationship between the Clintons and Uranium One is not tangential. They were central to Uranium One becoming a uranium company, one that the Russian government would want to acquire.The lack of curiosity by the news media on this is astounding. Imagine for a moment that Donald Rumsfeld's Pentagon intervened in a matter that benefited a defense contractor and its shareholders. And imagine if nine shareholders in that company donated $145 million to a Rumsfeld family foundation. Would the news media take the word of his deputy that he didn't directly intervene in the matter? Would they say there is no story because other government agencies were involved in that decision? Of course they wouldn't.Furthermore, the media shrugs its shoulder that millions of dollars in the donations to the Clintons involving the Uranium One deal (including those from the Chairman of the company) were undisclosed. This despite the fact that they had signed a written agreement with President Obama that they would do so, and Hillary told the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the American people that she would do so.Ordinarily, ""millions in secret contributions"" gets the media moving. I guess hidden donations and flows of money involving other political figures will not be of interest in the future.We now know that the Clinton Foundation operated with a quid pro quo when it came to donations during Hillary's tenure as Secretary of State. We know this because the Podesta emails revealed an internal review of the Clinton Foundation done by the law firm Simpson Thacher which states precisely that.The review done in 2011 found that some donors ""have an expectation of quid pro quo benefits in return for gifts."" The firm went so far as to ""recommend that the Foundation establish a gift acceptance policy and procedures to ensure that all donors are properly vetted and that no inappropriate quid pro quos are offered to donors in return for contributions.""Clearly, the law firm was deeply troubled by the pay to play culture at the Foundation. There is no evidence that they implemented these suggestions.The Clinton defense in the Uranium One deal rests entirely on us taking their word for the fact that there is nothing to see. But of course, that is what they said about the email server. And we now know how widely they lied about that scandal. The fact that the news media is playing lap dog and not watch dog in this case does enormous damage to the integrity of our government.It's time for an independent federal investigation of this deal.SIGN UP"

According to the Washington Post:When asked about which health-care issue should be considered the most important for the next president and Congress, drug prices came in first -- followed by a number of other consumer issues related to health care, such as making sure that insurance plans covered enough doctors and hospitals to be useful.Nearly three-quarters of respondents said making expensive drugs affordable to chronically ill people should take priority. More than half said taking government action to lower drug prices should be at the top of the list. In contrast, repealing the Affordable Care Act was ranked as a top priority by 37 percent of people. Repealing elements of the law, such as the requirement that individuals without insurance pay a fine or that companies with 50 employees or more offer insurance or pay a penalty were also ranked as a top issue by a minority of respondents.Normally pollsters total up the number of people who want any specific part of the law repealed to produce a total percentage of voters ""unhappy with the law"" or ""favoring full or partial repeal."" The foundation's questions weren't asked in a way that would allow such easy addition, yet its list of health care priority questions show broad opposition to Obamacare's foundations Yes, the leading questions shows that 74 percent of the public want free stuff -- 'affordable drugs' - while the partly hidden lower questions show almost four in 10 say they want to chop the legs off the program. ""Repealing the requirement that nearly all Americans have health insurance or else pay a fine"" drew 38 percent support, and that's tantamount to full repeal of the Affordable Care Act, since even its die-hard defenders admit it would not survive loss of the individual mandate.It would also be noted that priorities such as ""making sure insurance plans cover enough doctors and hospitals to be useful"" are impossible under the Affordable Care Act, so anyone who supports that priority is indirectly calling for repeal of ObamaCare, whether they realize it or not. The Kaiser Family Foundation theorizes that not enough people are ObamaCare exchange customers to appreciate its alleged virtues - 10.4 million, compared to 154 million who still get insurance through their employers. But that's also the reason ObamaCare's collapse isn't ringing the bell at the top of the voter priority carnival game.Another way of putting it is that the elements of our health insurance system that were working well before ObamaCare came along are still working, and those elements cover over 90 percent of consumers. An insane amount of money was spent for very minimal benefits, and the ""unexpected side effects"" have hurt more people than ObamaCare helped. Of course the law's supporters want us to just think about the benefit of increased enrollment - which is far less than originally predicted by ObamaCare's designers - and ignore the costs. That's how Big Government programs are always sold.How about a new and better poll that asks if the money Barack Obama wasted on his health-care takeover should have been spent on reducing prescription drug prices instead? The craptacular website alone cost a billion dollars to design, crash, reboot, crash, redesign, and repair. The individual mandate was a thinly-disguised middle-class tax increase of staggering proportions... and ObamaCare's con artists want to make it even bigger now, because too many Americans persist in paying the penalty instead of buying overpriced ObamaCare policies. What might we have accomplished by putting that money into the health-care priorities of the Kaiser poll, instead of wasting it on a Democrat power grab?The Post notes that voters see health care as a lower priority than issues like the economy and foreign policy, on both sides of the partisan divide. That certainly doesn't stop the elite from ramming through its preferred legislation when it wants to take over part of the private sector, or push something beloved of the Beltway but of little interest to voters, such as amnesty for illegal aliens or global warming.The Kaiser survey was conducted between October 12 and 18, which is before the latest news about sky-high premium increases was absorbed by the public, in the middle of a hot and humid presidential campaign where ObamaCare hasn't been a major issue (which was a mistake on the part of the Trump campaign.) Interest levels might perk up a bit after sticker shock really kicks in next year.When the Democrats were pushing ObamaCare, they didn't care that most people were satisfied with their health care. They focused on the most unhappy campers, and personalized the issue with faces, names, and individual tales of hardship. That's a tactic today's reformers should reverse. Put some people who just got slammed with 100 percent premium hikes onstage, and ask if they think repealing the Affordable Care Act is a high priority.Conservatives will never have the media or bureaucratic megaphones needed to manufacture crisis-level intensity for an issue the voters don't consider high priority, but they still need to lay the groundwork for reform by presenting both the problem and good solutions. Liberals would never look at a poll showing 40 percent support for imposing a Big Government program and consider it a lost cause.One of the Kaiser questions indicates that most voters don't understand what Donald Trump proposes to do about health care reform. That's a big problem, and it reflects the Republicans' long inability to unite behind a repeal and reform plan. (They've floated a lot of proposals without unified support over the years, a lack of unity which ironically helps President Obama falsely claim they have no alternative ideas at all.)Polls like this should be useful battle maps for reformers, who won't throw in the towel even if Hillary Clinton wins the presidential election. ObamaCare will still be a bigger disaster in 2020, and Democrats should never be let off the hook for forcing it through on a party-line vote, with all sorts of ugly tricks and payoffs. Hammer that point that we could have the reforms voters really want, if we weren't wasting billions on a system hardly anyone really likes, and that even benefits like expanded coverage can be accomplished far more efficiently. ObamaCare has proven itself just about the worst possible solution to the problems that existed before 2010. Republicans must use Obamacare's chaos to argue for pro-market, pro-American reform, if only because Democrats will use Obamacare's failures to impose even more miserable, anti-market, Big Government solutions to the new problems they happily created.When asked about which health-care issue should be considered the most important for the next president and Congress, drug prices came in first -- followed by a number of other consumer issues related to health care, such as making sure that insurance plans covered enough doctors and hospitals to be useful.

Instead, they invented a new principle, which is that presidents -- or Democratic ones anyway -- only get to appoint Supreme Court justices for the first three years of their four year terms. After that, we must wait until the next president takes office, so he or she can make the appointment.At the time, I made a prediction: If Hillary Clinton gets elected, Republicans will change their minds and decide that the Supreme Court is actually working just fine with eight justices, and there's no need to rush ahead and fill that vacancy, at least not until 2021 or 2025, whenever we have our next Republican president.Now at least one senator is suggesting that this just might be just the ticket, and he's getting backup from conservative writers, as David Weigel reports:""Speaking to reporters after a campaign rally for a Republican U.S. Senate candidate here, Sen.

Seriously.Gettysburg was the Southern army's high-water mark during the Civil War. The very tip of that spear was Gen. Lewis Armistead, who fell leading Pickett's Charge up a hill toward Cemetery Ridge. It was a brave assault, but a complete and disastrous failure from which the South never recovered.General Robert E. Lee was decisively beaten and retreated south, never to return. A bitter, bitter pill for Southerners -- then and today -- who love to study the war that even now remains America's deadliest.If Mr. Trump's Gettysburg Address was supposed to be some kind of racist dog whistle to white Southerners, then he was blowing it from the wrong end.In this scenario, Mr. Trump is seeking a dramatic and decisive turnaround just as President Abraham Lincoln did seven score and 13 years ago.Certainly, Mr. Trump appears to face a hill every bit as steep as Cemetery Ridge. And the phalanx of enemy troops in the media and in politics waiting for him at the top of the ridge is every bit as formidable.His Contract with the American Voter is great, though it may have arrived on the battlefield even later than Gen. James Longstreet did in 1863. Its value in this battle may prove no more effective than those of the great cavalry commander J.E.B. Stuart.Mr. Trump's prosecution of Hillary Clinton's failed 30-year career in Washington and his promise to ""drain the swamp"" are terrific, though may not be enough to overcome the universal media hatred he faces.Whatever happens, it is good for us to remember Gettysburg and those impossibly bleak years. America survived that, and America will survive even this.Beyond that, any analogies to that great battle are a bit stretched, except perhaps one.At this point in the Civil War, President Lincoln was at the very end of his patience with generals who had such big and beautiful armies but who were apprehensive about sending them into battle. After Union Gen. George Meade repulsed Gen. Lee's attack at Gettysburg, he failed to aggressively go on the offense and destroy Gen. Lee's army once and for all before he could escape back into Virginia.The war would grind on for another year and nine horrific months.It all changed when President Lincoln finally found General Ulysses S. Grant, who was a coarse, brash and impolitic general. But he was aggressive, and that is what President Lincoln wanted.All his other generals and his entire war cabinet -- the media and political elite of that day -- gasped in horror that Mr. Lincoln would hand such a prestigious position over to such a brute and unsophisticated man.""But he is a drunkard!"" they declared. To which Mr. Lincoln responded: ""Find out what kind of whiskey he drinks and send a barrel to every one of my commanders.""Gen. Grant may not have been pretty, and he would go on to helm one of the most corrupt presidencies in U.S. history.But he saved the Union.* Charles Hurt can be reached at charleshurt@live.com; follow him on Twitter via @charleshurt.SIGN UP"

So the green-eyeshade politics promoted by Charles Koch and David Koch are a rational match for their business needs -- they favor small governments, low taxes, low spending, and free trade, plus egalitarian social policies that gradually overlap with the progressives' radical demands for unlimited immigration and sexual revolution.But the 2016 election shows that the Koch's package of business and politics, however productive and principled, is no longer good enough for most Americans. Voters want protection from the corrosive impact of unrestricted free-trade and unrestricted immigration that are favored by the alliance of progressives and executives.In interviews, some [Koch]insiders traced the network's decline -- or at least its decline in growth -- to its decision to sit out the presidential race, at first out of disagreement over whether to play in the crowded GOP primary, and then out of distaste for Trump...Asked about his comments at the staff meeting, [Mark Holden] acknowledged that ""we've had very little success moving the needle at the federal level. It's always difficult."" But, he added ""we have had a lot of success at the state level and we hope that we will continue to do so.""Ironically, though, some Koch insiders and critics alike agree that the conditions that are now challenging the Kochs are in some ways of their own creation. By helping to empower the anti-establishment tea party protests in 2009 and 2010, these people say, the Koch network inadvertently laid the groundwork for a movement that turned towards a strain of anti-immigrant protectionism that is anathema to the Koch's ideology, and that proved fertile ground for Trump's nationalist brand of populism.""We are partly responsible,"" said one former network staffer. ""We invested a lot in training and arming a grassroots army that was not controllable, and some of these people have used it in ways that are not consistent with our principles, with our goal of advancing a free society, and instead they have furthered the alt-right."" ...""What we feel really badly about is that we were not able to educate many in the tea party more about how the process works and how free markets work,"" said the donor. ""Seeing this movement that we were part of creating going off in a direction that's anti-free-market, anti-trade and anti-immigrant -- many of us are really saddened by that. Unfortunately, there is little in the short term we can do about that."" The rise of populism in 2015 and 2016 was a surprise to many GOP-affiliated legislators, donors, intellectuals and lobbyists, despite the growing evidence from polls and media anecdotes. And the Koch network announced its jaw-dropping $889 million spending goal at a January 2015 gathering of its donors. It invited a handful of likely Republican presidential candidates -- a group that did not include Trump, who was then considered a political sideshow -- whose politics were deemed compatible with the Kochs. Not only was the network preparing to play a major role in the presidential general election, but it was openly toying with the prospect of wading into a GOP presidential primary for the first time ever.All that careful planning was upended, though, when Trump unexpectedly surged to the front of the field. The Koch network couldn't agree on a consensus alternative candidate to back. And, while sources say Charles Koch and his top lieutenants debated proposals to spend tens of millions of dollars to try to stop Trump, they ultimately decided against it.The Politico article does not describe any efforts by the Koch brothers to sketch a compromise deal with the populist movement -- for example, less cheap-labor immigration and tighter trade rules packaged with less business regulation and lower taxes -- even though populist Americans are far more sympathetic to free-market business leaders than are progressive groups or immigrant communities.Read it all here.
