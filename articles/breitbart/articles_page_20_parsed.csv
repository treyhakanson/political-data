Many of these were originally barred from firearm possession ""after being accused of stalking and beating their partners."" The majority of those who lost their licenses were people who ""had a 'final' family violence order made against them for violence or stalking, and those found guilty of other indictable offences.""This is huge news in light of of the fact that Hillary Clinton praised Australia's approach to gun control while talking to New Hampshire voters on October 16, 2015. Australia's approach rests on confiscating guns-as they did in 1996/1997-then allowing limited gun ownership based on strict government oversight of select firearms. Part of the government oversight includes licensing for all gun owners. Clinton said this system was ""worth looking at"" for gun policy in America.Yet the Herald makes clear that such a system is allowing alleged domestic abusers to retain their firearms.This news comes just weeks after Breitbart News reported that gun violence in Melbourne was surging, that Melbourne had witnessed more than one shooting a week on average since January 2015.The Age reports Melbourne's gun crime explosion, saying:On October 21, the Australian government admitted hundreds of thousands of ""illegal guns"" are in Australia. Reuters reported that a new amnesty will be put in place in hopes of encouraging the surrender of the guns.When Australia put forward its confiscatory gun policy in 1996, the NRA warned it would not succeed in disarming criminals. Rather, it would simply disarm law-abiding citizens, leaving them at the mercy of the criminal element. It appears the NRA was right.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of ""Bullets with AWR Hawkins,"" a Breitbart News podcast.

Trump winning the White House in today's election.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAcross the country, 80 percent of Americans are fed up with a ruling elite that has manipulated the system for their own gain, Caddell told Schilling, who hosts Whatever It Takes weekdays from from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m., broadcast live on Breitbart.com.
Call into the show: (877) 240-1776Trump has tapped into the unrest and turmoil that so many Americans are going through, but it is not reflected in the mainstream media, nor do their leaders address it or try to understand it.""They want their country back and that instinct is one of the most powerful forces, historically,"" he said.Caddell said he would compare 2016 to 1828, when Andrew Jackson overthrew an entrenched elite.Schilling said that he based his own predictions of a Trump win on the under-recording of the Trump vote in the polls. ""I went to the electoral map and I added five percent to Trump's total and in every state where he was within 4.9 percent or in the lead, I gave him the win.""The fireballer told Caddell his call for the night was: Trump 322 and Clinton 216.Here is my electoral map. pic.twitter.com/9v2cVsZyTl-- Curt Schilling (@gehrig38) November 8, 2016""Numbers matter to me,"" he said to the pollster. ""You've seen the data. You've lived inside the data. You understand the data in ways other people don't.""What do the numbers tell you, he asked.Caddell warmed to the task: ""The numbers I've been seeing-and I've been trying to go in depth-you know, we did some surveys with Gravis and I helped consult on that-we polled attitude and in depth questions, because when you have a close election, I care less about the surface numbers and more about the in depth attitudes the people will decide on.""The man who was the pollster consulting for three consecutive Democratic nominees, 1972, 1976 and 1980-with a strong second place in 1984-said up until the last minute, there are many undecideds, but their views are revealed in the attitude questions.Seven to 10 percent of the electorate is still undecided going into Election Day and they dislike both Trump and his Democratic opponent Hillary R. Clinton, he said.But, on the big issues, such as trade policies, immigration, and the economy, they are with Trump, he said.""If they vote what they think, they will be swinging to Trump, they will be swinging not because they are for Trump, these last deciders,"" he said. ""But, because it is the uprising of the American  people.""Caddell said, ""It is going to be an interesting and long, majorly historical evening tonight.""Join Curt Schilling weekdays from 9 a.m to 11 a.m. as he hosts Whatever It Takes, broadcast live at Breitbart.com.Here is my electoral map. pic.twitter.com/9v2cVsZyTl

He is the only U.S. Army General to have served a year as a combat advisor embedded in a Kurdish Peshmerga brigade. He explained what would have happened to him or someone in his command if they had been ""extremely reckless"" handling classified information.There is no question that my career as a US Army officer would have ended. Period. I would have gone from General to Mister practically overnight. Saying, ""Oops, I didn't meant to,"" while perhaps interesting, would be less than meaningless. Public servants, and especially military leaders, are held to a high standard. The lives of brave Americans demand it. It is our duty to ensure such leakage of classified material never occurs on our watch, and if it occurs intentionally, then prepare for an all expenses paid visit to the prison at Fort Leavenworth.Retired Airforce Major General Bentley Rayburn has campaigned for Trump in Colorado and joined about two dozen other Generals, Admirals, and Medal of Honor Recipients in North Carolina in the final week before the campaign. General Rayburn didn't mince his words calling Clinton a ""criminal"" and explained how he had to fire a secretary for far less damaging breaches of classified protocol.""Hillary is a criminal. The way she handled classified information is criminal and to have a commander in chief who so blatantly disregarded those national security procedures would be a big problem for the military,"" Rayburn said.Asked if he expects people charged with mishandling classified information to use the ""Hillary defense,"" General Rayburn scoffed, ""They already have. They didn't get very far because their last name isn't Clinton.""Retired Army Lt. General Michael Flynn told Breitbart News that Clinton placed the country in ""grave risk"" with her handling of State secrets.""It was a violation of the law. It's not just violation of State Department guidelines,"" Flynn told SiriusXM host Matthew Boyle. ""Let's forget about the pedophilia, let's forget about the Clinton Foundation for a second and let's focus on Hillary Clinton's grave risk that she's placed our country at by using a private server to do business at the most sensitive levels of our government.""The General's issues with Clinton don't end with Clinton's ""extremely reckless"" handling of classified information. Clinton's foreign policy during her tenure as Secretary of State in the Obama administration was characterized as ""terrible,"" ""awful,"" and ""a disaster"" by the Generals.""Even if you could set aside the classified information breaches, her foreign policy during her time as Secretary of State --"" General Rayburn said. ""It's clear they didn't understand the situation in the Middle-East and made a mess of it. They rushed out of Iraq by failing to get a Status of Forces agreement. They didn't understand the Arab Spring. They didn't understand the divide between Sunni and Shia. They didn't understand or stop the persecution of Christians. Foreign Policy under Clinton and Obama was terrible and if God forbid she gets in office it will still be terrible.""General Audino worried that the Clinton/Obama strategy of alienating our allies and embracing our enemies would continue under a Clinton presidency.While she was Secretary of State, U.S. foreign policy left our long-term allies wondering if we had their back. They are wondering if they can ever trust the USA again. Egypt is wondering if we've got their back.  Saudi Arabia is wondering if we've got their back. The Kurds are wondering if we've got their back. We've drawn red lines in the sand and then chickened out. All of this and more has seriously undermined our diplomatic power, one of the four elements of national power. The other three being military, economic and information.General Flynn made it clear how high the stakes are in this election, telling Breitbart's Matthew Boyle, ""It's more than the most important presidential election in our lifetimes. It's one of the most important in the history of our country. You can rattle off guys like George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, both Teddy and Franklin Roosevelt. Ronald Reagan. This raises to that level, because our country is either going to become a socialist country or we're going to continue on a path to prosperity with Donald Trump.""Dustin Stockton is a political reporter for Breitbart News, a community liaison for Gun Owners of America, and a political strategist.

Klein said:Let me give you an example of what you're talking about. After I left the New York Times in 1988 - that's a long time ago - I started writing books. I wrote a lot of books about the Kennedys. And I was on ABC, CBS, NBC, Charlie Rose, CNN. They loved me. They invited me back. I was the toast of the town, quote-unquote. And then I wrote a book called The Truth About Hillary. One night, shortly after I wrote that book, I got a phone call as my wife and I were dressing to go to a dinner party, and it was from the host of the dinner party - a guy whose name I will not mention on air.Klein recalled how his friend rescinded his invitation to the party at the guest of honor's request, explicitly because he had written a book critical of the Clintons.""He said, 'Well, I'm sorry.' and so we were disinvited to that party, and from then on, I have been the guy who the mainstream media types in this city will have nothing to do with,"" Klein concluded. ""In fact, people whom I've know for all my professional life, when I see them in a restaurant or run into them on the street, often will pass by without saying 'Hi.'"" ""Now, I don't know any conservative or Republican who behaves that way.

""But I think the most important one is that if you look at what underlies, or the basis, the foundation of the so-called progressive Left, it is if I am for women, minorities, homosexuals, the put-upon of the world - well, I'm a good guy, and you should vote for me. So therefore this gives them the power. It's all about power. Because they use this so-called ideology of the put-upons in order to get votes.""

You've been voting for them because they've been promising you that they love you, that they care about you, that you're their brother, et cetera, et cetera. But it's all about getting your vote.

""If you look at what is motivating both sides in Washington--this is what Donald's been talking about--it's the perpetuation of their power, of their position, of their status.

That's Donald.

He said that after he published this news at the Daily Mail Online, the White House was contacted for a comment, and the response was ""a twenty-page screed from the deputy White House press secretary, who had put together every single website knock on me, absolute low-level 'Ed Klein is the Devil, the Evil.'"" He found some amusement in the White House investing so much time compiling such a dossier of criticism.Klein expressed sympathy for Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer, who also received shabby treatment from an ""absolutely corrupt"" media establishment after writing a book strongly critical of the Clintons. He went on to say:I feel for Peter Schweizer because he worked so hard, and he put his finger on what I think a lot of people have forgotten: now that the FBI Director, James Comey, has said in his absolutely herky-jerky that he's - you know, investigating, he's not investigating, he's investigating again, and now he's not investigating - what we've forgotten is that the FBI still has an ongoing investigation, and it has for almost two years, of the Clinton Foundation, and that's still ongoing.

And just over 10 months later, one of the most prominent gun stores in the city is laying off employees and has already ""taken a $2 million hit in sales so far in 2016.""SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBreitbart News previously reported that the violence tax places a five-cent tax on every bullet sold within city limits and a $25 tax on every gun. The tax was pushed by City Council president Tim Burgess and passed by the Seattle City Council on August 10, 2015. Seattlepi reports that Mike Coombs, the owner of Sodo's Outdoor Emporium, is now watching his business decline.In addition to the $2 million loss in sales, Coombs has seen his ""customer count"" tumble by 32 percent during 2016. At the same time, Seattle residents are going outside city limits to buy the guns and ammunition they need.When Burgess first introduced the tax, he claimed it would offset the expense of caring for gunshot victims. He pointed to healthcare costs in 2014 as a justification for forcing the gun industry to pay its fair share.But Breitbart News was quick to point out that Burgess missed the point: He failed to consider the fact that the tax would not be paid by gun or ammo makers but by law-abiding citizens purchasing guns and ammo at retail outlets. Now gun store employees are losing their jobs.Seattle refuses to release figures to show how much revenue the violence tax has garnered during the first 10 months of its existence, so Dave Workman and the Second Amendment Foundation have filed suit to force release of the information. Seattlepi has also filed a ""public records request"" regarding tax revenue, but has received no information to date.Tax sponsor Tim Burgess said the city does not want to release information on tax revenue until the gun and bullet tax has been in effect for a full year.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of ""Bullets with AWR Hawkins,"" a Breitbart News podcast.

Trump came out ahead of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton with 32 votes to Clinton's 25 between the Dixville Notch, Hart's Location and Millsfield communities of the New England region stateTrump came out far ahead in Millsfield with a commanding 16-4 lead over Clinton with one write-in vote going to the man that lost to Clinton in the primaries, Sen. Bernie Sanders. Clinton came out slightly ahead in two towns. The local news station reported that Clinton received four votes to Trump's two in Dixville Notch where Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson received a vote and failed 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney received one write-in. Though he had teased running in 2016 and later harshly criticized nominee Trump, Romney was not a 2016 candidate.Clinton took 17 votes to Trump's 14 in Hart's Location, New Hampshire. There Johnson pulled out three votes while former 2016 candidates Sanders and Ohio Gov. John Kasich received one write-in vote each. Sanders and Kasich both lost their party's primary elections.Hart's Location, New Hampshire touts its position as ""The Smallest Town in New Hampshire and the First in the Nation to Vote"" on its website. The site states that the community started the tradition of early in the day voting, 7 a.m., in 1948 as a way to accommodate railroad workers and their families. By 1952 they had moved the time up to midnight. With growing media attention over the practice, residents voted to stop the practice in 1964, however it was reinstated in 1996.In 2012, Hart's Location chose Democratic President Barack Obama to continue in a second term over Republican nominee Romney by a margin of 23-9. According to 11Alive News, the town also chose Obama in 2008, chose Bob Dole in 1996 and George Bush in 2000 and 2004.Tiny Dixville Notch recorded only eight votes according to results reported by the local news outlet, half of which went to Clinton over Trump's two. The report stated that the town voted consistently for Republicans from 1960, including Barry Goldwater who lost overwhelmingly to Lyndon Johnson. Their Republican trend ended in 2008 when Obama was favored and in 2012 the vote there was down the line between Obama and Romney.Trump and Clinton have been fighting hard for the swing state's four electoral votes that could help decide the fate of the election.Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana SIGN UP"	['Sanders', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Romney', 'Kasich', 'Obama']	[]

Groner and NDRC Vice Chairman Wang Xiaotao signed 15 cooperation agreements while an additional 15 deals were signed between businessmen from both countries.Groner told nrg that Israel and China have plenty to offer one another and as such it is crucial that the countries are on the same page.Groner added that tourism between China and Israel has been exploding on both ends.""The government's objective to bring 100,000 tourists per year from China by 2019 is exceeding expectations,"" he said, ""to the point that this might be achieved as early as 2017.""To that end, Israel's Ministry of Tourism has allocated some NIS 700,000 ($184,000) in grant money for students of East Asia to train in an official tour-guide course.However, according to Ynet, Incoming Tour Operators Association CEO Yossi Fattal said that the increase in tourism from China isn't necessarily a good thing and has led to the hijacking of jobs in the construction and tourism industries.

We're doing great in Michigan. They're great people, and the car business has been taken away, and so much has happened.""""We were in New Hampshire, which was incredible, at the big arena. It was packed,"" Trump continued. ""I mean, it was just packed with thousands of people outside. The energy in New Hampshire was unbelievable. And then we hopped in the plane, we flew to Michigan, we got there at about 12:30, almost 1:00 in the morning. It had to have close to 30,000 people, inside and out. The energy is incredible.""Marlow noted that Trump has been holding big rallies in traditionally ""blue"" states during the last days of his campaign, and asked for his thoughts on expanding the Republican ""big tent"" to include more longtime Democratic constituencies.""You have to do it,"" said Trump. ""You know, we're at a tremendous disadvantage in the Electoral College. As you know, she starts off with like about 240; her number's around 240 before she starts. The Republicans are at a tremendous disadvantage. But I have a great relationship with New Hampshire, as an example. A great relationship with various places like North Carolina, which I guess you could say is purple, but I think we're gonna do great there, and so many of the others.""""And I think we're gonna do fantastically in Michigan,"" he predicted. ""Michigan is, you know, the cars, that industry was ripped out of Michigan, so much of it, and moved to Mexico and other places. The people understand. And I've been talking about it, Alex, for five years. You know, I got Man of the Year in Michigan about five or six years ago. In my speech, I was talking about that. It had nothing to do with it, but I was talking about it, and they know how I feel. And then the polls started coming out, as you know, and we are up I think two points in Michigan, which is shocking to people, because in theory, that was a very blue state. Very blue.""""She heard about it, and she went there last night, too, but she's not gonna stop what's happening to the state,"" he said of Clinton. ""And there are some others. We seem to be doing very well in certain blue states. Maybe a lot of them.""Marlow asked for the agenda in the first hundred days of the Trump administration, and what he expected from the lame-duck session of Congress, should he win the election.""We have a lot of different things,"" Trump replied. ""First of all, we have to strengthen our borders. We need border security. We have to start building up our military. We have to take care of our vets. We have to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare - so important. It is such a disaster, Obamacare. And you're seeing it. I know it's a subject that you guys cover a lot. You see the rate increases, the premium increases - as an example, Arizona, 116 percent increase. Minnesota, 60 percent. You have these increases all over the place, and it came up just before the election, but everyone was suffering [from] them; they all understand, but it seemed to be a very big subject. I think it's one of the reasons that we are doing so well, the Obamacare. It's a disaster. And it's no good. It doesn't work. I mean, you can't even use it, the deductibles are so high.""""So we will repeal and replace Obamacare. We'll get a health care that's fabulous, like great, and that's for a fraction of the cost,"" Trump promised. ""This is crazy.""Marlow mentioned two constituencies Trump is likely to have trouble with at the polls: NeverTrump Republicans and Latino voters. However, he thought Latino voters might ""come out more for you than people have anticipated"" because the Democrats' appeal to the Latino constituency has been so condescending.""Why do the Democrats expect them to vote for policies from the countries that they left?"" Marlow wondered.""I think we're gonna do much better with the Hispanics or Latinos than anyone expects,"" Trump agreed. ""They're great people, and I think we're gonna do very well. It's already been borne out. As an example, last week, I received the primary award from the Cuban Bay of Pigs Association. They gave me this incredible award because of what I do and all. That's an indication. With the Cubans, I can tell you, we're like at 85 percent. But I think we're gonna do very well with the Hispanics, and frankly, with the African Americans. I think we're doing really well. You see what's going on. And she's not doing well. She's very uninspiring, and she is not doing well at all.""""So it'll be a very interesting evening, I think. Don't you think?"" Trump said.When Marlow noted the contrast between Hillary Clinton's campaign rhetoric about ""unity"" and her sneering dismissal of Trump's voters as ""deplorables,"" Trump said, ""Yeah, 'deplorables,' 'irredeemable,' you know, a few little beauties like that.""""Look, I think she would not be a good president,"" he contended. ""I think that she's not an inspiring person. Our country is very divided, as you know. We're gonna bring great unity to the country. I think we're going to do a fantastic job. I know we're gonna do a fantastic job with jobs.""""We went to Michigan last night, you heard. It was incredible. There had to be close to 30,000 people there, and it was at one o'clock in the morning,"" he repeated. ""They want their jobs back. They want their auto industry to come back. A lot of it's left for Mexico. It's leaving as we speak. So I think that unity is very, very important. I agree with her on that. I just don't think that she is going to be able to unify this country.""Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.LISTEN:SIGN UPTrump said he's feeling ""unbelievable energy"" from the crowds at his rallies as the presidential race comes to an end.""We had to have close to 30,000 people in Michigan at one o'clock in the morning,"" he said, ""because, you know, we added it on at the end. We're doing great in Michigan. They're great people, and the car business has been taken away, and so much has happened.""""We were in New Hampshire, which was incredible, at the big arena. It was packed,"" Trump continued. ""I mean, it was just packed with thousands of people outside. The energy in New Hampshire was unbelievable. And then we hopped in the plane, we flew to Michigan, we got there at about 12:30, almost 1:00 in the morning. It had to have close to 30,000 people, inside and out. The energy is incredible.""Marlow noted that Trump has been holding big rallies in traditionally ""blue"" states during the last days of his campaign, and asked for his thoughts on expanding the Republican ""big tent"" to include more longtime Democratic constituencies.""You have to do it,"" said Trump. ""You know, we're at a tremendous disadvantage in the Electoral College. As you know, she starts off with like about 240; her number's around 240 before she starts. The Republicans are at a tremendous disadvantage. But I have a great relationship with New Hampshire, as an example. A great relationship with various places like North Carolina, which I guess you could say is purple, but I think we're gonna do great there, and so many of the others.""""And I think we're gonna do fantastically in Michigan,"" he predicted. ""Michigan is, you know, the cars, that industry was ripped out of Michigan, so much of it, and moved to Mexico and other places. The people understand. And I've been talking about it, Alex, for five years. You know, I got Man of the Year in Michigan about five or six years ago. In my speech, I was talking about that. It had nothing to do with it, but I was talking about it, and they know how I feel. And then the polls started coming out, as you know, and we are up I think two points in Michigan, which is shocking to people, because in theory, that was a very blue state. Very blue.""""She heard about it, and she went there last night, too, but she's not gonna stop what's happening to the state,"" he said of Clinton. ""And there are some others. We seem to be doing very well in certain blue states. Maybe a lot of them.""Marlow asked for the agenda in the first hundred days of the Trump administration, and what he expected from the lame-duck session of Congress, should he win the election.""We have a lot of different things,"" Trump replied. ""First of all, we have to strengthen our borders. We need border security. We have to start building up our military. We have to take care of our vets. We have to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare - so important. It is such a disaster, Obamacare. And you're seeing it. I know it's a subject that you guys cover a lot. You see the rate increases, the premium increases - as an example, Arizona, 116 percent increase. Minnesota, 60 percent. You have these increases all over the place, and it came up just before the election, but everyone was suffering [from] them; they all understand, but it seemed to be a very big subject. I think it's one of the reasons that we are doing so well, the Obamacare. It's a disaster. And it's no good. It doesn't work. I mean, you can't even use it, the deductibles are so high.""""So we will repeal and replace Obamacare. We'll get a health care that's fabulous, like great, and that's for a fraction of the cost,"" Trump promised. ""This is crazy.""Marlow mentioned two constituencies Trump is likely to have trouble with at the polls: NeverTrump Republicans and Latino voters. However, he thought Latino voters might ""come out more for you than people have anticipated"" because the Democrats' appeal to the Latino constituency has been so condescending.""Why do the Democrats expect them to vote for policies from the countries that they left?"" Marlow wondered.""I think we're gonna do much better with the Hispanics or Latinos than anyone expects,"" Trump agreed. ""They're great people, and I think we're gonna do very well. It's already been borne out. As an example, last week, I received the primary award from the Cuban Bay of Pigs Association. They gave me this incredible award because of what I do and all. That's an indication. With the Cubans, I can tell you, we're like at 85 percent. But I think we're gonna do very well with the Hispanics, and frankly, with the African Americans. I think we're doing really well. You see what's going on. And she's not doing well. She's very uninspiring, and she is not doing well at all.""""So it'll be a very interesting evening, I think. Don't you think?"" Trump said.When Marlow noted the contrast between Hillary Clinton's campaign rhetoric about ""unity"" and her sneering dismissal of Trump's voters as ""deplorables,"" Trump said, ""Yeah, 'deplorables,' 'irredeemable,' you know, a few little beauties like that.""""Look, I think she would not be a good president,"" he contended. ""I think that she's not an inspiring person. Our country is very divided, as you know. We're gonna bring great unity to the country. I think we're going to do a fantastic job. I know we're gonna do a fantastic job with jobs.""""We went to Michigan last night, you heard. It was incredible. There had to be close to 30,000 people there, and it was at one o'clock in the morning,"" he repeated. ""They want their jobs back. They want their auto industry to come back.
