Christian Adams: Protecting Clinton Is Latest Scandal for Obama’s Politicized Justice Department	"On Thursday's Breitbart News Daily, SiriusXM host Alex Marlow asked former Justice Department official J. Christian Adams about the latest news coming out of the DOJ, including recent revelations that a best friend of Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta is ""one of the top dogs investigating the Clintons right now.""SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERMarlow found this to be ""corruption of a level that, even for the Clintons, [he is] frankly surprised by.""""Yeah, well, see, I was at DOJ, so I'm not. I'm not surprised by it,"" Adams sighed. ""Look, it started with the New Black Panther case that, you remember, I was involved in, and there, politics and ideology affected law enforcement. The ideological opposition to using the Voting Rights Act against people like the New Black Panthers led to that case getting scuttled after we brought it during the Bush administration, after the inauguration in 2009."" ""It's the same thing here, Alex. It's ideological allies in positions of power, like this clown who's the Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs tipping off the Clinton campaign of a pending pleading being filed,"" he continued. ""This wasn't tipping them off about a hearing. Yeah, that's no big deal. But this was a piece of confidential information that a lawyer had, as a lawyer, and he gave it away unethically to the Clinton campaign.""Adams was blunt about the only recourse left to the American people in the face of such corruption: ""Trump is the only guy who can do anything about it - but I'm afraid, Alex, he doesn't even understand the scope of the problem at Justice.""""This is not just replacing one or two political appointees, and you can assume the problem is solved,"" he explained. ""I was at Justice during the Bush administration. There are eight political appointees in a division with 900 employees. That's it. So what we have is a situation where the Left has burrowed in to the career civil service ranks, and there's nothing you can do about them. So you have to pick political appointees who are aggressive, who are not insiders, who know how to work the system. They have to have experience in the bureaucracy, and they have to be ideological soldiers. If you don't do that, nothing's going to change, even if you're trying to hashtag-DrainTheSwamp.""Adams stressed that the DOJ must become politically neutral again. ""It has to be a neutral part of the government because it's the law enforcement arm. It's the most powerful agency in all of the federal government. Nothing gets done without DOJ. If you don't like energy policy, labor policy, whatever, it all goes through DOJ. You're seeing that with the State Department email litigation because DOJ is calling the shots,"" he said.""So what has happened, Alex, is the same thing that's happening to our law schools. They are becoming radicalized by institutional leftist professors who view the law as a tool to get and obtain and keep power,"" he charged. ""And so, therefore, the law is not a neutral arbiter. It's this weapon to be used by one side against the other. And those people are now lawyers at the Justice Department who believe this. I'm not sure it's easily undone.

But Eagles wide receiver Josh Huff, originally from Houston, sees it differently.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERHe keeps a handgun ""with hollow point bullets"" on his person for protection.Huff made news on November 1, when police found an ""unloaded 9mm handgun"" in his car after cops pulled him over for speeding on the New Jersey side of the Walt Whitman Bridge.Huff said, ""I'm a professional athlete. What professional athlete don't have a gun? I have a wife and I have a son at home. My job is to protect them at all costs, and my job is to protect myself as well, even though I know I have security here, but I have to protect myself as well.""Huff stressed that he does not carry the gun onto or into the NFL's prohibited areas, but he does keep one with him otherwise.He said:I'm from Houston. You can't trust a lot of people in Houston. There's always somebody out to get you. You've got to protect yourself. Even when I'm back in Houston, I always have a gun on me, because there's been several instances in Houston where I've lost a friend to gun violence, and he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, so why would I let that happen to me?The NFL's anti-gun policy not only includes discipline for violating a league ban on gun possession but also for violating ""public law"" regarding guns. The policy reads, ""If you violate this policy on guns and other weapons, you are subject to discipline, including suspension from playing. And if you violate a public law covering weapons -- for example, possession of an unlicensed firearm -- you are not only subject to discipline, including suspension from playing, but also subject to criminal prosecution.""But Huff is standing his ground and stresses his belief that ""everybody in the Eagles locker room and around the league carries a gun.""

John McCain (R-Ariz.), and numerous conservative pundits.Now, as Republicans face up to the specter of a Hillary Clinton presidency, Trump's numbers are on the rise. But polling experts caution that he is still a few points shy of where he needs to be....Two of the main tracking polls, from ABC News/Washington Post and IBD/TIPP, saw Trump moving up within the past couple of weeks.The first IBD tracking poll appeared on Oct. 19 and showed Trump receiving the support of 82 percent of Republicans.

""They are fighting in Syria only against the rebels and not against ISIS.""It was not clear what the source of Dichter's information was, but he receives intelligence briefings in his role.In Syria, Iran also has the support of the Lebanese militia Hezbollah, which has long experience in the region, particularly against Israel. It is not clear how many Hezbollah fighters are in Syria, but Dichter said 1,600 had been killed.""The Iranians enlisted Hezbollah ... to fight in Syria because the Iranian army is better suited to fight as an army against another army, while the Hezbollah militants are adept at fighting against terror groups,"" he said.""The fighting has made (Hezbollah) a better fighting force and more adept in conventional military warfare.""The briefing covered the fallout from the conflict, including the flow of migrants and refugees to Europe. Dichter cautioned that European states should not be naive about who was attempting to enter their borders.Israel has long seen Iran as its greatest threat and campaigned hard against U.S.-led efforts to strike a nuclear deal with Tehran. At the same time, Israel frequently plays up the improving relations it has with some Sunni Arab states in the region, including Egypt and, to an extent, Saudi Arabia.Dichter told the delegation that Iran's ""dream"" was to rule the Islamic holy sites of Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia.""Everybody should ask themselves why the Iranians are building missiles with a range of 2,000 km, twice the distance (from their territory) to Israel,"" he said.""Egypt is also within their range, as is Saudi Arabia. Two thousands years ago, Iran was an empire and now it wants to recreate that.""Echoing a common refrain from center- and right-wing Israeli lawmakers, Dichter said that was why Israel was convinced Iran had not abandoned its nuclear aspirations but only put them on hold, playing a long game against the West.SIGN UP"

The poll was conducted on October 27-29, a day before and after news broke the FBI announced it is reopening the investigation into Clinton private email server.According to the poll, 49 percent have an unfavorable opinion of Clinton, a three percent increase from the Siena poll that shows her at 46 percent unfavorability. As for favorable view, Trump ratings have improved, receiving a 36 percent favorable in the McLaughlin survey, a 10 point increase since the Siena poll that had Trump with a 26 percent favorable rating.One third of those surveyed identified themselves as Republicans, while 48 percent stated they are Democrats and 20 percent are registered Independent.When asked what will be the most important factor in deciding their vote, 41 percent said Clinton's corruption and dishonest will affect their vote. Over 39 percent of Independent voters find this more a motivating factor, a sign as the corruption scandals intensifies can be problematic for Clinton to win the Independent vote.By party, both candidates received over 70 percent of the vote by their respective party -- 72 percent of Republicans will vote for Trump, while 75 percent of Democrats say they will vote for Clinton. However, regarding the independent vote, Trump leads Clinton 40 percent to 36 percent.When breaking down the votes in the New York area, Trump leads Clinton in the suburbs and upstate, giving down-ticket Republicans in contested state races the hope in maintaining control of the state senate. Trump leads 48 percent to 41 percent for Clinton in the suburbs and 43 percent to 41 percent in upstate New York.Trump has a slight lead with men, 43 to 40 percent and whites 45 to 42 percent.

Whether it goes higher than the Secretary of State to the President, I don't know.Hunt added that the rules of engagement specific to each country or military situation are drawn up by State Department lawyers and approved by the chain of command. ""There should be a document with Hillary's signature and the Secretary of Defense's specific to Libya. It was signed after Khadafi fell from power. You'll have to ask the State Department to get the document. They might claim it's classified, but it shouldn't be.""The State Department has rules of engagement documents that are different for different countries. In our embassies in London and Paris, for instance, it's always a mystery if the Marines at the embassies have ammunition in their weapons.Breitbart has periodically inquired with the State Department about the status of FOIA request F-2012-36006. Breitbart News made the most recent request on Monday, asking the State Department to complete its response to the FOIA request by Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 5:00 pm eastern.""It is important for the public to learn the content of this requested document prior to the 2016 presidential election held next week on November 8 because it will provide information concerning the national security record of one of the candidates, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,"" Breitbart News said in the email.""If the State Department fails to complete its response to FOIA request F-2012-36006 by Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 5:00 pm eastern, please explain why this failure is not an effort to conceal this important information from the American people prior to the presidential election,"" the email concluded.As of Thursday, the State Department has not responded.For more than four years, Breitbart News has reported on several unanswered questions related to the September 11, 2012 attack on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya. In addition to withholding the missing ""State Department Rules of Engagement for Libya"" document, the State Department has never adequately explained why Marines were not posted to guard the American embassy in Tripoli, the consulate in Benghazi, or anywhere in the entire country of Libya.On September 14, 2012, Marine Corps spokesman Captain Kendra Mott told Breitbart News that ""regarding no Marines at the embassy/consulate in Libya: Embassy security in Tripoli and the consulate in Benghazi fall under the Regional Security Officer with the State Department.""The embassy in Tripoli and the consulate in Benghazi do not have a MCESG detachment. Typically, when a new embassy is established, it takes time to grow a new MCESG detachment. In coordination with the State Department, there was discussion about establishing a detachment in Tripoli sometime in the next five years.""Regarding ROE [Rules of Engagement]: The Marine Corps does not establish ROE for MCESG detachments or other embassy security forces; that is the responsibility of the State Department and/or operational commanders depending on the command relationship. Regardless, ROE are classified and release of that information would jeopardize the Marines and U.S. interests. Any further inquiry should be directed to the State Department, since Marine security guards report to the ambassador not to a military commander,"" Motz added.The four years of stonewalling by the State Department on Breitbart's FOIA request may be an additional indication that senior executives in the federal department are trying to aid Clinton's election, consistent with new information reported by the Associated Press on Tuesday that ""A State Department official appeared to coordinate with Hillary Clinton's campaign team hours before the former secretary of state's exclusive use of private emails was first detailed in a news account last year, newly released hacked emails show."":Emails from the files of Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta show that the department official provided Clinton aides with the agency's official response to a New York Times reporter in advance of the newspaper's March 2015 report that Clinton had used a private email account to conduct all of her work-related business as secretary.The stolen emails were released Wednesday by WikiLeaks, part of a massive trove of emails released by the document-leaking group on a daily basis since last month. WikiLeaks has indicated it intends to leak emails stolen from Podesta's account every day through the election.In a March 1, 2015 email, State Department press aide Lauren Hickey told Clinton's team that then-State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki had ""just cleared"" a reply to the Times. Hickey provided the agency's response to the Clinton aides and also appeared to agree to a change requested by the campaign, saying: ""Yes on your point re records - done below."" It is not clear what specific change was requested and made.State Department spokesman John Kirby said Wednesday that the department would not comment on alleged leaked documents. But he said the department's effort to ""provide accurate information to the media"" about Clinton's tenure at the agency has ""at times required communicating with her representatives to ensure accuracy.""On December 19, 2012, in a story titled ""Benghazi Review Board Ignores Hillary's 'Rules of Engagement' for Libya,"" Breitbart News reported:The special State Department report on Benghazi (known as the Accountability Review Board) released on Tuesday offered a blistering critique of mid-level State Department officials but left Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama relatively unscathed.The report contains no mention of the State Department Rules of Engagement for Libya believed to have been signed off on by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton some time in 2011. These restrictive rules prohibited the stationing of Marines anywhere in Libya for the purpose of defending American diplomatic facilities, and set the untenable ""no bullets for local guards"" security policy that contributed to the weak Benghazi defenses prior to the attack on September 11, 2012.As Breitbart News reported in September 2013, ""A staff report prepared for Rep. Darrell Issa and released today finds numerous failings in the ARB report on Benghazi released last year. The new report overturns some of the conclusions of the official ARB report. It finds that Under Secretary of State Patrick Kennedy, who was not criticized in the ARB report, should have been held accountable.Kennedy has figured prominently in recent Wikileaks email releases.As Breitbart News reported in October, Kennedy was one of several ""high-ranking officials under Secretary of State Hillary Clinton [who] repeatedly pressured the FBI to mark certain Clinton emails as 'unclassified' in order to protect her interests, according to an unnamed FBI agent interviewed during the probe into Clinton's unauthorized use of private computer services.""Several Republicans have called on Kennedy to resign over the details of what some called a ""quid-pro-quo"" arrangement.Hunt told Breitbart News that the new State Department Rules of Engagement for Libya, approved and signed by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton since the 2011 fall of Khadafi's regime, severely compromised the safety and security of murdered Ambassador Stevens and all American diplomatic staff in Libya.
He also stated that the decision not to staff Benghazi with Marines was made by Secretary of State Clinton when she attached her signature to the State Department Rules of Engagement for Libya document. Breitbart News has subsequently learned that under those rules of engagement, Secretary Clinton prohibited Marines from providing security at any American diplomatic installation in Libya.var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([""embed""]);The Department of State Security are the people in charge of diplomatic security.

The Leader has neither cheered nor jeered the New York City developer in recent months.""If America votes like Kentucky, we'll be fine,"" he said.McConnell's shyness about Trump was widely seen on Capitol Hill as an acknowledgement of splits inside his party's caucus.McConnell's endorsement of Trump comes one day after he was trolled by USA Today.

(Bin Laden) was famous by his name, and he made a show of his piety and low-key demeanor,"" Skinner said.""Baghdadi seriously worked behind the scenes and then exploded into publicity when he was announced as the leader, but even then he didn't do publicity stunts,"" he said.""He avoids the spotlight, and when he releases a speech, it is about the caliphate and its enemies, not himself.""SIGN UP"

But none of them can eclipse the centrality of human life, especially innocent human life in the womb or at the end of life,"" he said. ""Above all and over all, the number one issue more fundamental and crucial than any other is abortion - that is the direct taking of innocent life.""Tim Kaine has regularly paraded his Catholic credentials when stumping before groups, calling himself a devout Catholic who benefited from a Jesuit education and spent time working as a missionary in Honduras.Meanwhile, a number of important U.S. Catholic prelates have sharply criticized Kaine, accusing him of ""inventing the content of his faith"" and pushing positions ""contrary to well-established Catholic teachings.""One senior Archbishop urged voters to ""be wary"" of Kaine, calling him a ""cafeteria Catholic"" who picks and chooses from Church teaching according to its political expediency. Kaine, the Archbishop said, uses ""contorted reasoning"" to go on supporting abortion while pretending to be against it.Kaine himself understands well the importance of Catholic voters come election day.""The Catholic vote is going to be absolutely critical to our success,"" Kaine said recently, encouraging volunteers to rally their fellow Catholics around the Clinton campaign.Though hardly a monolithic voting bloc, Catholics account for more than 50 million potential American voters, and the ""Catholic vote"" is crucial for anyone wishing to set up shop in the White House.The next president along with his or her administration will have a sizable impact on the future of abortion in the U.S. through his or her nominees to the U.S. Supreme Court and a number of other policies.For a number of Catholic bishops, the issue seems important enough to issue a wake-up call to their flocks.Follow Thomas D.

I don't think we're in a position to deny anything unless it's something which is within the scope of science to deny.""The statements came out of a study carried out by Rice University concerning ""scientists' perceptions of the role celebrity scientists play in socially contentious public debates."" Though the study never mentioned Richard Dawkins by name, in their replies, 48 biologists and physicists spontaneously remarked on the escapades of the well-known evolutionary biologist, and 80 percent of their comments were negative.Findings show that Dawkins' critics, ""who include both religious and nonreligious scientists,"" argue that ""Dawkins misrepresents science and scientists and reject his approach to public engagement,"" the study noted.""Scientists emphasize promotion of science over the scientist, diplomacy over derision, and dialogue over ideological extremism,"" it continued.Many of the scientists seemed to take issue with Dawkins' misunderstanding of the boundaries of science and its inherent inability to answer questions beyond its scope, a criticism that has often been leveled against the atheist author.The natural sciences do not equip their practitioners to answer questions of meaning, and nor do they ask--let alone answer--questions about ultimate realities. It is outside the scope and methodology of the sciences to do so.One of the scientists declared that Dawkins, who often wades into philosophical and theological questions, ""takes the evidence way beyond that which other scientists would regard as possible ... I think it's necessary to understand what science does address directly.""Of the British scientists interviewed, 48 of them mentioned Richard Dawkins without prompting, and nearly 80 percent (38 people) said that he conveys ""the wrong impression about the borders of scientific inquiry.""This wasn't the first time that Dawkins' prejudice against religious belief has gotten him into trouble.A year ago, Dawkins expressed his befuddlement at how the United States can simultaneously be the world leader in the natural sciences while also a strikingly religious nation.In a video posted on the Business Insider, Dawkins said that America represents ""a curious paradox"" for him, because while ""beyond any doubt it's the world's leading scientific power,"" it somehow hasn't sloughed off its religious spirit and still clings to a fundamentally biblical worldview.""What's remarkable is that America is the leading scientific nation despite being held back by this incubus, this burden of ignorance and superstition,"" Dawkins said. ""If there were some way, some educational way perhaps of getting rid of that burden, I imagine that America could bound ahead even further than it already has.""Dawkins claimed it was the role of enlightened scientists like himself to help Americans break free from the shackles of religious belief.""So the answer, I think, is education and the responsibility is on scientists like me to go out and explain to people the wonderful things about science which we now know and which so many children are shielded from by educational ignorance.""Follow Thomas D.

""These students need support and encouragement, and the schools that go out of their way to offer programs, housing, scholarships, and child care to these students should be commended.""A 2014 Guttmacher Institute study found that 42 percent of abortions are performed on women between the ages of 18 and 24, typically the college years. The two most common reasons for these women to have an abortion are: having a baby would dramatically change their lives and have an impact on their ability to continue their education, and not being able to afford a baby.SFLA uses the following criteria to determine its list of top schools that offer support for pregnant and parenting students:The following schools met these criteria for 2016:University of Washington, Seattle, Washington; Los Angeles Valley College, Los Angeles, California; Winona State University, Winona, Minnesota; University of California, San Diego, California; University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah; Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon; University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin; University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico; Texas A & M University, College Station, Texas; City College of San Francisco, San Francisco, California; Norwalk Community College, Norwalk, Connecticut; and University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Massachusetts.""Instead of sending pregnant students to the nearest Planned Parenthood, these schools have put a premium on offering pregnant and parenting students the resources they need so they don't have to choose between the life of their child and their education,"" Hawkins observes.Other resources for pregnant and parenting students - including housing options and sources for material and financial aid - are located at www.PregnantonCampus.org, an SFLA site coordinated by Beth Rahal.Planned Parenthood has planted itself on most public college and university campuses, and even has infiltrated some Catholic colleges. In an effort to shore up support for its primary service and normalize the procedure, the abortion business has encouraged college students to share their ""abortion stories.""At many colleges and universities, Planned Parenthood also joins with their student chapters to host events such as ""Sex Week,"" during which college students are taught about sexual pleasure, birth control and abortion, HIV/STD testing, and how to engage in political activism for ""reproductive justice.""Recently, Planned Parenthood has gained entrance to some high schools as well, encouraging students to form ""clubs"" that promote the goals of the abortion giant.Hawkins, however, says the colleges and universities who extend themselves to young women who want to be both a parent and a student deserve praise.""We hope that these universities will set the standard when it comes to an attitude of making campus a pregnant and parenting friendly place,"" Hawkins says.

His sources added, as he said, ""There is a lot of evidence.""""And barring some obstruction in some way, they believe they'll continue to likely an indictment,"" Baier said.Baier made the bombshell announcement in an appearance with his fellow anchor on Brit Hume's program On The Record, after earlier on his own program breaking the news that the FBI was indeed investigating the Clinton Foundation and the investigation was expansive, wide-reaching, and has gone on for a year.Twin reports--from Fox's Baier and from CNN's Pamela Brown, who along with her fellow CNN Justice Department correspondent Evan Perez said she talked with a dozen sources in positions of knowledge--confirmed that the criminal investigation into the Clinton Foundation is active, ongoing, and expansive at the FBI. It has apparently been going on for a year, and politically motivated officials at the Department of Justice--controlled by Attorney General Loretta Lynch--have reportedly tried repeatedly to shut it down. But according to another bombshell report from the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday night, FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe would not shut it down, calling it a ""validly predicated investigation"" in conversations with DOJ officials.Jason Miller, senior communications adviser to GOP presidential nominee Donald J. Trump's campaign, issued a blistering a statement in response to the news:Today's reports that the FBI has an open investigation into the Clinton Foundation shows the true extent of the corrupt Clinton cash machine. Even more concerning than that is the fact that the Obama Department of Justice is refusing to allow an overt investigation until after the election. Not only is it completely disqualifying for a candidate for president to be facing two separate FBI investigations less than a week before the election, but the fact that the Obama Administration is so blatantly trying to tip the scales of justice toward Clinton should give every American pause.A Clinton campaign spokesman has not responded to a Breitbart News request for comment in response to Baier's report of a likely indictment looming after the election.The FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation is separate from, but running parallel to, the now reopened criminal investigation into Clinton's illicit home-brew email server that she set up in violation of State Department guidelines.Today's reports that the FBI has an open investigation into the Clinton Foundation shows the true extent of the corrupt Clinton cash machine.

Trump, at 49.13 percent, leads Clinton at 44.16 percent. Libertarian Gary Johnson gets 3.59 percent and the Green Party's Dr. Jill Stein gets 0.49 percent, while 2.63 percent are undecided. The survey was conducted from Oct. 27 through Nov. 1, with a sample size of 1,154 likely voters. That means the poll was partially conducted before FBI director James Comey announced he was reopening the criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton's email scandal.Pollster Robert Cahaly, TFG's senior strategist, said that he thinks there is a Brexit-like undercurrent of Trump support in key battleground states.""It's our belief that there is a significant 'Brexit' type undercurrent of support for Trump that many polls are not capturing,"" Cahaly said. ""We have been asking a second ballot test question to measure who survey takers believe most their neighbors will vote for. In our Ohio, Florida, and this North Carolina survey we find a consistent pattern of Clinton support dropping 5-6% while Trump support increases 4.5-5.5% for this question.""""We believe the most accurate measure of support for each candidate is somewhere between how people answer for themselves and answer on behalf of their neighbors,"" Cahaly added.""Lastly we have noted that there will likely be a major influx of participation from registered voters who haven't voted since 2006 or before,"" Cahaly also said. ""This mobilization is reminiscent to the Obama turnout of 2008. These voters' primary motivation is the rejection of the establishment, just as the Obama '08 voters who rejected the establishment of that time.""Trump does even better than the original numbers when respondents are asked whom they think their neighbor supports. In that question, Trump gets 54 percent even--and Clinton drops to just 39.88 percent.This is the second survey in as many days that has shown Trump breaking through in North Carolina into the lead. The WRAL/SurveyUSA poll out on Tuesday showed Trump over 50 percent for the first time in North Carolina, leading Clinton by seven points--well outside the margin of error. That survey had Trump up 51 percent to Clinton's 44 percent.This all comes as early voting numbers suggest that Clinton is in serious trouble in the Tar Heel state, as the black community is not coming out to vote for her like they did for President Barack Obama in 2012 and 2008. Republican Mitt Romney won North Carolina in 2012, but even Obama is admitting now that black turnout in the state is way down. Obama is making two trips to North Carolina for Clinton in the final week of the campaign, and the Clinton campaign has strategically made the state its Waterloo as it's bringing out the heaviest firepower it has there.North Carolina has 15 electoral votes, and if Trump can lock those in, along with Florida's 29 electoral votes--as well as the states he already seems to have in Nevada, Ohio, and Iowa--he will be, along with the red states, at around 265 electoral votes, just shy of the 270 mark. Trump is trending upward in polls in Michigan, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Wisconsin and more in the final hours of a tumultuous campaign as Clinton finds herself under dueling FBI investigations. The FBI has reopened the criminal investigation into Clinton's illicit home-brew email server she set up in violation of State Department guidelines, and has been--as was confirmed by a bevy of reports on Wednesday evening--investigating the Clinton Foundation for over a year now.SIGN UP"

Earlier in the year, the Justice Department told the FBI essentially you don't have enough evidence here for predication to get more tools such as warrants and subpoenas. 'Go back and see what else you can dig up.' We are told that after the Clinton email probe initially wrapped up in July that those agents wanted to continue their work on the case and again DOJ said 'you don't have enough evidence here to really investigate' and so things are sort of on hold and this has sort of caused tensions to flare in the FBI and the Department of Justice. Some of those agents feel like those roadblocks are politically-driven.WATCH PAMELA BROWN'S CNN REPORT ON CLINTON FOUNDATION CORRUPTION PROBE:Similarly, over on Fox News, Special Report anchor Bret Baier dropped another bombshell on Wednesday night:Two separate sources with intimate knowledge of the FBI investigations into the Clinton emails and the Clinton Foundation tell Fox the following: The investigation into the Clinton Foundation, looking into possible pay-for-play interaction between Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Foundation has been going on for more than a year led by the White Collar Crime Division, Public Corruption Branch of the Criminal Investigative Division of the FBI. The Clinton Foundation investigation is a 'very high priority.' Agents have interviewed and re-interviewed multiple people about the Foundation case and even before the WikiLeaks dumps these sources said agents had collected a great deal of evidence. Pressed on that, one source said 'a lot of it, and there is an avalanche of new information coming in every day--some of it from WikiLeaks, some from new emails.' The agents are actively and aggressively pursuing this case and they will be going back and interviewing the same people again, some for the third time. As a result of the limited immunity deals to top aides including Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson, the Justice Department had tentatively agreed that the Justice Department would destroy those laptops after a narrow review. We are told definitively that has not happened and those devices are currently in the FBI field office here in Washington, D.C., and are being exploited. The source points out any immunity deal is null and void if any subject has lied at any point in the investigation.Baier also had new information on the investigation--a separate but parallel criminal probe--into Hillary Clinton's emails. Baier reported:Meanwhile, the classified email investigation is being run by the National Security Division of the FBI. They are currently combing through former Democratic Congressman Anthony Weiner's laptop. They have found emails they believe came from Hillary Clinton's server and that also appear to be new--as in, not duplicates. Whether they contain classified material or not is not yet known, but will likely be known soon.WATCH BRET BAIER ANNOUNCE THE BOMBSHELLS ON FOX NEWSThe Wall Street Journal on Wednesday night also broke a big story on this front.""Secret Recordings Fueled FBI Feud in Clinton Probe,"" read the headline from the Wall Street Journal's Devlin Barrett and Christopher Matthews, with a sub-headline reading: ""Agents thought they had enough material to merit aggressively pursuing investigation into Clinton Foundation.""""Secret recordings of a suspect talking about the Clinton Foundation fueled an internal battle between FBI agents who wanted to pursue the case and corruption prosecutors who viewed the statements as worthless hearsay, people familiar with the matter said,"" Barrett and Matthews wrote.In the wake of Breitbart News Editor at Large and Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer's bombshell spring 2015 book Clinton Cash, the Wall Street Journal reported that FBI agents ""using informants and recordings from unrelated corruption investigations, thought they had found enough material to merit aggressively pursuing the investigation into the foundation.""Agents wanted to pursue a more aggressive investigation, they reported, but officials at the politically tainted Department of Justice wouldn't let them. The Wall Street Journal reporters wrote:Starting in February and continuing today, investigators from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and public-corruption prosecutors became increasingly frustrated with each other, as often happens within and between departments. At the center of the tension stood the U.S. attorney for Brooklyn, Robert Capers, who some at the FBI came to view as exacerbating the problems by telling each side what it wanted to hear, these people said. Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Capers declined to comment. The roots of the dispute lie in a disagreement over the strength of the case, these people said, which broadly centered on whether Clinton Foundation contributors received favorable treatment from the State Department under Hillary Clinton. Senior officials in the Justice Department and the FBI didn't think much of the evidence, while investigators believed they had promising leads their bosses wouldn't let them pursue, they said.But more importantly, FBI agents actually presented the case to prosecutors--after which they were told by officials in the politically controlled DOJ to ""stand down."" Barrett and Matthews wrote:As 2015 came to a close, the FBI and Justice Department had a general understanding that neither side would take major action on Clinton Foundation matters without meeting and discussing it first. In February, a meeting was held in Washington among FBI officials, public-integrity prosecutors and Leslie Caldwell, the head of the Justice Department's criminal division. Prosecutors from the Eastern District of New York--Mr. Capers' office--didn't attend, these people said. The public-integrity prosecutors weren't impressed with the FBI presentation, people familiar with the discussion said. 'The message was, 'We're done here,' ' a person familiar with the matter said. Justice Department officials became increasingly frustrated that the agents seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions. Following the February meeting, officials at Justice Department headquarters sent a message to all the offices involved to 'stand down,' a person familiar with the matter said.Most damning for the Clintons, however, is the revelation that according to the Wall Street Journal report, even FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe confirmed that the FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation was a ""validly predicated investigation"" to some people at the Justice Department who tried to shut down the case.My colleague Evan Perez and I have spoken to more than a dozen officials and agents and have learned that agents in the FBI wanted to aggressively investigate the Clinton Foundation several months ago.
