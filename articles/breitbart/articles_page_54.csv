The pair was found guilty and this month were sentenced to ten years in prison for the crime, the Daily Mail reports.The strongest evidence against the pair were multiple cell phone videos taken from several angles. They show the two suspects physically assaulting the victim, who was obviously lying unresponsive on the sand.During the trial, the victim said she was unaware of what was being done to her and thought someone had drugged her drink before the assault. She also testified that she was unconscious for so long that she was not even sure she was raped; therefore, she never reported the incident.Though the victim never reported her own assault, the pair was arrested after Troy University police accidentally discovered the cell phone video while investigating an unrelated case. During the separate investigation, the video was found on a suspect's cell phone, prompting an investigation into the assault.Eventually, police tracked down cell phone video of the incident from a variety of angles taken by other people present on the scene that day.""This act was encouraged by the crowd and unbelievably by the victim's boyfriend, but there is no excuse for your actions,"" Circuit Judge James Fensom told the convicts. ""This incident was reprehensible and, on your part, a big mistake. ... It is fortunate we no longer have the Spring Break atmosphere we had in the past.""Delonte Martistee forfeited a sports scholarship in track and field as a result of his crime, and Ryan Austin Calhoun lost any chance of completing his sports management degree.But prosecutors said the convicted men showed no remorse for their actions.""There was very little remorse coming from that stand -- other than remorse that they got caught,"" prosecutor Christa Diviney said of the convicted men.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.SIGN UP"

The trip also follows meetings that Carter held with Turkish leaders on Friday, when he announced ""an agreement in principle"" for Turkey to play a role in the Mosul battle, and that friction between Turkey and Iraq can be worked out.Carter, who already has been to Iraq twice this year, has overseen the steady increase in the number of U.S. forces deployed to the fight and the growth of America's effort to train and advise Iraqi troops. In his two earlier visits, Carter announced White House decisions to increase the U.S. troop level there. There were no expectations he would do that again.Instead, he planned to meet with Iraqi leaders and military commanders to determine how the fight was going and whether any changes, increased resources or other assistance were needed.Carter's meetings in Turkey were a sign of moves to ease tensions between Turkey and Iraq over Turkish military operations in northern Iraq. That divide has grown as the operation to retake Mosul began to take shape.Some 500 Turkish troops at a base north of Mosul have been training Sunni and Kurdish fighters since last December. The Iraqi government says the troops are there without permission and has called on them to withdraw. Turkey has refused, and insists it will play a role in liberating the city.The U.S. service member killed this week was the fourth U.S. combat death in Iraq since the U.S. began military operations against IS in August 2014. It was the first since the Mosul operation began, and the service member was working with Iraqi special forces northeast of Mosul and serving as an explosive ordnance disposal specialist.U.S. military officials said a fire at a sulfur plant in northern Iraq set by IS on Thursday was creating a potential breathing hazard for American forces and other troops at a logistical base south of Mosul.Two officials said that while the fire was set two days ago in Mishraq, the winds shifted Saturday, sending the smoke south toward Qayara West air field. The base is being used by troops as a staging area for the Mosul operation. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.They said troops at the base were wearing protective masks, and that air samples were sent to the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency for analysis. Officials estimated it could take two to three days to put the fire out.U.S. defense and military officials have said that while the offensive has started well, they expect the complex fight for the city to get more difficult. They said they will be watching to see how aggressively the militants fight and whether more leaders flee the city.In what officials thought was an attempted diversion from the Mosul fight, IS attacked targets in and around the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk on Friday in a coordinated assault that killed at least 14 people.Carter was expected to meet with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi as well as other top officials.A U.S. military officer said IS had set up a multilayered defense in and around Mosul. The outer rings of this defense are what the U.S. military calls disruption zones, where IS fighters are expected to counter the Iraqi advance through the use of mortars and rockets, suicide bombers, road obstacles and car bombs.The official said the U.S. does not expect this to include high-intensity force-on-force combat in these outer rings. The expected IS focus will be on disrupting and delaying the Iraqi advance rather than trying to hold ground outside the city. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.The U.S. estimates there are between 3,000 and 5,000 IS fighters in the Mosul area, but some leaders probably have fled. A key factor will be how long those midlevel commanders stay or whether they decide to leave.The U.S. is uncertain how hard IS will defend Mosul. But once the fighting gets to the center of the city, IS will have certain advantages that are more favorable for the use of snipers and the restriction of vehicle movement.More than 4,800 U.S. troops are in Iraq and there are more than 100 U.S. special operations forces operating with Iraqi units. Hundreds more U.S. forces are playing a support role in staging bases farther from the front lines.SIGN UP"

Trump is winning among men by 5 percent. He also leads among white voters by 5 percent.Both candidates have solidified their base party vote with 78 percent of all Democrats voting for Clinton and 77 percent of Republicans voting for Trump. Independent voters favor Trump over Clinton by 7 percent. Neither candidate is attracting members of the opposite party as only 4 percent of Republicans are voting for Clinton and 5 percent of Democrats are voting for Trump.Geographically, Clinton's strongest support comes from the Detroit metropolitan area where she leads Trump 46 percent to 34 percent.

It Has Happened and Could Happen Again	"It is well accepted by historians and biographers that Richard Nixon had ample ground for contesting the 1960 election results because of widespread vote fraud in Cook County, Illinois and several counties in Lyndon Johnson's home state of Texas.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERNixon chose to not challenge the election-but not because of lack of evidence. He let it go because he feared it would tear the country apart. Well, that was then and this is now.Barack Obama and his ""transformative politics"" have already torn the country apart. In 1960, turning the country over to John Kennedy was not selling America into socialist slavery and globalist cronyism. In 2016, the alternatives are starkly different.Should anyone be surprised that Donald Trump will not allow Hillary Clinton's army of fraudsters steal an election without a fight?There are many different ways to steal an election. In the Jim Crow South, blacks were simply kept off the voter rolls by a combination of laws, threats and  intimidation. In the big cities of the North and Midwest in the 19th century, votes were simply bought and paid for by political machines. The guarantee of a secret ballot is not found in the original US Constitution; it developed a century later as one answer to the practice of vote-buying.The Pew Center just last week published a report claiming there are 1.8 million dead people on the voter rolls, and another credible report puts the total of dead people and ineligible voters at more than 4 million. The question that arises from such startling information is a simple one. If our super-smart election officials have allowed such problems to accumulate for decades without fixing them- while all the time opposing a photo ID requirement for voting --  why should citizens have confidence they can weed out all the bogus votes from the honest ones on election day?There are other, more sophisticated forms of election fraud besides counting votes cast by dead people. One of the most insidious and morally repugnant is being used in 2016 by the Democratic party's propaganda arm, the American mass media: vote suppression. The media are telling millions of Americans over and over, day in and day out, they need not bother to vote because Hillary Clinton has already won the election.That is what Donald Trump means by a ""rigged election.""When only one possible outcome is considered legitimate because the challenger has been labeled by the unified voices of the established institutions as illegitimate, can it be called a fair election? When tens of millions of voters are derided, insulted and delegitimized  as racists, ""deplorables,""  rednecks,"" ""gun nuts,"" and islamophobes -- not only by the establishment's anointed candidate herself but by her surrogates in entertainment, education and business, it is fair to ask, where is the level playing field?Meanwhile, back in Chicago, some of the old tricks are still in fashion, like voting machines that count ballots a particular way. In 2014, some voters at the Schaumburg Public Library saw touch-screen voting machines that counted votes as Democrat even if you voted for a Republican candidate. The local election official attributed the problem to a ""calibration error."" The funny thing is, there were no machines found that miscount votes the other direction.Across the nation, literally tens of millions of ballots are already in the mail and will be returned by mail, with the only security tool being signature verification. That verification is by an election judge who is given an average of three seconds to compare the signature accompanying the ballot to the one in an electronic record.In Billings, Montana, police are investigating reports of ballots being stolen from apartment mail boxes. In thousands of apartment buildings and nursing homes, millions of mailed ballots await pick-up by their owners- or by a  ballot harvester who will gladly vote the ballot or offer assistance in filling out the ballot and then delivering it to a polling place.Is widespread vote fraud built into all-mail balloting? Is speed of counting more important to election officials than accuracy? Can you spell, willful blindness?Donald Trump has said he will accept a ""clear outcome"" but reserves the right to challenge vote fraud. Yet, he is still being slandered for even raising the possibility of a rigged election. Let me suggest a different outcome will yield a different set  of heroes and villains.What if Trump gets to 270 Electoral College votes by carrying key Electoral College swing states including Florida, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Iowa, and Ohio. What if he repeats the Bush victory of 2000 by winning the Electoral College but loses the popular vote because of losing populous states like California and New York by wide margins? Will the progressives accept the election results as valid under our Constitution, or will there be massive riots and disruptions?The 2016 election has been full of surprises from the beginning, and there may be on more surprise in store. It's not really news that the establishment has attempted to rig the election against Trump from the beginning- both the media establishment and the Republican establishment. Yet, he has not only survived, he remains within three to five points of a majority vote in the dozen key states he needs for victory.That's why vote suppression is now the name of the game. For 16 months Trump has been dismissed as a hopeless loser. The truth is, three percentage points in any presidential poll is within the margin of error.   If every Trump enthusiast votes and those millions of votes are stacked up against the votes cast by a handful of Clinton enthusiasts, Trump will win.Of course, we may still have to deal with a few thousand pesky voting machines that seem to have a mind of their own.SIGN UP"

But instead of complaints about unfair loan terms or strong-arm tactics, 98 percent of the customers praised small-dollar lending.The agency received only 240 so-called negative responses, and 84 of them dealt with complaints about other industries and were misclassified and 42 dealt with complaints directed at payday lending scams, which are perpetrated by unregulated lenders unaffected by the rule.Borrowers said small-dollar lenders were everything traditional banks were not. They were straightforward, convenient, easy to use, with understandable processes and fair prices. They kept people off welfare and allowed them to buy Christmas presents for their children, fix their cars and pay their utility bills.The bureau hid the results - it took a Freedom of Information Act request from the Community Financial Services Association of America to dislodge them - because they wanted to promulgate a far tougher regulation than the industry's customers would want.And now it appears the rule the bureau did propose was not tough enough for some people. Last week, attorneys general from seven states and the District of Columbia urged the bureau to strengthen the regulation because those states have passed laws that effectively banished consumer lending, and they don't want to see it come back.The rule, proposed in June and set to take effect 15 months after it is finalized probably early next year, does not limit interest rates on consumer loans because the bureau is not allowed to. Rather, it requires lenders to ensure their customers are able to repay before they can make loans. In some cases, the reporting requirements would make it easier to get a credit card with a $10,000 limit than to borrow $100 online or from a storefront consumer lender.Under the rule, which received more than 1 million comments - by far the most in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's five years of rulemaking - lenders must conduct a full-fledged analysis of their customers' finances, regardless of the loan amount. They must determine not only if borrowers can repay, but whether they then will have enough money to pay all their bills and normal living expenses afterward. Borrowers would have to submit a written statement of their income, housing expenses, outstanding debt and child support, as well as obtain a national credit report.Most lenders say they cannot profitably offer their services if this goes through.Various states, mostly on the East Coast, thought they already had eliminated consumer lenders when they passed laws that limit loan rates so severely lenders cannot make a profit.But the attorneys general from those states, which included Pennsylvania and New York, told the agency they worry the rule doesn't sufficiently acknowledge their prerogative to limit rates, and they worry putting the emphasis on ability to repay will allow lenders to move back in. They worry about the provision that allows lenders to extend six loans per year to each individual before the ability-to-repay requirement kicks in.It's not just ""Do you still beat your wife?"" but ""Do you still beat your wife enough?""The attorneys generals' letter came on the last day of the comment period, and it's unclear what the agency is prepared to do to address its concerns.But the fact is there's no fixing the Small-Dollar Lending Rule. Not when the workforce participation rate is 62.9 percent. Not when a two-term president will leave office next January after becoming the first president in American history never to have presided over even 3 percent growth. Not when the people hurt most will be the people who have the least.People making $200,000 per year don't take out many consumer loans. It's the $40,000-and-less crowd, those recently separated from their spouses and, disproportionately the disabled. African-Americans, those with less than a college degree and renters also are frequent customers.States brag that when they cut out consumer lending, barely 1 in 20 customers turn to alternatives such as online lending. Instead, they borrow from friends and family, get a loan from a bank or credit union, pawn or sell possessions or delay paying some bills. None of those alternatives are any more virtuous or any more effective at putting customers on sound financial ground than consumer loans.Then there's the basic issue of being judgmental. What difference does it make why people take out loans, how many they take out per year or even whether some get caught in a debt trap? Would borrowing from a bank, delaying payment of bills or letting checks bounce be more favorable financially or in terms of credit?The fact here is there are customers and companies standing in line to do business with each other. The companies offer a service customers need, and the repayment rates - 90 percent for most loans - make it profitable for the companies as well.Don't fix the rule; ditch it. Nobody who needs the loans will be upset, and the people who will be upset never will need these loans or understand why other decent Americans do.SIGN UP"

She said her daughter will accept full responsibility for her actions.The man is recovering from a bruised eye he suffered during the attack.The video has been viewed more than a million times, its reach going so wide across the Internet that the victim's relatives from Ireland contacted him to say they saw the video.SIGN UP

The victim had a breakdown on the witness stand and was sent to a mental hospital but the DA jailed her after she was released.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAn ad featuring the rape victim's mother has hit local televisions and the Internet. The mother is visually silhouetted so you cannot see her face.The DA was already under-fire with her GOP political base after she indicted the Planned Parenthood video undercover journalists, and did not indict a doctor accused of performing illegal late-term abortions. A criminal court judge later dismissed the charges against the Planned Parenthood videographers David Daleiden and Susan (Sandra) Merritt.Breitbart News reported that then-Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst demanded an investigation of Dr. Douglas Karpen in 2013 after a video expose revealed horrific facts about the abortions. The article includes a graphic video and statements by three of his employees. They alleged that after babies were birthed alive, Karpen would cut their spinal cord, stab the baby's soft spot to kill it, or twist the head off the neck with his bare hands.In the ad featuring the rape victim's mother, she tells viewers, ""My daughter Jenny, was a victim of rape. Testifying in court, she broke down. She was hurting, she needed compassion, but she was handcuffed, and put in the back of a police car. And District Attorney Devon Anderson's Office had her sent to jail. - The same jail as her attacker, for 27 days, and Jenny was brutalized there. I'd like to tell Devon Anderson - Jail is for rapists and other violent criminals. It's no place for innocent victims like my daughter.""""They didn't care,"" Jenny ""was collateral damage, and someone wanted to further their career, and that's all it was,"" Jenny's mother told Pulitzer Prize winning columnist Lisa Falkenberg of the Houston Chronicle. Falkenberg received the award in 2015 for her series on ""a corrupt and abusive grand jury system.""The frantic mother begged Anderson's office to get Jenny out of jail, but her daughter was released only after Sheriff Ron Hickman acted, the Chronicle reported. The mother, who is referred to as ""Barbara"" in order to protect her daughter, a sexual assault victim, was reported to say that Hickman released her ""within hours of learning of the victim's plight.""Jenny was placed with the general population and was in jail for 27 days over the Christmas holidays. As reported by Click2Houston, some of the jail staff thought Jenny was a sexual assault defendant rather than a victim. The jail attaches the alleged rapist's offense to the victim's inmate's electronic record.Anderson's opponent in the November election, Kim Ogg noted, ""Putting a witness in jail - highly irregular."" Ogg is hitting Anderson with YouTube video ads and television spots. The manner in which the District Attorney responded has also been an issue.To respond to the controversy, Anderson put her videotaped statement on YouTube and on her Facebook page. In the video she asks -- ""How were we to assume that a homeless, mentally ill victim of an aggravated sex assault, would return to testify at the trial of her rapist when that victim was going through a life-threatening mental health crisis and had expressed her intention not to testify?"" The victim's lawyer charges that the DA was being dishonest and his client was not homeless. He says the DA's investigators picked Jenny up at her apartment to bring her to Houston to testify so they know she was not homeless.Moreover, the local NBC affiliate reported that they asked Anderson ""how many times a witness has been placed in jail to assure the witness will be available to testify.""  The DA originally distributed a written statement that said ""Witness bonds are a common tool used by prosecutors and defense attorneys."" They reported that just one day later the DA said in her video, ""We rarely do this, but when a case calls for it to be done we are willing to make that hard decision.""The Houston DA is under fire not only for jailing a rape victim, she is in trouble with her political base over indicting the Planned Parenthood undercover journalists. Lawyers for Daleiden and  Merritt, one of them a former Harris County Republican Party chairman, charged ""We have clear evidence that the DA is colluding with Planned Parenthood,"" as reported by Breitbart Texas.Jared Woodfill explained, ""The lawyer for Planned Parenthood worked with the DA to indict, and he knew that the grand jury never voted on whether to indict Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast in Houston, something that is supposed to be confidential."" Woodfill and Daleiden's other lawyer, Terry Yates, said the Planned Parenthood lawyer has spoken about these issues to the press. Woodfill called it ""A public-speaking tour.""Woodfill told Breitbart Texas, ""You would expect this in New York and California but not in Houston, Texas."" The Houston-based lawyer and defense co-counsel Yates are astounded that a pro-life ""whistleblower"" could be indicted.As reported by Breitbart Texas in mid-April, Daleiden's lawyers filed motions to quash his indictments urging that the Planned Parenthood lawyer, Josh Schaffer, boasted during a press conference that prosecutors maintained a ""dialogue"" with him ""throughout"" the grand jury proceedings and told him that the grand jury's focus later ""shifted"" to Daleiden. Schaffer admits in his affidavit that he told the prosecutor that he believed Daleiden and Merritt had broken the law for felony tampering with a government document, and that Daleiden had committed a crime by offering to buy fetal tissue. Daleiden's lawyers also urged that Schaffer boasted that the grand jury never even took a vote on whether or not to indict Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, nor did they call a single witness from PPGC before the grand jury.Daleiden's lawyers also urged that the District Attorney did not follow the law when she told Planned Parenthood and National Abortion Federation lawyers that Daleiden and Merritt had been indicted by a grand jury. The move by the DA to tell abortion mill lawyers of the indictments at that point has been called by defense lawyers ""an unusual move.""The indictments of David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt by a Harris County grand jury surprised pro-life advocates who were expecting that an investigation of Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast would result in criminal action against Planned Parenthood executives for selling baby body parts.Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast is a mega-abortion facility located in Houston and was one of the facilities stung by the undercover videos produced by Daleiden and Merritt, reported Breitbart News. Daleiden is the president and founder of the Center for Medical Progress (CMP).Both Daleiden and Merritt are well-known for the series of undercover videos with Planned Parenthood executives and employees. A research director at Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast in Houston was the subject of one of these videos. Breitbart News reported on August 4, 2015 that ""A video just released by the Center for Medical Progress taken undercover in Texas shows a Planned Parenthood research director discussing the sale of whole intact aborted babies to a company that resells them to medical researchers.As a result of the investigation, there have been no indictments involving Planned Parenthood, including from the Office of the Harris County District Attorney; rather, Daleiden and Merritt were indicted for felony tampering of a government record (false driver licenses). Daleiden was also indicted for the misdemeanor charge of offering to buy fetal tissue. The offering to buy fetal tissue charge against Daleiden was dismissed by a criminal judge in June who found that the court did not have jurisdiction, as reported by Breitbart Texas. Although she could do so after the election, the DA has not tried to return to the grand jury to seek a reindictment.The remaining felony charges for the alleged use of fake driver licenses against the Planned Parenthood videographers were dismissed in late July, as reported by Breitbart Texas. The State filed a motion to dismiss the felony charge noting that a ""colorable claim [was] raised [by defense counsel] regarding whether [the] grand jury investigated new matters after [the] extension order was issued."" A grand jury's term may be extended by court order but not for new matters to be considered. A grand jury's term may be extended only for matters already before it. Judge Brock Thomas, Anderson's former criminal defense law partner, signed an order dismissing the charges.After the dismissal, a spokesperson for Daleiden released the following statement:""The dismissal of the bogus, politically motivated charges against CMP project lead David Daleiden and investigator Sandra Merritt is a resounding vindication of the First Amendment rights of all citizen journalists, and also a clear warning to any of Planned Parenthood's political cronies who would attack whistleblowers to protect Planned Parenthood from scrutiny. Planned Parenthood tried to collude with public officials to manipulate the legal process to their own benefit, and they failed. A year after the release of the undercover videos, the ongoing nationwide investigation of Planned Parenthood by the House Select Investigative Panel makes clear that Planned Parenthood is the guilty party in the harvesting and trafficking of baby body parts for profit.""The political fallout for Anderson - a new poll from the University of Houston shows that the Republican candidate for DA is down seven points to her opponent in the race.Breitbart Texas' Bob Price reported on Wednesday that the poll that has Republican DA Anderson down seven points, has Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump leading by three-points over Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton. The poll was conducted using a four-way race. He reported that the poll of 1,000 voters who responded they were ""certain to vote"" (77 percent), or ""very likely to vote"" (23 percent), gave Trump a three-point lead over Clinton (41-38 percent). There is a +/- three percent margin of error in the poll. The polling organization said it weighted the sample to ""reflect the racial and ethnic composition of the electorate based on the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections."" Among those saying they were ""certain to vote,"" Trump leads by a four-point margin (42-39). The race is a dead heat among those claiming to be ""very likely to vote.""Anderson's Democrat opponent 56-year-old Kim Ogg, was a former chief felony prosecutor before she was tapped to lead the City of Houston's Anti-Gang Task Force. She also served as the executive director of Crime Stoppers from 1999 to 2006 where she says she helped capture thousands of violent felons. She also says there was a 40 percent reduction in gang violence when she headed the City's anti-gang organization. Ogg ran for a criminal district court bench as a Republican in a four-person race in the 1990's.Anderson, a former prosecutor, criminal court judge, and criminal defense attorney, became the district attorney in Harris County after her husband, DA Mike Anderson passed away from cancer in 2013.Although the Houston Chronicle generally leans towards incumbents, the editorial board endorsed Ogg. Their editorial begins with, ""Why should Kim Ogg replace Devon Anderson as district attorney? Let us count the ways."" In addition to the jailing of a sexual assault victim, the DA's hometown publication listed, among other things, that she: ""unnecessarily delayed the case of Alfred Dewayne Brown after the appeals court overturned his conviction, leaving an innocent man in jail for months. She mishandled the prosecution of anti-abortion activists charged with tampering with a government record, facing criticism from both pro-choice and anti-abortion groups.""Lana Shadwick is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas. She has served as a prosecutor and associate judge in Texas. Follow her on Twitter @LanaShadwick2.""The dismissal of the bogus, politically motivated charges against CMP project lead David Daleiden and investigator Sandra Merritt is a resounding vindication of the First Amendment rights of all citizen journalists, and also a clear warning to any of Planned Parenthood's political cronies who would attack whistleblowers to protect Planned Parenthood from scrutiny.

15	http://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2016/10/22/refugee-resettlement-hot-topic-heartland/	Refugee Resettlement Is a Hot Topic in the Heartland	"Even more than the residents of urban epicenters like Los Angeles or New York, Americans in the Heartland are interested in refugee resettlement, as shown by recent events in places like Fargo, North Dakota, and Twin Falls, Idaho.Refugee Resettlement in Fargo, N.D.Two Views of Refugee ResettlementAmericans Reject Refugee ResettlementSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERRefugee resettlement rates are the subject of conversation and conflict in America's Heartland. A recent city commission meeting in Fargo showcased two different views of the refugee resettlement issue, and is representative of a wider pattern of keen public interest in the issue of refugee resettlement, something the mainstream media are largely ignoring.The reason people care about refugee resettlement in Fargo has to do largely with how many are arriving. North Dakota currently takes in more refugees per capita than any other state: ""Over roughly the past two years, no state has taken in more refugees per capita than North Dakota, a distinction the mayor of the state's largest city said should inspire pride.""Although North Dakota has not received the largest number of refugees total, in the fiscal year 2014 through this August, it has taken in almost three times as many per capita (135 per 100,000) as states like Texas (45 per 100,000), which during that period took a total of 13,000.Population-light states like North Dakota form the core of the list of the states that take in the most refugees per capita:Of the five states that accept the most refugees per capita, three are low-population states with less than 1 million residents, according to 2014 census figures: North Dakota, South Dakota and Vermont. The other two states in the top five are Nebraska and Idaho.Minnesota took in the eighth-most refugees per capita in the recent two-year period -- 77 per 100,000 residents.This influx of refugees into North Dakota is being met with demands for caution and prudence by members of the public and politicians:A Change.org petition from August calling on a moratorium on resettlements in Fargo has more than 3,000 signatures, and the petition creator, Damon Ouradnik, says he has been in contact with the offices of Rep. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., and Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D.In response to President Obama's plan to allow more refugees into the country in the next two years, Cramer announced this week he was co-sponsoring legislation that would give Congress, rather than the president, control over how many refugees enter the U.S.Cramer said ""state and local governments should be concerned"" about the financial impact of increasing the number of refugees from 70,000 to 100,000 in the next two years.""It will be taxpayers footing the bill for these refugees,"" he said in the statement. Cramer's office did not make him available for questions on Friday.Also alarming to American citizens in these states is the transmission of tuberculosis brought by refugees from other countries that have high rates of infection.From a previous article:1,710 refugees were resettled in Cass County, North Dakota, by LSSND between 2011 and 2015, more than 69 percent of the 2,459 refugees the agency resettled in the state of North Dakota and nearby Clay County, Minnesota, (which received a total of 77 refugees) during that five year period, according to LSSND.Fifty-nine percent of the refugees resettled in North Dakota and neighboring Clay County, Minnesota, by LSSND during these five years, or 1,452 out of 2,454, came from Bhutan, a country that has high rates of active TB and latent TB infection (LTBI).Thirteen percent of the refugees resettled in North Dakota and neighboring Clay County, Minnesota, by LSSND during these five years, or 316 out of 2,454, came from Somalia, another country that has high rates of active TB and LTBI....""Our findings suggest that newly arrived refugees with LTBI have a considerable burden of clinical risk factors that increase their risk for reactivation of TB, which may contribute to the increased proportion of active TB among foreign-born populations in the United States if not prioritized for LTBI treatment. Efforts to ensure adequate LTBI treatment among high-risk refugees such as those documented in this study should be a public health priority.""When Texas tested adult male Bhutanese refugees for tuberculosis, they found that 48 percent of them had LTBI (Latent TB Infection), 12 times the average rate for America.Just to the east of North Dakota, many of the refugees in Minnesota have arrived with tuberculosis, ten times more than any other state at a total of 296 refugees:During the five years between 2010 and 2014, 732 cases of active TB were diagnosed in Minnesota. Of these, 81 percent, or 593, were foreign-born. Of foreign-born cases, 50 percent, or 296, were refugees, according to ""The Epidemiology of Tuberculosis in Minnesota, 2010-2014,"" a report published by the Minnesota Department of Health.Minnesota's 81 percent of TB cases diagnosed among foreign-born residents is significantly higher than the 66 percent of TB cases in the entire country that were diagnosed among foreign-born residents in 2015.Another reason for the interest was the case of the recent terrorist stabbing attack in Saint Cloud by Dahir Adan, a Somalian refugee whose brother Abdullahi is currently jailed in Fargo. ISIS later claimed Adan's stabbing of eight people. The article states:A man who stabbed nine people at a mall in central Minnesota before being shot dead is a ""soldier of the Islamic State,"" the militant group's news agency said on Sunday, as the FBI investigated the attack as a potential act of terrorism.In St. Cloud, the attacker entered the mall in the evening as it was busy with shoppers, Anderson said. He attacked his victims at several sites in the shopping center, which will remain closed on Sunday as police investigate, the police chief said.The victims were male and female, Kleis said, and ranged in age from mid-50s to a 15-year-old girl.Dahir's brother, Abdullahi, is also currently in jail for being one of two people carrying ""various amounts of drugs and over a thousand dollars in cash"":Court records show Abdullahi Adan pleaded not guilty to two felony drug counts in July. He is being held at the Cass County Jail after being arrested for drugs back in June of this year in Fargo. During a traffic stop, an officer smelled marijuana, detained Adan and two other men, and subsequently found various amounts of drugs and over a thousand dollars in cash in the vehicle.Adan also has a pending appeal with the North Dakota Supreme Court after being arrested in the western part of the state late last year, officers again finding a large amount of marijuana.Abdullahi Adan is part of a group of inmates suing the Cass County Jail, alleging pork had been included in their meals. As the men are Muslim, their religion does not permit them to ingest pork.The recent Fargo city commission meeting gives two different and summary views of the issue. John Strand says that we should take into account the real difficulties refugees have to face, while Dave Piepkorn wants to understand the costs the county is having to pay while it chooses to take in refugees.Below is City Commissioner John Strand:STRANAHAN: So we're talking to City Commissioner John Strand. During the discussion about the refugee program today, you talked about the humanitarian obligation. Can you expand on that a little bit?STRAND: Well, I'll try. When we're dealing with refugees, we're dealing with individuals who are involuntarily displaced - it's important to understand that. We're dealing with people who have a stateless status; they don't have any government that they're part of or representing them while they're in that situation of being displaced. They're victims of U.S. policy over seas and the consequences of even our own government's actions, and they're under the authority of the U.N. high commissioner- the U.N. charter. So with that said, I don't think we all understand, and I'm learning myself, that we all understand what it means to be a refugee, nor do I believe comprehend and understand the situations from which they came and the parts of their history that are very often so painful that people can't even talk about them.So I think that's part of this picture. You know everybody here (except for Native Americans) came from immigrant families in the past. And yet, knock on wood, we weren't forced to dislocate as refugees because of the circumstances they're facing today. I think it behooves us and we're called upon to have a humanitarian compassion.STRANAHAN: And up here in far-North Dakota, you've seen interest in the community about this issue?STRAND: Well, there is an issue. It's new to us. We're rather significantly a homogeneous community that's evolving and becoming diverse through time and through circumstances of the world. And we have that unfolding in our own community, which brings to us unknowns, things we don't understand, brings to us cultures, people, religions, and backgrounds we don't quite understand. So we're all growing into this, especially the new Americans who've landed here - often without even the language skills or the cultural skills or the technology skills that they inherit when they land here. So, that's a reality. I believe any community that's dealing with growth and diversity is challenged and needs to address on how they become more inclusive, how do they become more welcoming, how do they become more understanding and accepting, how do they participate and help in fashions where we work with each other, we mentor others, we help them reach their highest potential in life in careers, in home-ownership, in education, in feeling okay about their homes and the space they occupy. I think that's a call we're all challenged with, in not just a fiscal or fiduciary way, but in a heartfelt way, in a compassionate way, where I believe sincerely, this is a test to us - how we deal with others who aren't so fortunate, and we're part of their journeys forward in life, and we have a shared journey going forward. I believe this is a test of us, as well, and to me that's a very important one.Below is City Commissioner Dave Piepkorn:PIEPKORN: I'm Dave Piepkorn, a Fargo City commissioner. What happened tonight, I was very pleased with our discussion. What we ended up deciding was, we're gonna have continued research, and what we're gonna do is look at is exactly how much money are we spending in our county on the refugees. That includes everything. That includes education, health care, transportation, housing, law enforcement, everything. So I was very pleased, and one of my cohorts supported it, as well, so I was a little surprised; he has his own agenda.STRANAHAN: Who were you talking about?PIEPKORN: John Strand. So we have a human relations commission, and so it will be directed. They're a part of it, but I'm on the finance, so that's my focus. The first step is to find out how much money we're spending. The thing that came up that was the most concerning to me was, we, as public leaders, we have had no participation in determining the people that are coming here. Basically, what L.S.S. said was they have a group...STRANAHAN: That's Lutheran Social Services, correct?PIEPKORN: Lutheran Social Services basically said they're the ones that are deciding, and to me, that's unacceptable, and so if I were to predict what's gonna happen is we are gonna be the ones setting the number of refugees that come here, and we will know how much it's gonna cost us. And the taxpayers deserve that.STRANAHAN: And so Lutheran Social Services actually gave a presentation tonight at the commission meeting, and you felt some stuff was probably missing from their presentation because they're involved.PIEPKORN: Absolutely.STRANAHAN: It was a good presentation but probably a little one-sided.PIEPKORN: And I don't blame them. They're L.S.S. It's what they do, and they did a good job, but there's several questions I didn't talk about. But for now we're moving forward and our number one focus now is ""how much is this costing the public in Fargo? How much money are we spending?"" And I think when people find out all those numbers, they're gonna be very disappointed.STRANAHAN: Well, I thought as an outsider ,I did think it was a great example of -- we got two sides of it, and you guys were completely civil, very friendly up there tonight, and trying to get to the bottom of this and having a public discussion about it. Have you noticed people in Fargo -- is this a big issue for them?PIEPKORN: Absolutely, if you get a chance, the local newspaper wrote an editorial criticizing me last Sunday, but unfortunately for them, they also ran a poll on what people thought of this, and 80 percent were in favor of what I was doing, so I think they found themselves in a bit of a tough spot because the majority of people wanna know what's going on. And so that's what we're gonna find out.STRANAHAN: Do you think there's an element of political correctness?PIEPKORN: Are you kidding me? You call yourself a journalist? (laughs)STRANAHAN: It's a softball.PIEPKORN: Of course, political correctness. And if you're not careful, political correctness is gonna get you killed.STRANAHAN: It's a softball, but it's the kind of question the media never asks because they don't want to acknowledge political correctness.PIEPKORN: Of course not. The other thing: I didn't want to attack L.S.S. because they're just an agent. The main people, the thing that I've learned in the last couple of weeks, and I've gotten advice from all over the country, my main target now is John Hoeven. He's our senator in North Dakota, he's on the appropriations committee, and he also happens to be a very good friend of mine.The backlash against refugee resettlement has roots and reasons that cannot be remedied by rhetoric alone, a fact made palpable in the form of polls showing that most Americans oppose resettling any refugees, finding that ""fifty-three percent of U.S. adults in the survey, conducted in the days immediately following the attacks, say the nation should not continue a program to resettle up to 10,000 Syrian refugees."" It continues, ""Just 28 percent would keep the program with the screening process as it now exists, while 11 percent said they would favor a limited program to accept only Syrian Christians while excluding Muslims, a proposal Obama has dismissed as 'shameful' and un-American.""Of the five states that accept the most refugees per capita, three are low-population states with less than 1 million residents, according to 2014 census figures: North Dakota, South Dakota and Vermont. The other two states in the top five are Nebraska and Idaho.
Minnesota took in the eighth-most refugees per capita in the recent two-year period -- 77 per 100,000 residents.A Change.org petition from August calling on a moratorium on resettlements in Fargo has more than 3,000 signatures, and the petition creator, Damon Ouradnik, says he has been in contact with the offices of Rep. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., and Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D.

In response to President Obama's plan to allow more refugees into the country in the next two years, Cramer announced this week he was co-sponsoring legislation that would give Congress, rather than the president, control over how many refugees enter the U.S.
Cramer said ""state and local governments should be concerned"" about the financial impact of increasing the number of refugees from 70,000 to 100,000 in the next two years.
var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([""embed""]);""It will be taxpayers footing the bill for these refugees,"" he said in the statement. Cramer's office did not make him available for questions on Friday.

1,710 refugees were resettled in Cass County, North Dakota, by LSSND between 2011 and 2015, more than 69 percent of the 2,459 refugees the agency resettled in the state of North Dakota and nearby Clay County, Minnesota, (which received a total of 77 refugees) during that five year period, according to LSSND.
Fifty-nine percent of the refugees resettled in North Dakota and neighboring Clay County, Minnesota, by LSSND during these five years, or 1,452 out of 2,454, came from Bhutan, a country that has high rates of active TB and latent TB infection (LTBI).
Thirteen percent of the refugees resettled in North Dakota and neighboring Clay County, Minnesota, by LSSND during these five years, or 316 out of 2,454, came from Somalia, another country that has high rates of active TB and LTBI.
...
""Our findings suggest that newly arrived refugees with LTBI have a considerable burden of clinical risk factors that increase their risk for reactivation of TB, which may contribute to the increased proportion of active TB among foreign-born populations in the United States if not prioritized for LTBI treatment. Efforts to ensure adequate LTBI treatment among high-risk refugees such as those documented in this study should be a public health priority.""During the five years between 2010 and 2014, 732 cases of active TB were diagnosed in Minnesota. Of these, 81 percent, or 593, were foreign-born. Of foreign-born cases, 50 percent, or 296, were refugees, according to ""The Epidemiology of Tuberculosis in Minnesota, 2010-2014,"" a report published by the Minnesota Department of Health.
Minnesota's 81 percent of TB cases diagnosed among foreign-born residents is significantly higher than the 66 percent of TB cases in the entire country that were diagnosed among foreign-born residents in 2015.A man who stabbed nine people at a mall in central Minnesota before being shot dead is a ""soldier of the Islamic State,"" the militant group's news agency said on Sunday, as the FBI investigated the attack as a potential act of terrorism.
...
In St. Cloud, the attacker entered the mall in the evening as it was busy with shoppers, Anderson said. He attacked his victims at several sites in the shopping center, which will remain closed on Sunday as police investigate, the police chief said.
The victims were male and female, Kleis said, and ranged in age from mid-50s to a 15-year-old girl.Court records show Abdullahi Adan pleaded not guilty to two felony drug counts in July. He is being held at the Cass County Jail after being arrested for drugs back in June of this year in Fargo. During a traffic stop, an officer smelled marijuana, detained Adan and two other men, and subsequently found various amounts of drugs and over a thousand dollars in cash in the vehicle.
Adan also has a pending appeal with the North Dakota Supreme Court after being arrested in the western part of the state late last year, officers again finding a large amount of marijuana.
Abdullahi Adan is part of a group of inmates suing the Cass County Jail, alleging pork had been included in their meals. As the men are Muslim, their religion does not permit them to ingest pork.STRANAHAN: So we're talking to City Commissioner John Strand. During the discussion about the refugee program today, you talked about the humanitarian obligation. Can you expand on that a little bit?
STRAND: Well, I'll try. When we're dealing with refugees, we're dealing with individuals who are involuntarily displaced - it's important to understand that. We're dealing with people who have a stateless status; they don't have any government that they're part of or representing them while they're in that situation of being displaced. They're victims of U.S. policy over seas and the consequences of even our own government's actions, and they're under the authority of the U.N. high commissioner- the U.N. charter. So with that said, I don't think we all understand, and I'm learning myself, that we all understand what it means to be a refugee, nor do I believe comprehend and understand the situations from which they came and the parts of their history that are very often so painful that people can't even talk about them.
So I think that's part of this picture. You know everybody here (except for Native Americans) came from immigrant families in the past. And yet, knock on wood, we weren't forced to dislocate as refugees because of the circumstances they're facing today. I think it behooves us and we're called upon to have a humanitarian compassion.
STRANAHAN: And up here in far-North Dakota, you've seen interest in the community about this issue?
STRAND: Well, there is an issue. It's new to us. We're rather significantly a homogeneous community that's evolving and becoming diverse through time and through circumstances of the world. And we have that unfolding in our own community, which brings to us unknowns, things we don't understand, brings to us cultures, people, religions, and backgrounds we don't quite understand. So we're all growing into this, especially the new Americans who've landed here - often without even the language skills or the cultural skills or the technology skills that they inherit when they land here. So, that's a reality. I believe any community that's dealing with growth and diversity is challenged and needs to address on how they become more inclusive, how do they become more welcoming, how do they become more understanding and accepting, how do they participate and help in fashions where we work with each other, we mentor others, we help them reach their highest potential in life in careers, in home-ownership, in education, in feeling okay about their homes and the space they occupy. I think that's a call we're all challenged with, in not just a fiscal or fiduciary way, but in a heartfelt way, in a compassionate way, where I believe sincerely, this is a test to us - how we deal with others who aren't so fortunate, and we're part of their journeys forward in life, and we have a shared journey going forward. I believe this is a test of us, as well, and to me that's a very important one.PIEPKORN: I'm Dave Piepkorn, a Fargo City commissioner. What happened tonight, I was very pleased with our discussion. What we ended up deciding was, we're gonna have continued research, and what we're gonna do is look at is exactly how much money are we spending in our county on the refugees. That includes everything. That includes education, health care, transportation, housing, law enforcement, everything. So I was very pleased, and one of my cohorts supported it, as well, so I was a little surprised; he has his own agenda.
STRANAHAN: Who were you talking about?
PIEPKORN: John Strand. So we have a human relations commission, and so it will be directed. They're a part of it, but I'm on the finance, so that's my focus. The first step is to find out how much money we're spending. The thing that came up that was the most concerning to me was, we, as public leaders, we have had no participation in determining the people that are coming here. Basically, what L.S.S. said was they have a group...
STRANAHAN: That's Lutheran Social Services, correct?
PIEPKORN: Lutheran Social Services basically said they're the ones that are deciding, and to me, that's unacceptable, and so if I were to predict what's gonna happen is we are gonna be the ones setting the number of refugees that come here, and we will know how much it's gonna cost us. And the taxpayers deserve that.
STRANAHAN: And so Lutheran Social Services actually gave a presentation tonight at the commission meeting, and you felt some stuff was probably missing from their presentation because they're involved.
PIEPKORN: Absolutely.
STRANAHAN: It was a good presentation but probably a little one-sided.
PIEPKORN: And I don't blame them. They're L.S.S. It's what they do, and they did a good job, but there's several questions I didn't talk about. But for now we're moving forward and our number one focus now is ""how much is this costing the public in Fargo? How much money are we spending?"" And I think when people find out all those numbers, they're gonna be very disappointed.
STRANAHAN: Well, I thought as an outsider ,I did think it was a great example of -- we got two sides of it, and you guys were completely civil, very friendly up there tonight, and trying to get to the bottom of this and having a public discussion about it. Have you noticed people in Fargo -- is this a big issue for them?
PIEPKORN: Absolutely, if you get a chance, the local newspaper wrote an editorial criticizing me last Sunday, but unfortunately for them, they also ran a poll on what people thought of this, and 80 percent were in favor of what I was doing, so I think they found themselves in a bit of a tough spot because the majority of people wanna know what's going on. And so that's what we're gonna find out.
STRANAHAN: Do you think there's an element of political correctness?
PIEPKORN: Are you kidding me? You call yourself a journalist? (laughs)
STRANAHAN: It's a softball.
PIEPKORN: Of course, political correctness. And if you're not careful, political correctness is gonna get you killed.
STRANAHAN: It's a softball, but it's the kind of question the media never asks because they don't want to acknowledge political correctness.
PIEPKORN: Of course not. The other thing: I didn't want to attack L.S.S. because they're just an agent.

A 2012 United Nations report found that the earth's cattle population actually produces more carbon dioxide than automobiles, planes, and all other forms of transport combined. Moreover, the cow pies they drop and the wind they break produce a third of the world's twenty-times-more-detrimental methane emissions.This past summer, EcoWatch published an article reiterating that greenhouse gas emissions from livestock actually account for a higher percentage of total global emissions than the world's 1.2 billion automobiles.And yet now, it appears that cow belching is a much bigger problem even than the occasional flatulence that was thought to be so detrimental to the environment because of the methane produced in cows' stomachs. ""Despite misconceptions, most cow methane comes from burps (90%) rather than farts (10%),"" Michael Battaglia writes in The Conversation.Moreover, livestock ""is a major global contributor to methane emissions, and methane traps 86 times more heat than carbon dioxide over a 20-year time frame,"" one learns.Happily, global warming doomsayers are not yet proposing to kill all the world's cows (though they do propose a major cutback in meat consumption). A group of Australian environmentalists is now suggesting that adding very small amounts of a particular seaweed to cows' diets could radically reduce the amount of methane cows release.That particular seaweed, Asparagopsis taxiformis, apparently produces a compound called bromoform that neutralizes the enzymes that produce methane in a cow's stomach.All of this is very interesting, of course, in a surreal sort of way.The truly strange thing is, that climate fanatics are getting so preposterous in their proposals that it is harder and harder to distinguish serious climate news from satirical pieces in the Onion.Follow Thomas D.

""Because maybe he wants to run in four years... or maybe he doesn't know how to win. I mean, who can really know?"" Trump said.The view that Ryan ""doesn't know how to win,"" however, neglects the reality that both Ryan and Clinton share a progressive, globalist worldview, which is at odds with Trump's ""America first"" approach. Indeed, both Clinton and Ryan have said that they see themselves as representatives not only for American citizens, but also for foreign nationals and foreign interests. This view that the needs of foreign citizens are equal to the needs of American citizens reflects the belief that Americans are only part of many interest groups that a lawmaker ought to consider when crafting legislation--even as he or she negotiates with other countries, which always put their citizens first.""I am delighted to be the Senator from Punjab [India] as well as from New York,"" Clinton reportedly told a group of Indian-Americans on Capitol Hill in 2005. ""I can certainly run for the Senate seat in Punjab and win easily,"" Clinton told a group of Indian donors on a separate occasion. Clinton's remarks became the subject of a hard-hitting 2007 memo circulated by the Obama campaign that labeled his Democratic primary opponent as ""Hillary Clinton (D-Punjab)""- implying that Clinton represents foreign nations and citizens rather than her own American constituents.Similarly, Ryan has said that he, too, sees his role as a U.S. lawmaker to be the representative of foreign nationals--and, in particular, foreign citizens of India. In 2013, Ryan said he believes that it's the job of a U.S. lawmaker to ""put yourself in... [the] shoes"" of foreign citizens such as ""the gentleman from India who's waiting for his green card.""Both Clinton and Ryan view being American as an intellectual ""idea"" rather than a national identity, and both support the donor-class's agenda of open borders, which--as Bernie Sanders has explained--essentially amounts to ""doing away with the concept of a nation-state.""The Clintons have long advocated for their desire to establish a ""genuine global community"" with ""open borders"" and ""easy immigration."" Just last month, Clinton's campaign went so far as to indicate that she believes the world has a global right to immigrate to the United States. Similarly, Ryan has a two-decade long history of pushing for open borders--even going so far as to stump for open borders policies alongside Luis Guterriez, who has previously said that his ""only one loyalty"" is to foreign migrants. Gutierrez, who is Congress's most vocal proponent for open borders, both backed Ryan for House Speaker last year and has endorsed Clinton for president.The open borders, internationalist worldview of Clinton and Ryan stands diametrically opposed to the ""America first"" agenda of Donald Trump, who has pledged that the needs of America and her citizens--not the desires of foreign interests--will be his priority.""On trade, on immigration, on foreign policy, the jobs, incomes and security of the American worker will always be my first priority,"" Trump has said. ""America first will be the major and overriding theme of my administration."" [My policies] will always put the interests of the American people and American security above all else... no country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests firsts. Both our friends and our enemies put their countries above ours and we, while being fair to them, must start doing the same. We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism. The nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony.The overwhelming similarities between the goals of establishment leaders in both political parties and the goals of their wealthy corporate donors recently prompted far-left Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein to denounce Hillary Clinton as a ""corporatist"" and the face of ""#TheNewRepublicanParty.""""Both Democrats and Republicans are funded by big corporate interests,"" Stein wrote, noting that these members of Washington's ""uni-party"" are united in their shared desire to advance the goals of their wealthy donors rather than the desires of the people. Stein and her party have argued that the Democratic and Republican parties that ""cuddle up to Wall Street and special interests"" essentially ""agree on [a] neoliberal agenda"" of ""globalization... [and] austerity for the rest of us.""The divide between progressive globalism and nation-state conservatism perhaps helps to illuminate why Ryan has spent months both quietly and loudly undermining his own party's nominee for president.Just this past week, Ryan denounced concerns about voter fraud expressed by his Party's nominee-insisting that the election results will be inherently secure. Ryan's spokesman told Buzzfeed that the Republican House Speaker is ""fully confident"" the election will be carried out ""with integrity.""The statement from Ryan's office is remarkable given the fact that a 2014 report from the Washington Post documented how non-citizen foreign nationals illegally voting in U.S. elections ""likely gave"" Democrats the pivotal 60th vote necessary to pass Obamacare. This means that, despite the fact that the healthcare law Ryan claims to oppose may only have been enacted because foreign citizens illegally cast their ballots in U.S. elections, Ryan decided to directly contradict his nominee and preemptively sanction the results of the election.Similarly, the morning after the second presidential debate, Ryan held a conference call with his fellow House GOP members to announce that he would no longer defend his party's nominee. Political commentators observed that Ryan's announcement immediately overtook that day's news cycle, which otherwise-commentators argue-would likely have been about Trump's largely well-received debate performance against Clinton. Some suggested that it seemed as though Ryan's announcement was done with the goal of ""intentionally hurting Trump.""Nationally syndicated conservative talk radio host Laura Ingraham blasted Ryan for his ""maddening"" decision to singlehandedly turn a news cycle that would have been about Trump's ""masterful debate performance"" into ""a story about himself on a moral high horse, looking down on the plain of all the plebes.""Mickey Kaus noted that Ryan seemed to have ""stag[ed]"" the ""anti-Trump phone call [to] step on [the] story of [Trump's] solid debate comeback""""Clearly @SpeakerRyan stepped on Trump's debate news w/ his conference call. Gave [networks] an alternative story. He couldn't have waited a day?"" Kaus tweeted.Garrett Epps, a correspondent with The Atlantic and professor at the University of Baltimore Law School, responded to Kaus: ""It's puzzling. Almost as if he doesn't want Trump to win...bizarre.""Kaus replied to Epps noting that that Ryan's ""goal"" may have been to ""intentionally hur[t] Trump... With Hillary, Ryan might get his amnesty,"" Kaus observed.Indeed, Tim Kaine has previously explained how under a President Clinton and Speaker Ryan, amnesty would be enacted within the first 100 days of a Clinton-Kaine administration.Interestingly, on the day that WikiLeaks released emails revealing that Clinton told foreign bankers that her ""dream"" is to enact ""open orders."" Instead of forcefully denouncing Clinton's private declarations, Ryan chose to issue a statement on a decade-old audio tape that revealed Trump's locker-room style conversation caught on hot mic. Ryan's announcement that he was ""sickened"" by Trump's banter--and the fallout of Republican support that accompanied Ryan's statement--overshadowed much of the news coverage that the revelation of Clinton's embrace for open borders might have otherwise received.Former Ryan advisor Dan Senor was upfront about his desire for corporate media to focus on negative news stories for Trump and not cover Trump's comeback debate performance. Senor even encouraged members of corporate media to skew their coverage to emphasize the decade-old audio tape that Ryan was ""sickened"" by and to act ""as though the debate never occurred.""Yet these attempts to seemingly sabotage Trump are hardly a recent development from Ryan. Over the last several months, the Speaker has made a habit of both of overtly and subtly undermining his party's nominee.Just prior to Trump's cinching the Republican nomination, Ryan indicated to Capitol Hill reporters that he disavowed Trump's campaign pledge to enforce U.S. immigration law. Ryan also made clear that he would not include Trump's signature policy platforms on trade or immigration in the House GOP 2017 policy agenda. A recent report by The Atlantic spotlighted how Ryan, to this day, continues to oppose Trump on a wide range of issues from entitlements to infrastructure, to trade, to foreign alliances, to immigration, and to crime.After Trump won his party's nomination, Ryan dragged out his decision to endorse Trump for weeks--leaving voters with the distinct impression that Ryan does not consider the choice between Trump versus Clinton to be an easy one.After he finally issued his tepid endorsement of Trump, Ryan continued to be one of Trump's most frequent public critics--making repeated declarations in high-profile media appearances that would seem to undermine the party's presumptive nominee.Beyond simply what Ryan has said to seemingly undermine Trump, it's also a matter of what Ryan has not said. For instance, Ryan has scarcely discussed the WikiLeaks revelations regarding Hillary Clinton or the pay-for-play tactics of the Clinton Foundation. Nor has Ryan forcefully spoken out against Clinton's declaration to Goldman Sachs that Americans who want to limit immigration are ""fundamentally un-American""--an astonishing statement given the fact that according to Pew polling data, 83% of the American electorate would like to see immigration levels frozen or reduced.Instead, Ryan has seemed much more aggressive in attacking Trump during interviews about the election than he has been in going after Hillary Clinton.In fact, Ryan has frequently given fuel to many of the corporate media's narratives against Trump--by not only refusing to defend his party's nominee against his critics, but also by subsequently joining in on the left's pile on of Trump after the nominee was forced to fight back against his critics himself.For instance, as the corporate media was giving round-the-clock coverage to the Khan family's attacks against Trump for wanting to curb Islamic migration, Ryan opted to join in on Clinton's pile on against the Republican nominee.The Washington Post documented Ryan's repeated refusal to support his nominee in a piece titled, ""Paul Ryan Endorsed Donald Trump One Month Ago. He Hasn't Agreed With Him Since.""The piece notes how after ""endorsing"" Trump, Ryan continued to find ""fault with the positions of his party's standard-bearer"" and went so far as to denounce some of Trump's comments as ""the textbook definition of a racist comment"" and even accused Trump of employing ""anti-Semitic"" messaging.Ryan, who leads the pro-Islamic migration wing of the Republican party, has repeatedly rejected Trump's call for curbing Muslim migration- despite the fact that Trump's plan is supported by seven in ten Wisconsin Republican voters.In a sit-down interview with anti-Trump publication the Huffington Post, Ryan even suggested that he'd be open to suing a President Trump if he were to enact a temporary pause on Muslim migration. Ryan said that he is not giving Trump ""a blank check"" with his endorsement. His statement is significant because it suggests that he intends to be a greater check on his own party's president than he has been on President Obama, who has systematically dismantled U.S. immigration law with the help of funding provided by congressional Republicans.Other examples of Ryan's efforts to undermine Trump have been more subtle. For instance, during a CNN town hall interview with Jake Tapper, Ryan directly undercut his nominee's messaging strategy at a time when Trump was trying to grow the party's tent and appeal to blue-collar voters. When Tapper asked Ryan if he has ""more common ground"" on issues like trade and foreign policy with Clinton than he does with Trump, Ryan said, ""No, no... she sounds like Bernie Sanders on trade. She basically says the same thing he does."" Ryan's statement was false--Clinton does not hold the same views on trade as Sanders, a fact she made perfectly clear in her speeches to foreign bankers. Yet by insisting that Clinton supports Sanders' view on trade, the Republican House Speaker was openly contradicting the messaging strategy of his party and his party's nominee as Trump was trying to reach out to Bernie Sanders voters on the issue of trade.Yet Ryan's actions have not gone unnoticed by conservatives.Over the summer, Sean Hannity said that he was ""sick"" of Ryan's ""open effort... to sabotage"" Trump. ""Maybe it's time to get a new Speaker,"" Hannity said. He reiterated this call earlier this week, accusing Ryan and other members of the Republican establishment of ""stabbing"" Trump in the back and ""sabotaging"" his campaign.California Republican Congressman Dana Rohrabacher, who voted for Ryan as House Speaker last year, is now calling Ryan ""cowardly"" and ""gutless"" for his treatment of Trump. ""It's not good leadership,"" Rohrabacher said.Congressman Jim Bridenstine, who similarly backed Ryan for Speaker, has indicated that he cannot support Ryan if Ryan does not support Trump over Clinton. ""Given the stakes of this election, if Paul Ryan isn't for Trump, then I'm not for Paul Ryan,"" Bridenstine tweeted.The push to remove Ryan as Speaker is ""picking up some steam,"" said Congressman Mark Meadows-who also voted for Ryan last year after leading the charge to remove Ryan's predecessor, John Boehner, as Speaker. Meadows explained that a lot of conservatives now ""question the loyalty of the Speaker"" in light of Ryan's treatment of Trump.Fox Business host Lou Dobbs called on Ryan to step aside for his efforts to ""undercut"" Trump in his fight against Clinton.""[Paul Ryan] should have the character to step aside,"" Dobbs said. ""I don't think he should survive this... This man shouldn't be there.""""[Ryan] understands the consequences of what he does. If he undercuts Trump to the point that he loses the election, he'll be responsible for the next three Supreme Court justices, [and] the direction of the country,"" Dobbs said.""Ryan has no concept of his responsibility as Speaker... and his duty to the nation,"" Dobbs added, noting that Ryan's future has become ""intertwined"" with that of Hillary Clinton's. ""He is a laughing stock leader. He is a small man dressed up in a big job... Ryan should no more be Speaker of the House than Hillary Clinton should be President of the United States. And make no mistake, the future of those two are intertwined.""Indeed, the Washington Post recently speculated about the future relationship of the could-be Clinton-Ryan Washington power couple. ""Their relationship could become Washington's most important in determining whether the federal government functions over the next four years,"" the Washington Post wrote.Pat Caddell and others have observed that the revelation of the quiet alliance between the establishments of both parties--praised by corporate media and denounced by grassroots conservatives and liberal progressives like Jill Stein--may prove to be one of the most significant outcomes of the 2016 election and could prove ruinous for the Republican Party. As recent reports have highlighted, in a post-2016 political environment it remains unclear whether the Republican Party can maintain its current structure of being controlled by congressional leaders who represent the desires of the party's donors but undermine the interests of its voters.MSNBC host Joe Scarborough recently explained, ""I got bad news for Hugh Hewitt, the American Enterprise Institute, the Republican leadership, all the fundraisers -- Paul Ryan is not the leader of the party. The party believes Donald Trump is the leader of the party.""Indeed, recent polling shows that a majority of Republican voters say that Trump better represents their views than Ryan. In fact, on the seminal issues of trade and immigration, polling shows that Ryan stands opposed to nine in ten of GOP voters. Many conservatives have noted it would be hard to envision Nancy Pelosi as the Congressional leader of her Party if she opposed nine in ten of her base's voters on core progressive values.""We are on the verge of seeing the Republican Party go the way of the Whigs,"" Pat Caddell told Breitbart News exclusively. The Party is ""at war with their voters. They are literally abandoning their own. The very base that has nominated Trump is a base that Paul Ryan can ill-afford to alienate, but on the other hand, he doesn't believe in them. He does not believe what they believe... Having lost all of their citadels of strength, the party leaders have now abandoned all of their principles. Paul Ryan is in real trouble.""Caddell explained that Paul Ryan is the ""voice"" of a Washington establishment that has ""absolutely made clear"" that it would prefer Clinton over Trump. ""What you have is a Bush and Clinton dynasty. And the curtain has risen on the corruption that they're all in the same game and that ultimately they're allies. That's what the American people have been revolting about. I fear that the establishment's mind doesn't even understand that that's what the base is revolting against."" [My policies] will always put the interests of the American people and American security above all else... no country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests firsts. Both our friends and our enemies put their countries above ours and we, while being fair to them, must start doing the same.

27	http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/21/n-c-gop-governor-closes-polling-gap-as-transgender-demand-mobilizes-conservative-voters/	N.C. GOP Governor Closes Polling Gap as Transgender Demand Mobilizes Conservative Voters	"North Carolina's GOP governor has closed a 5-point polling gap with his Democratic rival in the last two weeks, as voters push back against the Democrats' use of the transgender bathroom controversy to tarnish the governor's successful economic record. SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER On Oct. 1, Gov. Pat McCrory was at 44.2 percent, or 3.6 points behind Attorney General Roy Cooper, according to Real Clear Polling's average of polling results. Almost three weeks later, on Oct. 19, McCrory was half a point behind at 46.3 percent, and climbing fast.Local GOP officials are eager to credit McCrory's economic record for the rise. ""As we get down to the final days of the election and voters have to make a decision about who they want to be governor, they are realizing that the governor has been doing his job and getting results while the attorney general hasn't for 16 years,"" said the governor's spokesman, Ricky Diaz. ""Governor McCrory's rise in the polls is not surprising when you consider that North Carolina has the fastest growing economy in the nation, people are keeping more of their hard-earned money from the generous tax cuts including those for the middle class and small business owners, and over 300,000 new sustainable jobs have been created over the last four years,"" said a statement from Kami Mueller, communications director at the North Carolina Republican Party.But McCrory is also gaining in the polls because he's gradually stood up to defend the state's civic society against the Democrats' use of the ""transgender rights"" claim to help their long-term goal of barring government officials from recognizing the biological and social differences between boy and girls, men and women.Conservatives are rallying to McCrory's defense of normal society, ""as they have the opportunity to hear [him, because] the media has refused to tell the story,"" says Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council. ""I don't agree with the concept of redefining gender -- that is  major societal change, but it is being passed off as a political battle,"" McCrory told a group of pastors at an Oct. 7 meeting hosted by the Family Research Council. ""I've had to do a lot of study on this... I'd never heard of it,"" until gay advocates threatened to hammer the state's economy and to spend millions of campaign dollars against him, unless he rejected the state legislation which affirms the difference between men and women. Conservatives in the state need to rise up against this gender ideology, despite growing pressure by the media, business groups, Democrats, and transgender-sympathetic friends, he said. The radicals ""have the media on their side, and they have a lot of [public] support because people don't understand the issue"" behind the call for transgender bathrooms, he said. ""You're going to have be direct in informing people about this, because [gay activists and the media] are confusing everybody,"" he said. ""The silent majority had got to quit being silent [and] you have four weeks to do it,"" he said. Since early 2016, gay advocacy groups have organized a national economic boycott of the state, supposedly to protect the right of transgender people to use the bathrooms they prefer. However, that push for transgender rights is only part of the opposition to the so-called ""HB2"" privacy and security law.The HB2 law preserves routine distinctions between men and women in school and public bathrooms and locker rooms by overriding a city ordinance in Charlotte which said people who are transgender -- regardless of appearance, therapy, or biology -- can use either the male or female public bathrooms. The law is a compromise because it says that people who want to use public toilets and locker-rooms in the state must use the facility reserved for their male or female sex -- but it also allows transgender people to use the opposite sex's facilities once they've undergone surgery and legally changed the sex on their birth certificate.Nationally, only about one in every 2,400 Americans have changed their name from one sex to another, according to a recent study of the 2010 census. Even pro-transgender advocates say that only one in every 160 Americans fit into a very broad definition of ""transgender.""That compromise is anathema to gay activists because it legislatively reinforces what they describe as ""the gender binary,"" which is academic jargon for the public's view that society consists of male and female, with only a few mixed-sex people in between.Gay and feminist activists really want legislators, judges, scientists, and schools to suppress the idea that society consists of just males and females. The activists instead want a society where the government forces Americans to recognize and praise so many types of gender identities and sexual orientations that there just isn't any normal type of sexual identity. They are pushing for that goal because if there's no normal, there's no reason for society to favor and praise the normal heterosexual men and women who jointly create each new  generation of Americans.But without the assumption that men and women are normal, distinct, and different, many evolved civic rules would become political battlegrounds in North Carolina and all of the United States.Single-sex bathrooms and locker-rooms; single-sex sports leagues and women's shelters; free speech, law enforcement, and social cooperation; science education, parental guidance of children's sexual development and health -- all become new political battlegrounds if government officials treat people's self-declared ""gender identity"" as more legally important than their biological sex.The push to bury the idea of normal sexuality ""sends a confusing message to children,"" said Perkins. It is problematic when you starting going into elementary or  junior schools telling kids there's no difference between gender ... kids are going through puberty, which is almost like going through re-entry from space -- they're disoriented, they're confused about a lot of things -- and to say that [teenage moods are] permanent, that it is problematic because it prevents the kids from going through the normal stages of life to normal maturity.Since this summer, gay activists have persuaded numerous business allies and the university presidents who run sports leagues to cancel investments and sports tournaments in North Carolina. McCrory has repeatedly blamed the boycott on his rival, Roy Cooper. ""He's promoting the boycott,"" McCrory told the pastors.Cooper has also received extensive donations from gay activists, including activists in New York, as well as a flood of activists and media support from gay groups. Also, President Barack Obama and his deputies in the Department of Justice are trying to help Cooper. In May, he weighed in with threats to cut federal school and transportation funding unless the state's voters agreed to the federal demand that a person can freely and frequently change their declared sex, regardless of biology. ""Transgender men are men -- they live, work and study as men. Transgender women are women -- they live, work and study as women,"" Vanita Gupta, the acting assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division, said May 9. In her campaign visits to the state, Clinton also slams McCrory for support of the law that preserves the distinctions between male and female. In September, according to the Charlotte Business Journal, Clinton told her state supporters that:HB2 is another example of trying to discriminate against people that doesn't have any place in our modern society,"" Clinton said during her speech at Johnson C. Smith. ""You see this first-hand in North Carolina. Discrimination is not only wrong, it's bad for business. The NBA, you know, canceled the (All-Star) game. PayPal canceled 400 jobs (in Charlotte). Others are not coming to this beautiful state. Because they don't want to be associated with the discriminatory, bigoted policies of your governor and legislature.That pro-transgender pitch is a close match for the Clinton 2016 campaign, Perkins told Breitbart News. ""This ties right into Hillary Clinton and her campaign and the entire left's disdain for people who believe their faith is something to guide their lives by,"" he said. ""It goes back to her description [of conservatives] as 'a basket of deplorables,'"" he said.Polls show that Obama-backed gender ideology is very unpopular -- but it is largely overshadowed by the media's effort to blame McCrory for the economic boycott of the state.Cooper was also aided by the Justice Department's decision to launch an investigation of McCrory's administration. The investigation led nowhere, and was quietly shut down, but it gave Cooper a talking point for the Oct. 18 candidate's debate. McCrory quickly knocked that claim down, and the federal officials admitted the next day that the previously secret investigation had ended without charges -- but the episode allowed the federal Democrats and local media to further hammer McCrory.McCrory and other GOP officials are now charging Cooper with breaking privacy laws by announcing the secret investigation during the debate.""Roy Cooper showed the true depths of his ineptitude by his willingness to do or say anything for his own political gain,"" said GOP spokeswoman Mueller. ""As the state's top law enforcement officer and attorney, Cooper egregiously broke laws of ethics and rules of the North Carolina State Bar in his drive-by attempt to defame the sitting Governor of North Carolina,"" she said. ""Roy Cooper has been an embarrassment as North Carolina's attorney general for the last 16 years, and his performance in the last debate solidified he would be just as embarrassing and inept if he were to be elected governor,"" she added. 
It is problematic when you starting going into elementary or  junior schools telling kids there's no difference between gender ... kids are going through puberty, which is almost like going through re-entry from space -- they're disoriented, they're confused about a lot of things -- and to say that [teenage moods are] permanent, that it is problematic because it prevents the kids from going through the normal stages of life to normal maturity.

HB2 is another example of trying to discriminate against people that doesn't have any place in our modern society,"" Clinton said during her speech at Johnson C. Smith. ""You see this first-hand in North Carolina. Discrimination is not only wrong, it's bad for business. The NBA, you know, canceled the (All-Star) game. PayPal canceled 400 jobs (in Charlotte). Others are not coming to this beautiful state. Because they don't want to be associated with the discriminatory, bigoted policies of your governor and legislature.
SIGN UPNorth Carolina's GOP governor has closed a 5-point polling gap with his Democratic rival in the last two weeks, as voters push back against the Democrats' use of the transgender bathroom controversy to tarnish the governor's successful economic record.  On Oct. 1, Gov. Pat McCrory was at 44.2 percent, or 3.6 points behind Attorney General Roy Cooper, according to Real Clear Polling's average of polling results. Almost three weeks later, on Oct. 19, McCrory was half a point behind at 46.3 percent, and climbing fast.Local GOP officials are eager to credit McCrory's economic record for the rise. ""As we get down to the final days of the election and voters have to make a decision about who they want to be governor, they are realizing that the governor has been doing his job and getting results while the attorney general hasn't for 16 years,"" said the governor's spokesman, Ricky Diaz. ""Governor McCrory's rise in the polls is not surprising when you consider that North Carolina has the fastest growing economy in the nation, people are keeping more of their hard-earned money from the generous tax cuts including those for the middle class and small business owners, and over 300,000 new sustainable jobs have been created over the last four years,"" said a statement from Kami Mueller, communications director at the North Carolina Republican Party.Conservatives are rallying to McCrory's defense of normal society, ""as they have the opportunity to hear [him, because] the media has refused to tell the story,"" says Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council. ""I don't agree with the concept of redefining gender -- that is  major societal change, but it is being passed off as a political battle,"" McCrory told a group of pastors at an Oct. 7 meeting hosted by the Family Research Council.   ""I've had to do a lot of study on this... I'd never heard of it,"" until gay advocates threatened to hammer the state's economy and to spend millions of campaign dollars against him, unless he rejected the state legislation which affirms the difference between men and women. Conservatives in the state need to rise up against this gender ideology, despite growing pressure by the media, business groups, Democrats, and transgender-sympathetic friends, he said. The radicals ""have the media on their side, and they have a lot of [public] support because people don't understand the issue"" behind the call for transgender bathrooms, he said. ""You're going to have be direct in informing people about this, because [gay activists and the media] are confusing everybody,"" he said. ""The silent majority had got to quit being silent [and] you have four weeks to do it,"" he said. Since early 2016, gay advocacy groups have organized a national economic boycott of the state, supposedly to protect the right of transgender people to use the bathrooms they prefer. However, that push for transgender rights is only part of the opposition to the so-called ""HB2"" privacy and security law.The HB2 law preserves routine distinctions between men and women in school and public bathrooms and locker rooms by overriding a city ordinance in Charlotte which said people who are transgender -- regardless of appearance, therapy, or biology -- can use either the male or female public bathrooms. The law is a compromise because it says that people who want to use public toilets and locker-rooms in the state must use the facility reserved for their male or female sex -- but it also allows transgender people to use the opposite sex's facilities once they've undergone surgery and legally changed the sex on their birth certificate.Nationally, only about one in every 2,400 Americans have changed their name from one sex to another, according to a recent study of the 2010 census. Even pro-transgender advocates say that only one in every 160 Americans fit into a very broad definition of ""transgender.""Gay and feminist activists really want legislators, judges, scientists, and schools to suppress the idea that society consists of just males and females. The activists instead want a society where the government forces Americans to recognize and praise so many types of gender identities and sexual orientations that there just isn't any normal type of sexual identity. They are pushing for that goal because if there's no normal, there's no reason for society to favor and praise the normal heterosexual men and women who jointly create each new  generation of Americans.But without the assumption that men and women are normal, distinct, and different, many evolved civic rules would become political battlegrounds in North Carolina and all of the United States.Single-sex bathrooms and locker-rooms; single-sex sports leagues and women's shelters; free speech, law enforcement, and social cooperation; science education, parental guidance of children's sexual development and health -- all become new political battlegrounds sends a confusing message to children,"" said Perkins. It is problematic when you starting going into elementary or  junior schools telling kids there's no difference between gender ... kids are going through puberty, which is almost like going through re-entry from space -- they're disoriented, they're confused about a lot of things -- and to say that [teenage moods are] permanent, that it is problematic because it prevents the kids from going through the normal stages of life to normal maturity.Since this summer, gay activists have persuaded numerous business allies and the university presidents who run sports leagues to cancel investments and sports tournaments in North Carolina. McCrory has repeatedly blamed the boycott on his rival, Roy Cooper. ""He's promoting the boycott,"" McCrory told the pastors.Cooper has also received extensive donations from gay activists, including activists in New York, as well as a flood of activists and media support from gay groups. Also, President Barack Obama and his deputies in the Department of Justice are trying to help Cooper. In May, he weighed in with threats to cut federal school and transportation funding unless the state's voters agreed to the federal demand that a person can freely and frequently change their declared sex, regardless of biology. ""Transgender men are men -- they live, work and study as men. Transgender women are women -- they live, work and study as women,"" Vanita Gupta, the acting assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division, said May 9. That pro-transgender pitch is a close match for the Clinton 2016 campaign, Perkins told Breitbart News. ""This ties right into Hillary Clinton and her campaign and the entire left's disdain for people who believe their faith is something to guide their lives by,"" he said. ""It goes back to her description [of conservatives] as 'a basket of deplorables,'"" he said.Polls show that Obama-backed gender ideology is very unpopular -- but it is largely overshadowed by the media's effort to blame McCrory for the economic boycott of the state.""Roy Cooper showed the true depths of his ineptitude by his willingness to do or say anything for his own political gain,"" said GOP spokeswoman Mueller. ""As the state's top law enforcement officer and attorney, Cooper egregiously broke laws of ethics and rules of the North Carolina State Bar in his drive-by attempt to defame the sitting Governor of North Carolina,"" she said. ""Roy Cooper has been an embarrassment as North Carolina's attorney general for the last 16 years, and his performance in the last debate solidified he would be just as embarrassing and inept if he were to be elected governor,"" she added.
