Bannon, Ignore Democrat Keith Ellison’s Radicalism	"After news broke that President-elect Donald Trump appointed Stephen K. Bannon as his chief White House strategist, the media unleashed a torrent of attacks calling Bannon an extremist, a ""white nationalist,"" and a ""racist"" in order to force Trump to rescind his offer to add Bannon to his White House staff.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBut after Muslim Congressman Keith Ellison was floated as the possible new head of the Democrat National Committee, the same media completely ignored his repeated anti-Semitic and radical Islamic statements.According to a new study by the Media Research Center, the big three networks have spent almost no time at all revealing the radical Islamic leanings of Minnesota Democrat Kieth Ellison while repeatedly attacking Bannon with rumor, innuendo, and hearsay.Since November 13, ABC, CBS, and NBC went on a feeding frenzy against Bannon, spending 41 minutes and 46 seconds covering Trump's announcement of Bannon's inclusion on the White House staff. Unsurprisingly, fully 74 percent of that coverage was negative. Indeed, the only positive comments about the new chief strategist were the reports of comments uttered by other Trump officials.Bannon has been called every manner of name based solely on innuendo. No actual proof has been forthcoming, but the big three nets have been vicious.On the other hand, coverage of Representative Keith Ellison has been practically non-existent despite that his name has been offered as the replacement of now disgraced interim Democrat National Committee Chair Donna Brazile.The networks, though, have only given Ellison a scant two minutes and nine seconds of coverage, according to the MRC study. Unsurprisingly, absolutely zero of that time has been negative coverage.This sparse, yet fawning coverage of Ellison was had despite the rising voice of concern by Jewish groups worried over his past radical Muslim statements.The networks also ignored Ellison's praise and support of anti-Semitic Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakahn, his support of reparations for slavery, and his demands that the U.S. government set aside land inside the country for a new black ""homeland.""Ellison also has a ""history of Muslim Brotherhood connections,"" according to terrorism expert Steve Emerson.Yet, the media has ignored all Ellison's controversial ties, all the while going mad over Stephen Bannon.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.SIGN UP"

I love the fact that they are ultra-dependable, and I like the nostalgic aspect of carrying a wheel gun for self-defense. Moreover, although many 21st century revolvers offer multiple caliber options, I like the tried and true .38 Special round and the forever formidable .357 Magnum.For anyone not familiar with revolvers, it is important to note that the ones chambered in .357 Magnum will also shoot .38 Special -- so by buying a .357 revolver, you actually get two guns (or a gun that shoots two rounds). The .38 Special has far less recoil and is a particularly popular with female concealed carriers or anyone who wants to carry a gun that combines stopping power with reduced recoil.Taurus Model 85 (.38 Special) -- The Taurus Model 85 is a no-frills snub nose revolver chambered in .38 Special +P. This means it will shoot regular .38 Special or higher pressure/velocity self-defense loads with hollow point bullets. And it will do it well. The 85 is a classic revolver which means it is double action/single action -- i.e., you can pull the hammer back and release it with a long pull on the trigger or you can cock the hammer with your thumb then fire a round via a very short pull on the trigger.The revolver is light -- weighing in at 22.2 ounces -- and it holds five rounds of ammunition. It is super easy to use, extremely concealable, and comfortable to carry on one's person, in a purse, or in a backpack. The 85 also comes with a built-in internal lock that can be activated with a key. Once activated, the gun is inoperable -- it cannot fire. This is an option some people like when the gun is going to be stored for long periods of time or when small children are nearby.Approximate price for a Model 85 -- $375.TaurusSmith & Wesson Model 637 (.38 Special) -- The Smith & Wesson Model 637 is chambered in .38 Special +P, just like the Taurus Model 85. The 637 also operates on the same double action/single action platform as the Model 85, and it holds five rounds of ammunition like the Taurus. The real differences between the two guns come down to weight and differences in trigger feel. The Model 637 weights 14.03 ounces -- roughly 8 ounces lighter than the Model 85 -- and its trigger feels different. The feel is mush smoother -- therefore better -- in the minds of some, but not different enough to bicker about in the minds of others. It's super lightweight -- ""airweight"" according to Smith & Wesson -- which makes it a gun that lends itself to concealment and everyday carry; whether on one's person, in a purse, or in a backpack.Approximate price for a Model 637 -- $480.Smith & WessonCharter Arms Undercover Lite Standard (.38 Special) -- The Charter Arms Undercover Light Standard is a five-shot revolver that is considerably different from the Taurus Model 85 or the Smith & Wesson Model 637. Those differences lie in the mechanism Charter arms uses to lock the firearm's cylinder into place and in the length of the grip. The cylinder lockup differences do not impact the way you use the gun in the slightest, they are simply apparent when you first look at the gun. On the other hand, the length of the grip does provide some key differences in that it allows you to get one more finger on the grip, thereby making recoil easier to control. The longer grip also means someone who tries to wrestle the gun out of your hand better pack a lunch; it's not going to be easy. The drawback of the longer grip is that it makes the Lite Standard's handle slightly longer than the handle on Taurus Model 85 or the Smith & Wesson Model 637, which means the handle can cause a bulge under certain shirts during concealed carry. This is not a problem once you ascertain which shirts to carry it under. On the other hand, the Lite Standard weighs in at 12 ounces-approximately 10 ounces lighter than the Taurus and 2 ounces lighter than the Smith & Wesson-which mean the comfort of carrying is nearly unmatched.The drawback of the longer grip is that it makes the Lite Standard's handle slightly longer than the handle on Taurus Model 85 or the Smith & Wesson Model 637, which means the handle can cause a bulge under certain shirts during concealed carry. This is not a problem once you ascertain which shirts to carry it under. On the other hand, the Lite Standard weighs in at 12 ounces -- approximately 10 ounces lighter than the Taurus and 2 ounces lighter than the Smith & Wesson -- which means the comfort of carrying is nearly unmatched.Approximate price for a Lite Standard -- $370.Charter ArmsRuger LCR (.357 Magnum) -- The Ruger LCR is a double action revolver with a concealed hammer, hidden within the frame of the gun and covered by ""fire control housing"" to prevent snagging when pulling the gun from your pocket or from beneath a shirt under duress. The frame of the LCR is made of polymer to reduce weight, while the components under stress are made from steel. The LCR weighs in at 17.1 ounces. It holds five rounds of .357 Magnum ammunition or five rounds of .38 Special and/or .38 Special +P. The LCR is a great gun for those looking for a self-defense weapon that is comfortable and easy to carry at all times. It is ultra-reliable (after all, it's a Ruger), and it is durable. The hidden hammer makes this gun especially apropos for being carried in a purse or backpack, as concerns over getting hair ties, bracelets, etc., tangled around the hammer are gone.Approximate price for a Ruger LCR -- $520 to $550.RugerRuger SP101 (.357 Magnum) -- The Ruger SP101 is a workhorse. It is heavier than other revolvers in this list -- weighs in at 26 ounces -- and the barrel is longer, making the gun roughly an inch longer than a snubby like the Smith & Wesson Model 637. However, that being said, the extra weight and size of the SP101 translate into less-felt recoil which, in turn, translates to better control. And if you use .38 Special and/or .38 Special +P instead of .357 Magnum, the recoil is reduced even further. The SP101 is not a purse gun like some of the other firearms on this list. It is better suited for an inside the waistband holster or an outside the waistband holster. It is spot-on for an open carry revolver.Approximate price for a Ruger SP101 -- $560 to $580.There are myriad accessories available for all five of these revolvers. From holsters by Fobus, Alien Gear, and Clinger to aftermarket grips with built-in lasers by Crimson Trace. In fact, many of the revolvers in this list are available in models that come equipped with Crimson Trace laser grips.As with all firearm purchases, be sure you know the laws of your state and, upon acquiring a gun, take the time to familiarize yourself with it. Familiarization contributes to safety and confidence, and both will be needed if you have to pull the gun and use it in the blink of an eye to defend your life and/or liberty.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of ""Bullets with AWR Hawkins,"" a Breitbart News podcast.

The ""Trump under-performed Romney"" meme was launched by grabbing an incomplete total from 2016 and comparing it to final official counts from 2012 and 2008, which were logged days after those elections were held, and the last votes had been counted.According to the Federal Election Commission, John McCain received 59,948,323 votes in 2008.Mitt Romney collected 60,933,504 votes in 2012.As of Wednesday afternoon, the Cook Political Report posted 61,300,582 votes for Donald Trump, and votes are still being counted.CNN and the Associated Press have posted slightly lower grand totals for Trump--60,835,201 and 60,834,437 respectively, as of Wednesday afternoon. Fox News is currently showing the same total as CNN.Those totals are most likely lagging behind the Cook Report's real-time tally, but even if the lower Associated Press number somehow held up as the final Trump total, he'd have more votes than McCain, and would trail Romney by less than 100,000 votes. That would technically keep the ""Romney won more votes than Trump"" talking point alive, but it would hardly seem useful for arguing that Trump seriously under-performed the 2012 candidate.At any rate, what good would come from a strategy that delivered more popular votes, without scoring the electoral votes needed for victory? Trump himself was on very solid ground when he noted that if the popular vote was the key to the election, he would have campaigned differently. He was confident he could still have beaten Hillary Clinton with such a strategy. Is there any doubt he would have pulled in a far higher vote total than Romney? Then again, what would Mitt Romney's strategy in 2012 have been, if he had been seeking to maximize his popular vote, instead of winning the Electoral College?SIGN UP"

As proof that the end was near, he triumphantly reported: ""The Dow futures dropped 700 points overnight."" After a brief drop, the Dow surged to historic highs, recording its biggest weekly gain in five years.But I can't wait to read the letters these guys wrote to their children about Bill Clinton! Don't leave us hanging guys -- post those, too, please.In Hiplandia, ""I couldn't stop crying!"" and ""I vomited!"" are dispositive proof that Trump is a bad man -- not that these people are mentally unbalanced. Their own paranoia is cited to show how evil their enemies are.It's supposed to say something about Trump that people are posting little homilies titled: ""How to Tell a Child Donald Trump Won the Election."" (Google produces 60 million hits for that idea.)In fact, that tells us nothing whatsoever about Trump, but does tell us that liberal parents are intentionally raising neurotics by telling their children that they are living in Nazi Germany.Americans who make $20,000 a year are made fun of by Samantha Bee for going to Wal-Mart.These are all people who will knife one another in the back to get their kids into $50,000-a-year all-white preschools. But they think they're less racist than other Americans because of their pleasant interactions with Rosa when she comes to clean.In the modern Democratic Party, out-of-work coal miners are constantly denounced for their ""privilege"" by half-black girls at Yale -- who wouldn't have gotten in without the black half -- and who will be paid a quarter-million dollars as the ""diversity coordinator"" at some Fortune 500 corporation.Apparently the new method of developing opinions is to figure out what's trendy and allowing celebrities and comedians to act as your personal shoppers.I'm just so busy, I don't have time to know things. Could you help me pick out my views?Absolutely! I've got some great opinions for you. How do you like, ""I can't believe this is my country"" or ""I am literally shaking""?Oh yes, I love those -- that looks great on me!This is why the snowflakes are smashing windows, beating up Trump supporters and calling for the assassination of Trump and the rape of his wife. If you've ever wondered how France's Reign of Terror happened, observe the anti-Trump protests -- the main result of which is to convince people who had misgivings about voting for Trump that they did the right thing.Trump is denounced for his alleged ""racism, homophobia, sexism, anti-Semitism, Islamaphobia!""No one stops to think: Wait a minute! These are all groups Trump has showered with affection, with the exception of Muslim immigrants -- who persecute the other four.This is the mob's muscle memory kicking in, as when Sen. Patty Murray reached for her mental file on ""Good Things a Leader Can Do"" and ended up praising Osama bin Laden after 9/11 for ""building day care facilities, building health care facilities."" The protesters are pulling out slogans from their ""Things We Pretend to Hate"" file.All this is the consequence of the Democratic Party's decision in the 1970s to get rid of all the normal people. Back when the party contained a large segment of the working class, there was a safety valve. They couldn't afford to be associated with airhead celebrities pushing insane ideas. Mayor Richard Daley, for example, did not travel to Cuba or brag about his friendship with Daniel Ortega.But then the head of the auto union had to be kicked out of the party because he was ""anti-choice.""Really? But he's been a Democrat for 18 years ... Well, maybe it's time we hear from the REST of America!Unfortunately, the rest of America wasn't large enough for Democrats to win elections. So they had to import Third World immigrants to vote for them.Trump's election is the Doomsday Scenario for Democrats because they were just on the verge of turning the whole country into California through mass immigration. Then they'd never have to think about those hicks in the icky parts of the country ever again. It would be so much better to be able to win elections by whipping up resentment toward white people.Last year, old lefty Bernie Sanders said mass immigration was a disaster for the working class, driving down their wages. He called open borders ""a Koch brothers idea.""Representing the modern, yuppified Democratic Party, the low-testosterone boys at Vox went nuts. Dylan Matthews sneeringly cited the many benefits of mass immigration -- to wit: cheap gardeners, maids and nannies. He also compared a pro-American immigration policy to the massacre of ""10,000 foreign civilians to save a single American life.""He didn't say it, but I got the distinct impression that Dylan was ""literally shaking.""SIGN UP"

(Should there have been a trigger warning in front of that sentence?) SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERHere are the top five in no particular order. Wait, strike that -- let's say one of the middle ones is the very top example of liberal lunacy, either Three or Four, take your pick, and the one listed first is the least important of the five, in order to keep the crazy theme going. Also, be prepared for ALL CAPS to erupt in the following post at any moment.1. Cry-Ins: They really did hold a ""cry-in"" at Cornell University. They got together and wept in the quad, sobbing about how ""terrifying"" Trump's victory was. They scrawled their heartbreak upon the pavement with colored chalk. There was shock and awwwww.Adults, presumably including some faculty members, appeared on the scene, but strangely none of them told the kids to grow up, which really should enrage the university's alumni and donors. The Wall Street Journal said school staff were ""providing tissues and hot chocolate"" to the emotional exhibitionists. It's not good at all when absurdly expensive institutions of higher learning churn out students who can't deal with the results of an election, and it is very much the fault of liberal-dominated academia that it's come to this. They did it on purpose, as part of the great liberal project to make childhood a permanent condition. It's also alarming that they invest so much of their personal value and spiritual energy into politics. One adult on the scene, who looked like a professor to the Cornell Sun's reporters, said the cry-in was ""an indication that there are many many people who are suffering and feel that haven't been heard and they believe that Trump will answer their needs."" If you're waiting for any politician to ""answer your needs,"" YOU'RE WHAT'S WRONG WITH AMERICA, KIDS. (I warned you about the caps.)Columnist Mark Steyn offered an interesting observation about the""special snowflake meltdown"": their ""knowledge of history is so scant that hitherto they had no idea America wasn't a one-party state and that once every decade or so the other guy gets to win."" That's funny, but it's also alarming. It's very unhealthy to not only assume political victories are permanent, but to become so convinced your ideology has a lock on power that you're emotionally incapable of dealing with the discovery you were wrong.2. Therapy Dogs: ""Pettable pooches"" were trotted out to schoolchildren in New York, as the New York Post reported. This is, once again, sending all the wrong signals about the nature of elections and responsible citizenship. Also, a letter from school administrators admitted that the faculty had backed Clinton, and ""our students brought a great deal of emotion, anxiety, and strong feelings"" to the election results. Are we allowed to ask how much of that load of emotion and anxiety was deposited in the minds of students by their political-activist teachers?Therapy dogs weren't just for small children. They were brought in to comfort university students and (more-or-less) grown-up Democratic staffers on Capitol Hill, too. At least some of them have the excuse that they may lose their jobs, because their bosses were defeated in the election. Then again, everyone who goes to work for an elected representative should be prepared for the possibility they won't be re-elected.3. Safety Pins: Safety pins swiftly became the new badge of aggrieved loser status, accompanied by the kind of social-media hashtag campaign the Obama Administration would occasionally substitute for foreign policy.Safety pins are supposed to identify the wearer as an island of safety and tolerance for ""women, LGBT people, immigrants, and people of color feeling frightened by Trump's presidency and vitriol that some of his supporters display,"" as New York Magazine put it.That's good to know, because singer Lady Gaga assures us women are ""fighting for their lives"" after Trump's electoral victory. Now they know they can run to the nearest safety pin when the Trumpian death squads come for them. (Note: expecting a man wearing a safety pin to protect you from an actual physical menace is probably unwise. Far better to look for an NRA pin, ladies.)The safety pin is perhaps the ultimate example of ""virtue signaling,"" the Left's passive-agressive technique of adopting political postures to signal personal virtue, while accusing everyone else of moral inferiority. In case you safety pinheads haven't noticed, it isn't Trump supporters that have been staging violent riots or issuing threats to rape the new First Lady. (On the other hand, it might be unfair to call the rioters ""Clinton voters,"" since it turns out most of the ringleaders didn't bother to vote at all.)Quick question: how many times do you have to Tweet under the #RapeMelania hashtag before you're not allowed to wear a safety pin any more?The safety pin is a shiny little incarnation of the Left's ridiculous binary political argument--you either support them 100%, or you're an intolerant monster who wants the oppressed to drop dead. IT'S NOT WORKING, KIDS. Normal people don't wish to attempt enlightened discourse with people who think dissent is immoral.4. Open Letters: The first wave of post-election open letters were, appropriately, addressed to children, but Hollywood's Jeffrey Katzenberg at least managed to write one without using grade school kids as props. It's still dripping with the sort of condescension that got liberals creamed in 2016 (""During the election, Donald Trump found facts inconvenient. But facts are very useful things."") However, Katzenberg acknowledged that Trump has been ""gracious in victory,"" and asked his fellow Democrats to consider showing a little grace themselves (""Throwing down the bat and leaving the park is not an option."")Self-awareness has its limits, as Katzenberg spends a great deal of time railing against ""demagogues,"" without noticing that his political leaders haven't said much to stop the political violence from anti-Trump forces. He also continues the Hollywood Left's effort to claim the mantle of ""tolerance"" and free speech, which will sound hilarious to any Hollywood conservative.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo wrote an open letter declaring the election to be a ""heartbreaking and bewildering and indeed frightening"" experience, haunted by ""the voices of the Ku Klux Klan, white nationalism, authoritarianism, misogyny and xenophobia,"" not to mention ""a generally disdainful view of American ideals.""The most infamous open letter was probably the one GrubHub CEO Matt Maloney wrote to his employees, demanding the resignation of anyone who agreed with the ""nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics of Donald Trump."" Maloney is now furiously scribbling open letters that insist his previous open letter didn't say what it plainly said.Many of these open letters are another form of virtue-signaling, and a standing accusation against non-left-wing America for things it hasn't actually done. Also, there's a consistent undercurrent of rationalization for Hillary Clinton's defeat, a recurring theme that she was robbed of deserved victory by an opponent who played foul. Why, we could ""fix"" democracy if only people with unacceptable political views were stripped of the right to vote!5. Clinton Victory Fantasies: A few distraught lefties have floated outright assassination fantasies or implied threats of insurrection, but most of them are smart enough to stay away from rhetoric that could get them investigated by the Secret Service.Much more stylish are the flights of fancy that the electoral system can be torn down and rebuilt to liberal tastes. Wild fantasies of a dramatic eleventh-hour reversal that bars Trump from the White House have become op-ed safety blankets. A full-blown temper tantrum against the Electoral College is currently in progress, with overtones of how the Left decided midterm elections were archaic nonsense after they got crushed in 2010 and 2014. The favored nook-nook of the hour for emotionally devastated liberals is a meaningless petition to sweep the Electoral College aside right now and install Hillary Clinton as President, based on popular vote totals. Before that, some liberals suckled on complaints that FBI Director James Comey TOTALLY STOLE THE ELECTION FROM CLINTON, but that one seems to have died out quickly. Democrats spent the last few days before the election praising Comey as Captain America because he re-closed the email server investigation without changing his position on indictments. Turning him back into the Red Skull is a bit too much whiplash for even the more mentally flexible liberals. (Also, they might find themselves agreeing with people on the Right who were critical of Comey's conduct every step of the way, and we can't have that.)Looking ahead, the next liberal craze will be insisting that President Trump HAS NO MANDATE and cannot govern in any way, at least not without the unanimous approval of the few remaining Democrats in high public office. Republicans usually fall for that sort of thing, but this one probably won't. Liberals will resort to ever more deranged acts of political exhibitionism to reinforce their sense of superiority, sow fear among the populace, and win media attention away from the first Republican in ages who can consistently steal their spotlight. Strap in (or tighten your straitjacket buckles, as the case may be) for a wild ride.SIGN UPThe Left has packed an awful lot of crazy into the days since Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the presidential election.

It's not good at all when absurdly expensive institutions of higher learning churn out students who can't deal with the results of an election, and it is very much the fault of liberal-dominated academia that it's come to this. They did it on purpose, as part of the great liberal project to make childhood a permanent condition. It's also alarming that they invest so much of their personal value and spiritual energy into politics. One adult on the scene, who looked like a professor to the Cornell Sun's reporters, said the cry-in was ""an indication that there are many many people who are suffering and feel that haven't been heard and they believe that Trump will answer their needs."" If you're waiting for any politician to ""answer your needs,"" YOU'RE WHAT'S WRONG WITH AMERICA, KIDS. (I warned you about the caps.)Columnist Mark Steyn offered an interesting observation about the""special snowflake meltdown"": their ""knowledge of history is so scant that hitherto they had no idea America wasn't a one-party state and that once every decade or so the other guy gets to win."" That's funny, but it's also alarming. It's very unhealthy to not only assume political victories are permanent, but to become so convinced your ideology has a lock on power that you're emotionally incapable of dealing with the discovery you were wrong.""Pettable pooches"" were trotted out to schoolchildren in New York, as the New York Postreported. This is, once again, sending all the wrong signals about the nature of elections and responsible citizenship. Also, a letter from school administrators admitted that the faculty had backed Clinton, and ""our students brought a great deal of emotion, anxiety, and strong feelings"" to the election results. Are we allowed to ask how much of that load of emotion and anxiety was deposited in the minds of students by their political-activist teachers?Therapy dogs weren't just for small children. They were brought in to comfort university students and (more-or-less) grown-up Democratic staffers on Capitol Hill, too. At least some of them have the excuse that they may lose their jobs, because their bosses were defeated in the election. Then again, everyone who goes to work for an elected representative should be prepared for the possibility they won't be re-elected.Safety pins swiftly became the new badge of aggrieved loser status, accompanied by the kind of social-media hashtag campaign the Obama Administration would occasionally substitute for foreign policy.Safety pins are supposed to identify the wearer as an island of safety and tolerance for ""women, LGBT people, immigrants, and people of color feeling frightened by Trump's presidency and vitriol that some of his supporters display,"" as New York Magazine put it.That's good to know, because singer Lady Gaga assures us women are ""fighting for their lives"" after Trump's electoral victory. Now they know they can run to the nearest safety pin when the Trumpian death squads come for them. (Note: expecting a man wearing a safety pin to protect you from an actual physical menace is probably unwise. Far better to look for an NRA pin, ladies.)The safety pin is perhaps the ultimate example of ""virtue signaling,"" the Left's passive-agressive technique of adopting political postures to signal personal virtue, while accusing everyone else of moral inferiority. In case you safety pinheads haven't noticed, it isn't Trump supporters that have been staging violent riots or issuing threats to rape the new First Lady. (On the other hand, it might be unfair to call the rioters ""Clinton voters,"" since it turns out most of the ringleaders didn't bother to vote at all.)Quick question: how many times do you have to Tweet under the #RapeMelania hashtag before you're not allowed to wear a safety pin any more?The safety pin is a shiny little incarnation of the Left's ridiculous binary political argument--you either support them 100%, or you're an intolerant monster who wants the oppressed to drop dead. IT'S NOT WORKING, KIDS. Normal people don't wish to attempt enlightened discourse with people who think dissent is immoral.The first wave of post-election open letters were, appropriately, addressed to children, but Hollywood's Jeffrey Katzenberg at least managed to write one without using grade school kids as props. It's still dripping with the sort of condescension that got liberals creamed in 2016 (""During the election, Donald Trump found facts inconvenient. But facts are very useful things."") However, Katzenberg acknowledged that Trump has been ""gracious in victory,"" and asked his fellow Democrats to consider showing a little grace themselves (""Throwing down the bat and leaving the park is not an option."")Self-awareness has its limits, as Katzenberg spends a great deal of time railing against ""demagogues,"" without noticing that his political leaders haven't said much to stop the political violence from anti-Trump forces. He also continues the Hollywood Left's effort to claim the mantle of ""tolerance"" and free speech, which will sound hilarious to any Hollywood conservative.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo wrote an open letter declaring the election to be a ""heartbreaking and bewildering and indeed frightening"" experience, haunted by ""the voices of the Ku Klux Klan, white nationalism, authoritarianism, misogyny and xenophobia,"" not to mention ""a generally disdainful view of American ideals.""The most infamous open letter was probably the one GrubHub CEO Matt Maloney wrote to his employees, demanding the resignation of anyone who agreed with the ""nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics of Donald Trump."" Maloney is now furiously scribbling open letters that insist his previous open letter didn't say what it plainly said.Many of these open letters are another form of virtue-signaling, and a standing accusation against non-left-wing America for things it hasn't actually done. Also, there's a consistent undercurrent of rationalization for Hillary Clinton's defeat, a recurring theme that she was robbed of deserved victory by an opponent who played foul. Why, we could ""fix"" democracy if only people with unacceptable political views were stripped of the right to vote!A few distraught lefties have floated outright assassination fantasies or implied threats of insurrection, but most of them are smart enough to stay away from rhetoric that could get them investigated by the Secret Service.Much more stylish are the flights of fancy that the electoral system can be torn down and rebuilt to liberal tastes. Wild fantasies of a dramatic eleventh-hour reversal that bars Trump from the White House have become op-ed safety blankets. A full-blown temper tantrum against the Electoral College is currently in progress, with overtones of how the Left decided midterm elections were archaic nonsense after they got crushed in 2010 and 2014. The favored nook-nook of the hour for emotionally devastated liberals is a meaningless petition to sweep the Electoral College aside right now and install Hillary Clinton as President, based on popular vote totals. Before that, some liberals suckled on complaints that FBI Director James Comey TOTALLY STOLE THE ELECTION FROM CLINTON, but that one seems to have died out quickly. Democrats spent the last few days before the election praising Comey as Captain America because he re-closed the email server investigation without changing his position on indictments. Turning him back into the Red Skull is a bit too much whiplash for even the more mentally flexible liberals. (Also, they might find themselves agreeing with people on the Right who were critical of Comey's conduct every step of the way, and we can't have that.)Looking ahead, the next liberal craze will be insisting that President Trump HAS NO MANDATE and cannot govern in any way, at least not without the unanimous approval of the few remaining Democrats in high public office. Republicans usually fall for that sort of thing, but this one probably won't. Liberals will resort to ever more deranged acts of political exhibitionism to reinforce their sense of superiority, sow fear among the populace, and win media attention away from the first Republican in ages who can consistently steal their spotlight. Strap in (or tighten your straitjacket buckles, as the case may be) for a wild ride."

The ID does not contain a photo, so SCI is recommending the ID be changed to include a photo or that two forms of ID be required to purchase bullets.SCI said that digitized firearm purchase records could be harvested into a database and reviewed to look for signs of trouble or to determine if one person was buying too many rounds of ammunition, stating, ""By plugging into a searchable database, police could determine if there were links between criminal activity and recent ammunition purchases. Further, the database could be used to 'red flag' excessive ammunition purchases.""The  Association of New Jersey Rifle and Pistol Clubs' Scott Bach responded to SCI's recommendations by labeling them ""a solution in search of a problem."" He said they ""are based on the false and naive premise that criminals use ID cards to purchase ammunition in the first place"" and said ""putting a photo on a card used only by law-abiding citizens will neither disrupt illegal trafficking nor make anyone safer.""A bill to require a photo on a state-issued firearms card is currently in the legislature.

19	http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/11/16/donald-trump-can-make-good-pledge-end-common-core/	Donald Trump Can Make Good on His Pledge To End Common Core	"Donald Trump's pledge to parents that he would end the controversial Common Core standards and finally get Washington, D.C. out of education is ready to be tested.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERWhile on the campaign trail, the president-elect described Common Core as a ""disaster,"" and said that the federal government should leave education to states and local school districts. Some of the names on what has been released as Trump's short list of candidates for education secretary, however, are troublesome to grassroots parent activists and others fighting to bring education choices back to the states and localities - where the Constitution says those decisions belong.""Some of the names being floated as possible Secretary of Education are troubling,"" explains Jane Robbins, education fellow at American Principles Project. ""Trump's most consistent education-related commitment during the campaign was to end Common Core and restore local control, and that won't happen if the Department of Education is run by someone who has supported or protected Common Core in the past.""The list of possible candidates includes many Common Core supporters as well as those who backed former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush - a champion of the unpopular standards:""Mr. Trump needs to listen to the grassroots forces who are relying on him to restore local autonomy in education,"" Robbins says.Heartland Institute education fellow Joy Pullmann tells Breitbart News there is much Trump can do to make good on his pledge to end Common Core.""Unlike the media, which insisted on explaining Trump's statements hyperliterally, Trump's voters heard their candidate tell them he's with us in opposition to running the nation's schools from Washington D.C., she explains. ""That's what it means to oppose Common Core. As president, Trump can do a lot to fulfill this promise.""Pullmann continues:For example, under both parties for decades, the federal government has funded and graded states' curriculum mandates and tests, a mechanism that greased the skids for Common Core and has kept them greased for Common Core's inevitable successor. With Congress, Trump can and should end this practice. In keeping with federal law, the federal government should have nothing whatsoever to do with funding or evaluating curriculum and tests. It should all be given back to the states and their people.Pullmann also points to Trump's pledge to get Washington out of education policy. President Jimmy Carter instituted the U.S. Department of Education in 1979.""The U.S. Department of Education needs to be drastically right-sized,"" she says, adding:Its power over state education bureaucrats is another factor that greased the skids for Common Core. Congress should write and President Trump should sign a new law cutting the department down to a mere auditor's office that no longer employs bureaucrats who tell us what children should learn, when, and how. Instead, the department should send states their own money and power back and let we, the people decide how to run our own affairs, as Trump also promised in his acceptance speech would characterize his presidency.The Common Core is a federally promoted education initiative introduced in the Obama administration's 2009 stimulus bill through a competitive grant program called Race to the Top (RttT). States could apply and compete for federal grant money and waivers from federal regulations as long as they adopted a set of uniform standards and aligned curricula, agreed to a massive system of student data collection, and signed onto a teacher evaluation system that would be based in part on student performance on assessments aligned with the standards.The standards were developed by three private organizations in Washington D.C.: the National Governors Association (NGA), the Council for Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), and progressive education company Achieve Inc. All three organizations were privately funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and none of these groups are accountable to parents, teachers, students, or taxpayers.Eventually, 46 states signed onto the unproven Common Core standards with little, if any, public or media scrutiny, and most of them prior to their state boards of education even seeing the standards themselves.Parent activist groups have met with substantial resistance from both Republican and Democrat governors and state legislators in their quest to repeal Common Core in the states. Political pressure from big business groups, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce - a major supporter of Common Core - and the threat of having federal funds pulled from their states, led most state lawmakers and governors to dismiss parental concerns.The 2016 annual Education Next poll shows that public support for the Common Core State Standards has fallen to a record low.According to the survey, support for the Common Core education plan dropped to 50 percent this year, down from 58 percent in 2015 and from 83 percent in 2013.The poll finds that, among teachers, support for the program has dropped from 87 percent in 2013, to 54 percent in 2014, to 44 percent in 2015, and continuing at that level in 2016.In addition, since 2011, state membership in the two federally funded consortia developed to create Common Core-aligned tests has dropped by 62 percent.A recent report by ACT - the nonprofit that developed the college admissions and placement test administered to more than 1.8 million high school graduates annually - found that only 16 percent of college professors said their incoming students were well prepared overall for college-level work, down from 26 percent in 2009 and 2012, a stunning outcome considering Common Core proponents' primary selling point for the standards has been that they will make U.S. students ""college and career ready.""Pullmann herself also reported in January at The Federalist that Common Core is estimated to have cost the nation as a whole $80 billion, in addition to the costs to individual states that have seen the tab for the education reform skyrocket.""The way to end Common Core is to end the superstructures that made it not just possible but inevitable,"" she says. ""Even though Common Core is technically off-limits for federal influence, its successors will soon arise, and they will be worse than Common Core-unless President Trump fulfills his promise to his voters to end Common Core once and for all.""""He can do this by defunding the education establishment taxpayers currently pay to oppress us, and sending states' education dollars back to them for parents and local voters to manage themselves,"" she explains. ""Common Core is a hydra that consumes federal education dollars. The only way to kill it for good is to stop feeding it. Give us our own money and power back, and Common Core will never happen again.""In addition, Pullmann observes that Trump can strike a mortal blow to another major lever in the massive Common Core boondoggle - student data collection.""Trump can put a stake into Common Core by killing the national student information databases the U.S. Department of Education has been paying states to construct in violation of laws forbidding a national surveillance system,"" she states. ""It interacts with Common Core and expands its reach from birth through a person's career.""Writing at Cato, education director Neal McCluskey agrees that while the federal incentive levers to the states - Race to the Top and No Child Left Behind waivers - are no longer in operation, Trump and a Republican Congress can ensure the regulations associated with the new massive education law, the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), don't ""coerce the use of the Core or any other specific standards or tests.""In a press release following the House's passage of ESSA, potential Trump education secretary candidate Rep. Messer described the bill, as ""a new approach to the federal role in education. It gives power over education back to the people we trust-- local administrators, teachers and parents who are best-positioned to make decisions for our students.""Robbins, however, writing at The Pulse 2016, observed, ""ESSA lays out particular requirements for state standards and uses code language throughout that gives the federal government the tools to pressure the states to stick with Common Core rather than risking their federal money by adopting something better.""""It maintains the federally dictated testing regimen and requires states to implement assessments that are expensive, that have been proven to be ineffective and unworkable, and that operate not by assessing students' academic knowledge but rather by measuring their attitudes and dispositions,"" she concluded.""This has been a real concern,"" McCluskey explains. ""While the spirit and rhetoric surrounding the ESSA is about breaking down federal strictures, the Obama education department has been drafting regulations that threaten federal control over funding formulas and accountability systems. And the statute includes language vague enough that it could allow federal control by education secretary veto.""""A Trump administration would likely avoid that,"" he says, and notes as well that Trump's supporters ""don't seem inclined to do what Beltway types tell them.""For example, under both parties for decades, the federal government has funded and graded states' curriculum mandates and tests, a mechanism that greased the skids for Common Core and has kept them greased for Common Core's inevitable successor. With Congress, Trump can and should end this practice. In keeping with federal law, the federal government should have nothing whatsoever to do with funding or evaluating curriculum and tests. It should all be given back to the states and their people.Its power over state education bureaucrats is another factor that greased the skids for Common Core.

My efforts began in New Mexico, where the organizations I lead are based, and expanded to focus on national issues. When I accepted the executive director position on January 1, 2007, New Mexico had an anti-energy governor and America had a pro-energy president. Two years later that flipped. By then, I'd become deeply committed to what I began to call the ""energy makes America great!"" message.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThrough my work, I quickly learned about the important role that energy plays in America's economic prosperity and growth. Because I didn't know a lot about energy before taking the position, I understood how little the average person thinks about energy--until their power goes out or gasoline prices spike. I believe that if people better understand the role of energy in their lives, they'd make wiser choices when they vote. I have been passionate about the cause.The election of Donald Trump as our 45th president is a vindication of my work as one of his big campaign messages was about America's abundant resources and his promise to manage and maximize them--rather than to lock them up.While I have worked these past ten years to educate people and keep a positive energy message in the public dialog, during the past several months I have specifically engaged in doing everything I could to be sure our next president was pro-energy. I don't have the reach of a Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, or Sean Hannity--or even Ann Coulter, Laura Ingram, or Michelle Malkin. But I do have a platform. My weekly column is widely distributed. I typically do dozens of radio interviews each month. And, I've frequently spoken for many industry, political, and civic organizations.Because most of my time as executive director was during the Obama years, I've fought for the Keystone pipeline and against the many punitive regulations that stem from the green agenda--most specifically the Clean Power Plan that is the cornerstone of Obama's climate change agenda.The recent news cycle has been so myopically focused on the presidential election, I suspect few people are even aware of the U.N. climate change meeting going on right now, November 7-18, in Morocco. There green campaigners and policymakers are meeting for talks on implementing the Paris climate agreement. Imagine their shock when they realized that Trump will be our next president. He's made canceling Obama's commitment and ending the billions of climate change payments to the U.N. a key part of his stump speech. On November 9, Bloomberg wrote: ""Doubts about U.S. support for the accord could stall progress in talks in Morocco this week and next, since other nations wouldn't trust that any commitments the U.S. made will stick after Trump takes office.""Truly, getting the entire globe onboard for the plan that would raise energy costs, hurt the poor, and lower living standards was always doubtful. Just last week, China, which gave lip-service to the agreement, announced that it will raise coal power capacity by as much as 20% by 2020--this, despite its climate pledge. Last month news came out of France that it will drop plans for a carbon tax--which was expected to kickstart broader European action to cut emissions and drive forward the international climate accord. But now, under a Trump presidency, the Paris climate agreement's entire future is doubtful.Trump will kill the Clean Power Plan and other key climate policies. Coal-fueled power plants that were slated for closure can now achieve their full life expectancy and continue to provide communities with cost-effective electricity. He'll approve the Keystone pipeline and improve drilling access on federal lands. He'll roll back regulations and diminish the Environmental Protection Agency's authority. Wind and solar companies already realize their days of feeding at the government trough are over--immediately following Trump's victory announcement stock in the world's largest wind turbine manufacturer ""plunged.""Trump's energy policies are my energy policies. Mission accomplished.Thank you to the thousands of individuals and companies, from coast-to-coast, who have supported this work through notes of encouragement, membership in the Citizens' Alliance for Responsible Energy, and financial contributions. Contrary to what those who send me nasty notes might believe, I do not think the Koch brothers or ExxonMobil even know I exist.I have used what I call a Field-of-Dreams fundraising model: ""If you build it, they will come."" This has mostly worked throughout my ten years at the helm. I'd send out fundraising letters and those who believed in my work sent checks--with an annual average of $500 each. But then came the downturn in oil prices and coal company bankruptcies--and the accompanying job losses. Suddenly, the pool of people who'd written checks, and could continue to do so, got smaller. Likewise, the types of events where I've been a popular presenter, no longer have a budget for speakers.Nearly a year ago, I had to discontinue the services of the DC-based PR firm I'd used to successfully schedule all those interviews. During 2016, there's only sporadically been enough in the checking account to cover my salary. Because I believed so strongly in the ""energy makes America great!"" message, I've continued without pay--hoping my efforts would impact the election.I hope you agree, they did. Now, my work here is finished.

The plaintiffs want transparency from the federal government and environmentally informed decision-making.The nine plaintiffs urge that communities have been harmed and overwhelmed by school overcrowding, traffic congestion, water and air pollution, destruction of property and livestock, loss of green space, and interference with the peaceful enjoyment of private property. There were 14 affidavits attached to the complaint by those harmed by the federal government's policies.Affiant Don Rosenberg's 25-year-old son Drew was in his second year of law school when an unlicensed illegal-alien driver ran over him three times and killed him. Rosenberg's affidavit, an exhibit to the lawsuit, notes the stresses caused by congested areas, including traffic tie-ups and congestion, and says that the growing population in southern California has meant that there is not enough water to sustain the population. Rosenberg has lived in southern California for 30 years and he says he supports the lawsuit because DHS failed to take into account the environmental impacts of its mass immigration policies. Rosenberg maintains a website explaining the horrific things his family went through after his son was murdered by an illegal alien.The plaintiffs, who are represented by the Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI), want DHS to be transparent to the public and report ""all potential impacts of the action.""Lead IRLI counsel, Julie Axelrod told Breitbart Texas, ""The federal government has been ignoring our nation's preeminent environmental law for the past 46 years. NEPA, which stated directly that endless population growth is not in the national interest, was supposed to prevent exactly what has happened-- that the public is in the dark about the massive environmental impact of the policy choices of their government.""Axelrod explains, ""In 2015, there was one new immigrant for every two births in the United States-- which means a huge amount of population growth is entirely due to government policy. But DHS has never done any analysis of the environmental impact of deluge added to deluge of people. How can DHS imagine they have no environmental effect? The government recognizes that if it builds a new road or a new school it has an environmental impact--but why does it think new roads or schools, or other structures are built in the first place, if not to serve the needs of the population?""The nine plaintiffs include: Californians for Population Stabilization, Arizona Association of Conservation Districts, Floridians for Sustainable Population, Scientists and Environmentalists for Population Stabilization, New Mexico Cattlegrowers Association, Floridians for Sustainable Population,Whitewater Draw Natural Resource Conservation District, the Hereford Natural Resource Conservation District, Glen Colton, and Ralph Pope.The plaintiffs charge that the DHS has closed its eyes to the environmental effects of immigration and has ignored federal law that governs the issue. They point to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and urge that federal law requires any federal agency to take a ""hard look"" at every ""major federal action."" They urge that the U.S. government must consider any action that will affect the environment, and to both analyze and publicize those effects.They seek to force DHS to contemplate the ""enormous impacts to the human environment caused by legal and illegal immigration.""Ian Smith, a spokesman for the Immigration Reform Law Institute told Breitbart Texas:The Left has always been vocal about American consumption rates, i.e., that one fifth of the world's oil is consumed in America, while its share of the population is only five percent. But they say nothing about the U.S. being easily the number one importer of people on the planet. Indeed, America's population growth rate is comparable to that of the Third World. Currently, over 10 percent of all the people born in Mexico are living in the U.S., all of whom now consume like Americans. It is estimated that the carbon footprint of the average immigrant is four times higher than it would have been had they remained at home. America's high population growth and high consumption means we have an outsized impact on the world's environmental systems. Quite simply, reducing immigration is the best way to reduce our carbon footprint on the planet.Smith says much of the immigration-control movement was actually founded and supported by environmentalists. He points to Obama's chief science adviser, John Holdren, who he says was a staunch restrictionist in the 1970s, and other notable public environmentalists like Nelson Rockefeller, Gaylord Nelson, and Population Bomb-author Paul R. Ehrlich.""Even bellwether environmental groups like the Sierra Club understood the harmful effects of unregulated immigration. The Sierra Club flipped in the mid-nineties after they got a $100-million dollar check from a hedge fund manager who didn't like their immigration angle,"" Smith urges. ""Now they won't even share a platform with environmentally-focused restrictionist groups.""The IRLI highlights the Census Bureau and says that half of all urban sprawl is a result of population growth. They note a report by the Center for Immigration Studies and say that 80 percent of the population growth is attributed to immigration. They also say that between 1990 and 2010, the population in the United States grew by over 61 million people and this can be attributed to the wide immigration policies and soft immigration enforcement of DHS and the INS before it. The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (""INS"") was the predecessor to the DHS.It is projected that the population of the U.S. will grow from 321.37 million (2015 figures), to 407.41 million in 2055.Former Colorado Democratic Governor Richard D. Lamm told Breitbart Texas, ""Americans have a right to know the environmental impacts of our government's mass immigration policies, especially when half of all immigrants go to just five metropolitan areas in the country: New York, Chicago, San Francisco-Oakland, Los Angeles and Southern Florida. It's no coincidence that the latter two sprawl-centers contain the largest number of species now on America's endangered list.""Lamm, an affiant in the lawsuit, now serves as the co-director of the Institute for Public Policy Studies at the University of Denver in Colorado. He is the author of the book ""Population and the Law.""Lana Shadwick is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas. She has served as a prosecutor and associate judge in Texas.

28	http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/11/16/democrats-pick-chuck-schumer-become-senate-minority-leader/	Democrats Pick Chuck Schumer to Become Senate Minority Leader	"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans re-elected Mitch McConnell of Kentucky on Wednesday to be majority leader next year, keeping the respected legislative tactician at the forefront when the new Congress begins working on Donald Trump's agenda.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe chamber's Democrats replaced their departing leader with Sen. Chuck Schumer, meaning the New Yorker will be Washington's most powerful Democrat as the party confronts a Republican-dominated government.McConnell is widely popular among his GOP colleagues and his selection was never in doubt. The 74-year-old has a genteel manner but has proven to be a coolly effective leader, steering his party through a long battle over a Supreme Court vacancy and the stormy - though ultimately successful - presidential candidacy of Trump.McConnell and Schumer were both elected unanimously at separate closed-door meetings.McConnell was Senate minority leader for eight years before becoming majority leader when the GOP took control in 2015.He's pushed a conservative agenda while cutting budget deals with President Barack Obama. And he enraged Democrats by refusing to let the Senate consider Obama's nomination of federal judge Merrick Garland to fill a Supreme Court vacancy that occurred last February. That move paid dividends when Trump was elected.McConnell distanced himself from Trump during the campaign, at times flatly refusing to discuss the race with reporters. But he says he's ready to work with him.Schumer, 65, will replace the retiring minority leader, Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada. Schumer has been No. 3 Democratic leader and vaulted over No. 2 leader Dick Durbin of Illinois, who will remain in that slot.Schumer will lead Democrats' last line of defense against the Trump White House and GOP-controlled House. Senate Democrats - outnumbered 52-48, including two independents who back Democrats - could prevent McConnell from getting the 60 votes he'll need on some important issues.It won't always be possible for Schumer to keep Senate Democrats together because many of them will seek re-election in two years from GOP-leaning states.Schumer has said he'll seek opportunities to work with Trump but will face pressure from disappointed Democratic activists to adopt a hard line. It's unclear how he'll balance the demands of progressive Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., against red-state senators facing re-election in 2018 and needing protection from politically damaging votes.Schumer has a history of being a savvy partisan combatant willing to strike compromises, such as on a 2013 bipartisan immigration overhaul that ended up dying.The lack of drama as senators chose their leaders was the opposite of the House, where both parties' leadership elections have been more theatrical.There, Republicans voted Tuesday to re-nominate Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., after recalcitrant conservatives and Trump backers upset by Ryan's frigid campaign-season treatment of Trump fell into line.House Democrats postponed their leadership election until Nov. 30 after junior lawmakers demanded more time to digest the party's disappointing Election Day showing, a warning shot at House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.On Tuesday, House Republicans re-nominated Ryan by unanimous voice vote.Ryan will need 218 votes - a majority - to be approved when the full, new House convenes Jan. 3. With the GOP on target to have 241 seats next year, Ryan can afford just 23 defectors, but many Republicans expect Ryan to be safe in the GOP afterglow of Trump's win.Aiding Ryan: Support from Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, which Ryan and others underscored to Republican lawmakers before they voted.""The momentum is with us,"" Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., said in an interview after nominating Ryan during Tuesday's closed-door meeting. ""The last thing we need is to distract attention right now with a leadership fight. We're all pulling in the same direction.""Mulvaney is in the tea party-leaning House Freedom Caucus, which has frequently rebelled against GOP leaders.Freedom Caucus leader Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said that while he expected Ryan to be elected speaker, ""we'll see what happens"" during the lame-duck session with Ryan's handling of spending bills and rules giving rank-and-file lawmakers more power.At a meeting of House Democrats Tuesday, Pelosi told her colleagues ""we've been through hell"" with the election and that Democrats should draw contrasts with Trump, according to an aide in the room.But all were not happy.""Everything's not good. Business as usual is not going to work,"" said Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., among those who pushed for the delayed leadership vote.SIGN UP"
