But it was never finalized.In June 2009 Tehran signed a nearly $5-billion agreement with CNPC for the development of that phase. That contract was also cancelled in early 2013, because the Chinese side didn't honor its commitments.The offshore South Pars field, shared by Iran and Qatar in the Gulf, contains some 14,000 billion cubic meters of gas -- 8 percent of the world's known reserves.SIGN UP	[]	[]

Analysis of early voting shows that the Reid turnout machine -- known for effectively using labor unions to bus people to the polls -- has built a significant lead for Democrats including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. For Trump to win, he'd need a big turnout from his supporters on Tuesday and he'd need Clinton to underperform with voting Democrats.As respected Nevada journalist Jon Ralston explained in Politico, the Reid machine has ""brought turnout among Hispanics in the state to record levels,"" a good sign for Clinton. Ralston shows how Hispanics have steadily increased their overall percentage of the Nevada vote.Reid's ground operation exploited the fear and loathing of Trump to the max, and the early results bear it out: Whereas the Latino vote was 15 percent of the Nevada electorate in 2008 and 18 percent in 2012, data I have seen shows now it is up 30 percent from 2012 in early voting, meaning it could go above 20 percent of all voters by Tuesday evening.Ralston has earned his moniker as the ""Oracle of Nevada"" with accurate predictions in previous Nevada elections. In 2010 he picked against the polls and correctly predicted Reid's victory over Sharron Angle. He accurately predicted Nevada would pick Democrat President Obama in the presidential election but narrowly elect Republican Dean Heller to the Senate in 2012. In 2016, Ralston is confidently predicting a ""blue wave"" for Democrats in Nevada.It's that time of year: My predictions for NV on Tuesday. I see a blue wave coming. https://t.co/keG4gDQbBD-- Jon Ralston (@RalstonReports) November 6, 2016Early voting numbers released by the Nevada Secretary of State paint a bleak picture for Trump. Democrats have already cast more than 70,000 votes in Clark County where more than two-thirds of Nevada's population lives. Democrats even have a narrow margin in Nevada's second largest county, Washoe. The early voting margins between Trump and Hillary mirror the presidential election in 2012 when President Obama beat Mitt Romney by seven points. While the early voting returns paint a bleak picture, several other factors could make the presidential race for Nevada competitive.Donald Trump has maintained a slight but consistent lead in Nevada polling. The Real Clear Politics average shows Trump with a two-point lead over Clinton. Two recent polls show momentum for Trump expanding his lead to four-points and five-points respectively.Another factor that could play well for Trump is the bitter divide opened up during the Democrat primary between Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. The primary fight culminated at the Democrat State convention where Sanders supporters claim the Democrat establishment colluded to rob Bernie of a win in the caucus by revoking the credentials of Bernie delegates in a shady procedural vote. For Trump to claim Nevada, he needs to outperform Mitt Romney in 2012 with Democrats and Independents and NeverHillary Democrats will not be able to vote for Green Party candidate Jill Stein, who does not appear on the Nevada ballot. Even some delegates for Bernie are reportedly voting for Trump.Former Nevada state convention Sanders delegate @sivadavi8 tells me she voted for Trump, would have voted Stein but she's not on the ballot.-- Michael Tracey (@mtracey) November 5, 2016I guess defaming people and screwing them over, as was done to the Nevada Sanders delegates, has electoral consequences. Who knew?-- Michael Tracey (@mtracey) November 6, 2016For Trump to win in Nevada he will not only have to overcome Reid's political machine, he will have to overcome opposition from the Senate candidate in his own party. Republican Joe Heck and Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto are competing for the Senate seat vacated by Reid. Heck is slightly underperforming Trump in the Real Clear Politics average of polls with just a 1.4-point advantage. Heck was booed and jeered after rescinding his endorsement of Trump shortly after the release of the Access Hollywood tape showing Trump making lewd comments more than a decade ago.The Trump campaign needs every vote in Nevada to deliver six electoral votes that could prove crucial in the race for the White House. If the Trump movement delivers a victory in Nevada, they will have defeated one of the most formidable political machines in American history and the establishment of their own party.Dustin Stockton is a political reporter for Breitbart News, a community liaison for Gun Owners of America, and a political strategist.

7	7	http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/11/07/transportation-regulators-are-off-the-rails-again/	Transportation Regulators Are off the Rails, Again	"One positive of this election season is the wealth of discussion of America's regulatory environment and the drag it puts on the economy.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBut how does this work exactly? How do regulations drive up costs? What exactly does this look like?It looks a lot like what's going on in the railroad industry right now. The Surface Transportation Board, which governs rail traffic, wants to make it easier for big shippers to force private railroads to switch trains to tracks owned by other railroads to accommodate delivery.Today, shippers and railroads negotiate these settlements all the time. Railroads try to limit what is known as reciprocal switching because it is expensive, time- and manpower-intensive and throws off schedules. But they make deals where they must because it is, in fact, reciprocal - they all occasionally need the favor returned.The current regulation, developed as part of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, empowers the Surface Transportation Board to force railroads to accept reciprocal switching, but only if shippers can prove anticompetitive behavior by the railroads.Powerful shippers, organized as the National Industrial Transportation Freight League, have sought for years to change this, and they've finally found a regulator they can bully. The proposal, first offered by the shippers five years ago, drops the language about proving anticompetitive behavior and instead requires only that the change requested by practicable and in the public interest and necessary to provide competitive rail service.That lower standard would mean $7.8 billion in additional expenses for the railroads and could wipe out as much as 80 percent of the railroads' budget for track and equipment updates.The shippers group argues the change would create competition by forcing railroads to make the switch at already-used interchanges. But this also is where traffic is heaviest and potential for delays greatest, and it could be dozens or even hundreds of miles out of the way - all expenses borne by the railroad.The group further says the current rules are ""a formidable barrier to any U.S. business whose facility is served by only one railroad from obtaining competitive rail service through an agency-approved competitive switch.""But the current rule has been in place more than 30 years, and not a single shipper has proven railroads have engaged in anticompetitive behavior, and few have even tried.Moreover, as Marc Scribner, transportation analyst at the free market Competitive Enterprise Institute (where this writer used to work) described in a coalition letter signed by more than a dozen policy groups, railroad deregulation under the Staggers Act ""represents one of the most significant economic policy successes in in the history of the United States.""The industry was over-regulated and flat on its back in the late-1970s, Scribner said. The last passenger line serving the East Coast had gone broke, replaced by an even less-efficient government operation - Amtrak. Freight traffic in the East had been loaded onto Conrail, another government entity, and the future of the industry looked bleak and government-owned.But thanks to the Staggers Act, railroads rebounded. Major U.S. railroads in 2014 supported 1.5 million jobs, $274 billion in annual economic activity, nearly $90 billion in wages and $33 billion in tax revenues.Even though Inflation-adjusted freight rates overall are down more than 40 percent since 1980, the industry still has managed to sink $25 billion into its own infrastructure improvements in recent years and more than $600 billion since 1980.But big shippers, such as chemical companies, agricultural products producers and others have gotten the ear of the Surface Transportation Board. They seek not a better deal but a better price, and they want government to force it.Shippers argue consolidation within the industry - four railroads carry 90 percent of America's freight traffic - make it tough to force the kind of deal-making that leads to lower prices.But UPS, which ships 3,000 trailers and containers by rail every day, says the railroads are right, and this new rule would create chaos in the industry. ""A new reciprocal switching scheme will lead to decreased network velocity, diminished capital investments into the freight rail network, and deteriorating rail intermodal service levels,"" the company wrote in a letter to the regulators.The rest of the shipping group's argument, as explained in an article by its leader, amounts to ""because it's our time.""Today's railroads ""bear no resemblance to the companies that endured smother federal regulation prior to 1980,"" the article read. Deregulation was ""the right medicine for an ailing industry,"" but the railroads of today are ""doing quite well.""Americans would not ""accept a regulatory regime for our telecommunications industry based on rules written for 'Ma Bell' as it existed in the 1970s"" and ""neither should we accept rules written to protect the bankrupt rail industry of that same period.""Let that sink in. The rules that enabled the railroad industry to rise from the near-dead and rebuild itself as a vital link in modern multimodal shipping should be replaced by the kind of industry-favorited, bureaucracy-manipulated rules that had it flat on its back in the late-1970s.Hopefully, with the country seemingly committed to curbing unnecessary regulations, we won't make this mistake again.SIGN UP"	[]	[]

""So I believe the FBI investigation goes on into the Clinton Foundation, rather than the emails.""""Do you predict the media will try to make this seem as though the Clintons are completely exonerated from their corruption charges?"" Marlow asked.""I think you've already stated their conclusion,"" Fund replied.""We have never had a case in which a presidential candidate has so exposed national security secrets,"" he said. ""The FBI is apparently almost 99 percent convinced that Hillary Clinton's private server was hacked into by one or more foreign powers. This is unprecedented, and as of today, WikiLeaks has reported all kinds of things about Hillary Clinton's campaign - but I think with a single exception, there's not been one email from Hillary Clinton in that batch of WikiLeaks, 50,000 emails.

Watch those counties in eastern Kentucky, which are lower-middle-class white counties. See how big the turnout is there. That'll be an indicator of how much of a 'silent Trump vote' might be forming,"" he continued.""Florida is very key. If Hillary Clinton takes Florida or North Carolina early on, I think the dirge music for Donald Trump will start playing early. If Trump carries North Carolina, which Romney carried in 2012, and carries Florida - which is an enormous 29 electoral votes - it'll be a much longer night,"" he predicted.""If you take the average of all the polls, both state and national, it looks as if Hillary Clinton has a clear but slight lead,"" Fund observed. ""The polls have margins of error, and they certainly were wrong by about two points in 2012, so you don't want to go to the bank on them. However, turnout is key. Early voting I think has clearly benefited the Democrats. They have an enormous machine designed to drive people to the polls."" ""I think the whole question of whether or not early voting is a good idea has been brought into sharp relief this time because of the FBI investigation announcement just two weeks before the election. I think we should vote on Election Day,"" he declared. ""It would be ironic indeed, and it may be probable, that Donald Trump wins on Election Day, but loses because of the Democratic turnout machine in early voting.""Fund explained that much of the Democrat vote is concentrated in urban areas. ""Those are very high-density areas. It makes it very easy to use existing political machines in places like Chicago, and Philadelphia, and Detroit. You go to the local political organizations and say, 'Here's some street money. Here's $250, $300. Your job is to produce a certain number of votes from your district, and if you get that, you'll get a bonus. If you don't, well, we may not hire you next time.' So there's an enormous incentive for people to literally go door-to-door. Starting at eight or nine o'clock in the morning, they knock on doors: 'Have you voted? Have you voted?' Then they come back at eleven: 'Have you voted?' At two o'clock, five o'clock,"" he said. ""And then, of course, they organize buses to where certain people congregate to take them to the polls. There are some allegations in places that, well, maybe those buses visit more than one polling location, and maybe people are handed slips of paper saying, 'Here's the name you're gonna use to vote at this polling place, as opposed to the last polling place,'"" said Fund.Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.LISTEN:SIGN UP""Well, the FBI has certainly managed to muddle the waters,"" Fund observed, responding to Sunday's letter from FBI Director James Comey to Congress that the Bureau stood by its earlier decision not to recommend indictments against Hillary Clinton for mishandling classified information.

If Hillary Clinton takes Florida or North Carolina early on, I think the dirge music for Donald Trump will start playing early. If Trump carries North Carolina, which Romney carried in 2012, and carries Florida - which is an enormous 29 electoral votes - it'll be a much longer night,"" he predicted.""If you take the average of all the polls, both state and national, it looks as if Hillary Clinton has a clear but slight lead,"" Fund observed. ""The polls have margins of error, and they certainly were wrong by about two points in 2012, so you don't want to go to the bank on them. However, turnout is key. Early voting I think has clearly benefited the Democrats. They have an enormous machine designed to drive people to the polls."" ""I think the whole question of whether or not early voting is a good idea has been brought into sharp relief this time because of the FBI investigation announcement just two weeks before the election. I think we should vote on Election Day,"" he declared. ""It would be ironic indeed, and it may be probable, that Donald Trump wins on Election Day, but loses because of the Democratic turnout machine in early voting.""Fund explained that much of the Democrat vote is concentrated in urban areas. ""Those are very high-density areas. It makes it very easy to use existing political machines in places like Chicago, and Philadelphia, and Detroit. You go to the local political organizations and say, 'Here's some street money. Here's $250, $300. Your job is to produce a certain number of votes from your district, and if you get that, you'll get a bonus. If you don't, well, we may not hire you next time.' So there's an enormous incentive for people to literally go door-to-door. Starting at eight or nine o'clock in the morning, they knock on doors: 'Have you voted? Have you voted?' Then they come back at eleven: 'Have you voted?' At two o'clock, five o'clock,"" he said. ""And then, of course, they organize buses to where certain people congregate to take them to the polls. There are some allegations in places that, well, maybe those buses visit more than one polling location, and maybe people are handed slips of paper saying, 'Here's the name you're gonna use to vote at this polling place, as opposed to the last polling place,'"" said Fund."

Only in the past several years have officials with the Office of Refugee Resettlement regularly communicated with states about refugees, but those communications typically come after the arrival of the refugees, rather than in advance of their arrival, as the Refugee Act of 1980 requires.While the Refugee Act of 1980 requires the federal government to consult with local governments as well as state governments, Breitbart News has reported on several local governments who say they've never received any communications from the federal government before or after the resettlement of refugees.Two states, Alabama and Texas, are suing the federal government for placing refugees in their jurisdiction without complying with the Refugee Act of 1980's ""consultation clause.""L. Brooks Patterson, the county executive of Oakland County, Michigan said in September that the county also intends to sue the federal government for placing thousands of refugees in the county without complying with ""the consultation clause.""The trustees of one township in Michigan, Waterford, recently unanimously passed a resolution stating that the township  ""will not actively participate in the refugee resettlement program.""Trump vigorously attacked Hillary Clinton's plans to significantly increase the number of refugees admitted to the country, which the most recent Breitbart-Gravis national poll shows is opposed by more than a two to one margin, 59 percent to 28 percent.""Hillary wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees pouring into our country. And she wants virtually unlimited immigration and refugee admissions, from the most dangerous regions of the world, to come into our country and to come into Minnesota, and you know it better than anybody,"" Trump said.""Her plan will import generations of terrorism, extremism, and radicalism into your schools and throughout your communities,"" he continued.""When I'm elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program and we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country,"" Trump announced.The crowd broke into chants of USA! USA! USA!""How stupid, how stupid are our leaders. How stupid are they to allow this to happen,"" the GOP nominee added.Trump then made specific reference to the refugee problems in Minnesota, where Breitbart News has reported that 304 refugees have been diagnosed with active tuberculosis (TB) over the past six years.""The whole world knows what's happening in Minnesota. The whole world knows what's happening to you,"" Trump told the enthusiastic audience.""Here in Minnesota you've seen first hand the problems caused with faulty refugee vetting, with large numbers of Somali refugees coming into your state without your knowledge, without your support or approval, and with some of them then joining ISIS and spreading their extremist views all over our country, and all over the world,"" Trump added.""Everybody's reading about the disaster taking place in Minnesota, everybody's reading about it. You don't even have the right to talk about it, you don't even know who's coming in, you have no idea. You'll find out. You'll find out,"" he said.""You've seen the recent terrorist's knife attack in St. Cloud,"" Trump said, a reference to the September 17 attack on ten Americans at a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota by Somali refugee Dahir Adan, who was killed in the midst of his attacks by an off-duty policeman.""It's the least they can do for you. You've suffered enough in Minnesota,"" Trump said.""And we will pause admissions from terror-prone regions until a full security assessment has been performed, and until a proven vetting mechanism has been established,"" he added.""And if you want people to just pour into Minnesota all you have to do is vote for Hillary Clinton, because that's what she's going to do. I don't care how liberal you are I don't care how politically correct you are, how stupid this has been,"" Trump said of the Obama administration.""A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And yes, we will build a great wall,"" he added.""Hillary supports totally open borders. There goes your country!"" Trump said.Trump's stop in Minnesota, coming just two days before Election Day is a bold bid to win a state that Real Clear Politics rates as ""Lean Clinton,"" and that has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1972.The Real Clear Politics average of polls gives Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton a 6 point lead in Minnesota. The state, however, has been lightly polled. The most recent poll listed in the Real Clear Politics average was conducted between October 22 and October 23.A Breitbart-Gravis poll conducted on September 23 showed the race to be a tie, but no other polls have shown a margin closer than 8 points.Minnesota has 10 electoral college votes.At a rally in Sterling Heights, Michigan later in the day, Trump made a similar argument about that state as well.""Here in Michigan, you've seen firsthand the problems caused with the refugee program... It puts your security at risk and it puts enormous pressure on your schools and your community resources,"" the Republican presidential nominee told an estimated crowd of 8,000.Sterling Heights is located in Macomb County, a suburb of Detroit that neighbors Oakland County.Real Clear Politics recently moved Michigan from ""Leans Clinton"" to a tossup.

James Cartwright who was charged with lying to the FBI about discussing classified information with reporters about Iran's nuclear program, during a probe.Pence continued, ""you have a sailor that just went to jail for taking a half-a-dozen photographs in a classified area of a nuclear submarine. So let me say this, if only for their decades of self-dealing with the politics of personal enrichment, mishandling classified information and compromising our national security, we must ensure that Hillary Clinton is never elected president of the United States of America.""Pence declared, ""the American people have had enough,"" ""and they have especially had enough of the fast and loose ethics of Bill and Hillary Clinton."" The crowd enthusiastically chanted, ""Lock her up!""FBI Director James Comey issued the bureau's conclusion through a written statement on Sunday. This second probe into Clinton's emails was conducted using classified materials that were unearthed in emails found in the Anthony Weiner underage sexting investigation.Comey wrote, ""Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.""Pence was not having it. ""Ladies and gentlemen, mishandling classified information is a crime."" He reminded the audience that ""Hillary Clinton said there's nothing marked classified on her emails, sent or received, and the FBI director told to Congress, that's not true.""He also pointed out that Clinton said she did not email any classified information to anyone. ""And the head of the FBI told to Congress, there was classified information that was emailed.""Separate emails also indicated that a top State Department official had attempted to offer the FBI quid pro quo if the bureau agreed to let Clinton alter the classified status of the documents found on her private server.RNC chairman Reince Priebus issued a statement to Breitbart News, following Comey's announcement, making it clear that the FBI's public corruption investigation of the Clinton Foundation -- which has raised billions of dollars -- is ongoing:The FBI's findings from its criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton's secret email server were a damning and unprecedented indictment of her judgment. The FBI found evidence Clinton broke the law, that she placed highly classified national security information at risk and repeatedly lied to the American people about her reckless conduct.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERNate Silver, the left's favorite polling guru, posted a chart on Sunday showing Trump is doing far better in midwestern states than Gov. Mitt Romney did in 2012.Silver's analysis shows Trump has gained 6 points over Romney in Ohio and Iowa, and has closed the gap with Hillary Clinton down to almost error-margin levels in crucial Michigan and Pennsylvania. That midwestern success is what gives Trump a one-third chance of winning the election, said Silver. ""Clinton underperforming Obama's 2012 forecast by *4 points* in the Midwest. That's a major liability,"" he tweeted.On Sunday night, according to RealClearPolitics's average of polls, Clinton was ahead of Trump in Pennsylvania by just 2.4 points (46 percent to 43.6 percent), and ahead in Michigan by 4.7 points (44.7 percent to 40 percent). A win in either state could be enough for Trump to win the election. GOP leaders in Michigan and Pennsylvania have plenty of reasons for optimism, even as Trump is still lagging in the polls. ""I think what's happening is that you're seeing demographic shifts that cross state lines,"" said Saul Anuzis, a former chairman of the Michigan GOP. This shift reaches across Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania,"" he told Breitbart News.These blue-collar voters can be difficult to get to the polls, he warned. ""It is difficult to turn them out [on election day]. But the fact that they are willing to stand in line for hours [at Trump rallies] tells you something,"" he said. ""I would not be surprised if Trump won 40 states or lost 40 states -- if the wave of blue collars comes out, I can see him sweeping the states.""In a bus trip across the northern part of the state, GOP spokeswoman Sarah Anderson kept track of the lawn signs and posters.

Silver's calculations show Trump leading in Ohio by 2.3 points, even though Obama won the state by 50.7 percent to 47.7 percent in 2012. CBS reports that Trump surged by 5 points in the last four weeks.Trump's deputies say Ohio's early voting patterns show a big swing to Trump.So the blue-collar wave exists -- but neither Trump, not Clinton know if it is enough to sweep her out of politic and sweep him all the way down the Potomac and into the Oval Office.

Absentee and Early Voting continues to be up in key Romney-carried counties statewide.
In Lake County, there have been 1,135 more ballots cast to-date than at this point in 2012, a 4 percent increase.
Warren County has 3,954 more votes have been cast to date, a 15 percent increase from this point in 2012.
Marion County has the largest jump in ballots cast to date of all Romney counties, which is running ahead of the 2012 pace in ballots cast by 25 percent.
Contrast this with the Democrat strongholds, which all continue to see a drop-off in voter turnout.
Franklin County is seeing over 25,000 fewer ballots being cast at this point compared to 2012, which amounts to a 15 percent drop.
In Lucas County, where President Obama won with a 32% margin, there has been a 20% decrease in voter turnout compared to 2012.

The other was a Syrian citizen who has yet to be identified, Anadolu said.Turkey has in the last year been hit by a string of major suicide bombings blamed on IS including a triple attack at Istanbul's main airport in June that left 47 dead and an August blast at a Kurdish wedding in the southeastern city of Gaziantep that killed 57 people, 34 of them children.IS, which is believed to operate sleeper cells in major Turkish cities, never claimed these attacks.A news agency affiliated to IS jihadists said they staged a bombing on the southeastern city of Diyarbakir last week that killed 11. If confirmed, it would be the first claim by IS for an attack in Turkey.But on Sunday, the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons (TAK), seen as a splinter group of the better-known Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), said it had carried out the attack.SIGN UPANKARA (AFP) - "	[]	[]

He now lives in self-imposed exile in Abu Dhabi as he would face corruption charges if he returned to the Palestinian territories.""The Constitutional Court ... stated that President Abbas has full authority to cancel the immunity of any parliament member, when the legislative council is not convened,"" a statement published by official Palestinian news agency, WAFA, said.Abbas opponents and analysts said the court's decision confirmed fears they raised when he formed the nine-judge panel in April, saying it would give him too much power and would effectively allow him to cancel the role of the Palestinian legislative council - the territory's parliament.The legislative council has not convened fully since the 2007 civil war that ended with Hamas taking control of the Gaza Strip when they ousted forces loyal to Abbas from the coastal enclave.The court ruled that Abbas's 2012 decree to cancel Dahlan's immunity ""had been made according to the authority afforded to the president by law"".Dahlan made no immediate comment but Majed Abu Shammala, a Fatah official close to him said the court's decision reflected the political will of Abbas and not the law.The ruling means that Abbas could also stop Hamas's Aziz Dweik, the speaker of the legislative council, from becoming caretaker president should Abbas die in office or resign.Under the constitution, the speaker becomes interim president in such an event.Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said the group did not recognize the court or its rulings because it was a wholly Fatah entity.SIGN UP"	[]	[]

Another said some of the needed Arab forces were still in training. Like seven other officials interviewed for this report, they requested anonymity to discuss the issue.U.S. Marine General Joseph Dunford, the top U.S. military officer, played down the idea that seizing Raqqa would be quick or easy, saying the first job was sealing off the city.""We always advertised that the isolation phase is going to take months,"" Dunford was quoted as saying on Sunday by a U.S. defense department reporter traveling with him in Turkey.Dunford's visit to Ankara came as the Obama administration is enmeshed in a delicate balancing act between NATO ally Turkey and rival Syrian Kurdish forces trained and equipped by the United States.The U.S. plan for Raqqa calls for an assault force of thousands of fighters from the Kurdish Peoples Defense Units, known as the YPG, and Arabs whose job it would be to take and hold the city itself, U.S. officials said.However, U.S. special operations forces in northern Syria have yet to recruit enough Arabs to take and hold the Arab-dominated city, they said. Some U.S. officials and experts doubt that the United States will be able to soon field an Arab force large and strong to defeat thousands of Islamic State militants who have had months to prepare a final stand.They pointed out that some 25,000 Iraqi troops, militiamen and Kurdish peshmerga fighters are involved in the offensive to wrest Mosul from an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 militants.""Raqqa is every bit as infested as Mosul, perhaps even more so,"" said Thomas Lynch, a National Defense University fellow and retired Army officer. ""But there is an enormous investment by this administration in terms of going after Raqqa before it leaves office.""Administration advocates of a rapid assault on Raqqa think YPG units will participate and enough Arabs will be enlisted and trained as the noose around the city tightens.Another problem is fighting that pits the YPG against U.S.-backed Syrian Arab rebels supported by air power, artillery, armor and special forces from neighboring NATO ally Turkey.""HAND-HOLDING EXERCISE""The YPG is one of America's best allies in the fight against Islamic State. But Turkey denounces the YPG as an appendage of the PKK, a group that has fought for decades for independence for Turkey's Kurdish minority and is on the U.S. terrorism list.The sides are embroiled in a race to capture al Bab, a non-descript town held by Islamic State. Its fall to the Turkish-backed force could prompt the YPG to reject a role in the Raqqa offensive and alter the course of the conflict in northern Syria.""That would be the outcome we least desire,"" a second U.S. official said.Obama spent more than two hours on the telephone in late October with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan as part of an intense U.S. diplomatic drive to overcome Erdogan's objections to YPG participation in the Raqqa offensive, U.S. officials said.""For us, the linchpin here is for the Turks to exercise enough restraint (and) get them to resist the temptation to do anything that would spark a conflict that might get out of control,"" said the second U.S. official. ""It's a hand-holding exercise on both sides of the aisle.""But he and other U.S. officials acknowledged that crushing Islamic State is not as high a priority for Erdogan as ensuring that the YPG cannot knit Kurdish enclaves in northern Syria into a de facto state that could strengthen the PKK.RUSSIAN COMPLICATIONSThe situation is further complicated by Russia, which intervened last year in Syria's civil war to shore up President Bashar al-Assad. With aircraft and advisers deployed around Syria, Russia has warned Turkey against advancing more than 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) into Syria, said the second U.S. official.For now, the Turkey-backed force has stopped short of al Bab, which is about 30 kilometers from the Turkish border, U.S. officials said.Taking al Bab would expand a buffer zone that Turkey is establishing inside Syria to seal its border from Islamic State infiltration. Turkey's incursion also has prevented the YPG from unifying the northern Kurdish enclaves.Moreover, al Bab's fall to the Turkish-backed force would expand a potential Turkish-protected ""safe zone"" for moderate Syrian rebels, who could base their internationally recognized government-in-exile in the area.The rebels also could use such a zone to re-establish supply corridors from the Turkish border and open a new front aimed at relieving the Syrian regime's siege of opposition-held eastern Aleppo, experts said.""An eventual reopening of the Aleppo city front is an inevitability,"" said Charles Lister, an expert with the Middle East Institute in Washington.

Climate Alarmism	"On the eve of the U.S. elections, a number of pundits and leaders--including Pope Francis--continue to warn Americans against an undefined ""politics of fear,"" while simultaneously spreading the fear of the nebulous enemy of ""global warming.""SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIn a speech delivered at the Vatican Saturday, Pope Francis denounced making political decisions based on fear, because fear ""weakens and destabilizes us, destroys our psychological and spiritual defenses, and numbs us to the suffering of others,"" he said.""No tyranny can be sustained without exploiting our fears,"" he said.Meanwhile, fantastical reports emerge every day stoking fears of climate change and attributing every possible ill to a supposed evil that none truly understands.On the same day of the Pope's Vatican speech, the online journal Business Insider ran an ominous scare piece titled ""7 foods that could go extinct thanks to climate change,"" which threatened that global warming is ""endangering some of the most popular and delicious foods on the planet.""""Here are seven foods and drinks that could grow more expensive and eventually disappear due to climate change,"" the essay confidently announced: avocados, coffee, beer, oysters, maple syrup, chocolate and lobsters.If telling people they will have no more chocolate or beer if they don't approve climate change agreements doesn't constitute the lowest form of fear-mongering, it would be tough to find an example that does.Moreover, the article fails to mention that global warming scares are routinely debunked almost as soon as they are propagated.To take just one example from the Business Insider article itself: the supposed extinction of coffee.""In September, a report from the nonprofit Climate Institute concluded that the area around the world fit for coffee production would decrease by 50% due to climate change,"" the essay declared.Already, ""climate change has made coffee crops more vulnerable to diseases like coffee rust, which have wiped out more than a billion dollars in crops,"" it said.The problem with these claims? They are completely false.What the article failed to mention was that just a month after the Climate Institute story, a group of researchers from the University of Exeter released a comprehensive study on coffee and climate change, asserting that the supposed connection between the world's coffee supply and ""climate change"" was completely baseless.Although mainstream media reports, including newspapers such as the New York Times, have linked coffee production with climate change, the scientists said they found ""no evidence"" for this, leading them to ""reject the climate change hypothesis.""The researchers published their findings in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, in which they conclude:""We find no evidence for an overall trend in disease risk in coffee-growing regions of Colombia from 1990 to 2015, therefore, while weather conditions were more conducive to disease outbreaks from 2008 to 2011, we reject the climate change hypothesis.""So not only does climate change alarmism play into people's deepest dread of the unknown, it also plays fast and loose with the facts.If Pope Francis is correct that fear ""weakens and destabilizes us, destroys our psychological and spiritual defenses"" and that ""no tyranny can be sustained without exploiting our fears,"" citizens would do well to look upon climate change hysteria with a wary and watchful eye.Follow Thomas D.

With the start of the offensive to conquer Raqqa, the Syrian fighter believes his dream of going home will soon come true.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERGharib, 25, fled Raqqa in 2014 when militants of the Islamic State (IS) group arrived, but on Sunday he was upbeat at the prospect of returning.""I'm very happy, very happy. All my comrades are from Raqqa. I cannot describe my joy,"" he told AFP.""We want to take these positions back from the oppressors. They say they come in the name of Islam but do not know Islam. God willing, we will be victorious.""His face bearded and head wrapped in a black scarf, Gharib spoke near Ain Issa, an operations centre for the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) Kurdish-Arab alliance.He is just one of the 30,000 men and women, Arabs, Kurds and Turkmens, engaged in operation ""Wrath of the Euphrates"".SDF forces are advancing against the de facto IS capital in Syria on three fronts, from Ain Issa and Tal Abyad to the north, and from the village of Makman to the east.""The US forces are supporting us. Thank God, we have everything we need. We have weapons, PKC machine guns, artillery, everything is ready and our morale is high,"" Gharib added.From a mound of earth in the rocky desert landscape, SDF fighters and nearly two dozen Western soldiers watched IS positions a few kilometres away to determine targets for coalition air strikes.The rumble of aircraft engines overhead was constant.In the distance, black smoke rose. One of the fighters said it was probably an IS car bomb that was hit.Near an all-terrain vehicle piled with equipment, four soldiers were busy, one with American markings on his helmet.Another soldier in dark glasses who held a drone spoke French.""Everything is going well,"" he told AFP.The SDF asked the AFP journalists not to approach the other soldiers because they were ""guests"".Returning from the front line, fighters bearing rocket-propelled grenade launchers and light weapons drank tea as they took a break.Women fighters in military fatigues chatted among themselves.""There are a lot of clashes, and in particular they [IS] are sending car bombs. So far they sent four,"" said Diljin Kobani, a local commander with the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), a backbone of the SDF alliance.She said two were destroyed, a third blew himself up and the last was hit and retreated.""For the world, Raqqa has a great importance, and that is why the coalition forces help and support us in this campaign,"" Kobani added.""They help us with their air force coordinating on the ground, with reconnaissance aircraft and strikes on the positions of IS elements. Their support is outstanding.""Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria are the last two major cities still controlled by IS, which has lost much of the territory it conquered in 2014 in both countries.Talal Sello, a spokesman for the SDF based in the northeastern city of Hasakeh, told AFP earlier on Sunday by telephone that forces would first seize areas around Raqqa before moving on the city itself.SIGN UP"	['Issa']	['god']

The young Trump fan, who was out far past his bedtime, still had the strength to hoist his Trump sign above his head.""This is the most important election of our lifetime,"" Krolick said. ""The Constitution, everything this country was founded on.""I have two kids going to come up -- I'm trying to make this country great again. I fear for our democracy, and our republic, if Hillary Clinton is elected.""She shoved corruption in the faces of the American people and dared us to react in this election.""Panoramic shot of #Leesburg #Virginia rally for #Trump at 12:30 a.m. Packed, overflowing, thousands after midnight pic.twitter.com/n554NAf2ge-- Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) November 7, 2016The rally had originally been scheduled for 9:30 p.m., and was packed long before that, but Trump ran late as he packed four earlier campaign rallies into an ambitious Sunday schedule, including rallies in Iowa, Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania.As the traveling press arrived at Dulles International Airport, it was unclear, from afar, whether anyone would have stayed three hours overtime to hear Trump -- especially on a school night, the night before a busy work week.Yet the hall was completely full, with supporters jostling to be near the front -- and a large overflow outside.One of those on the barricades in the overflow section was Brianna Baker, 16, of Purcellville, Virgina, who insisted on coming to the rally with her mother. They had been at the fairgrounds since 7:00 p.m.""I've just seen Trump on TV. All my friends are Democrats, and they're bashing on Trump. I would like to see him in person to know what he's all about,"" she said. (Moments later police allowed her into the main hall, with a few others.)Randall Watson, a retired Navy veteran from Loudon, Virginia, stayed up late with his family to see Trump, gently encouraging his young daughter, who had endured the wait. ""You're a trooper,"" he told her.He told Breitbart News that he was determined not to see the Clintons returned to the White House.""I was a steward in the Clinton White House,"" he said. ""Hillary Clinton is not a nice person at all. She made everybody feel uncomfortable.""Trump praised the strength of the audience -- and even had a rare word of praise for the media, who had trailed him throughout the day. He joked that their cameras were ""sagging"" from the effort.""We're going to make America strong again -- like the people that are here at one o' clock in the morning -- strong people,"" he said.Trump also emphasized the importance of religious liberty in the election, among other constitutional rights.He concluded: ""We are one day away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life,"" he said, modifying the tagline from the ""two days"" he had used just hours earlier that evening in Pennsylvania.Prior to Trump, Rev. Jerry Falwell, Jr., president of Liberty University, had addressed the audience.""At stake in this election are our right to life, our religious liberties, the Second Amendment, and even the existence of the state of Israel,"" he said.""I've heard it said that the Trump campaign has become a movement. Well, I think it's more than a movement. I think it's become a peaceful revolution,"" he said, to cheers.Falwell praised the Republiacn Party platform as ""the best platform, the most conservative platform we've had in years.""And he warned: ""If we lose the Supreme Court, everything else is a moot point.""Virginia has 13 electoral votes. It was once a solidly conservative state, then became a swing state, before moving more definitively into the Democratic column in 2008 and 2012.Its political shift has accompanied population growth in Northern Virginia, where many federal government employees -- who typically vote Democratic -- have lately made their homes, alongside thriving tech startups.Hillary Clinton had earlier decided not to air campaign advertisements in Virginia, since she presumed she would win there. But polls have been tightening, with one poll even showing Trump leading Clinton by three points in the state.So Clinton poured resources into Virginia again -- and Trump is looking to make the most of the rare opportunity.Joel B.
