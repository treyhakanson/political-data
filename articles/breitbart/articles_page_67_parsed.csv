Not only did he not do so (and I was present at all times) but it was she that was the one being flirtatious,"" Anthony Gilberthorpe said in a note provided to The Post by the Trump campaign.In an exclusive interview arranged by the campaign, Gilberthorpe said he was on the flight -- in either 1980 or 1981-- where Jessica Leeds claimed Trump groped her.Read the rest of the article here.SIGN UP"	['Trump']	[]

The AR-15 used in the Sandy Hook attack was legally made and was sold and registered to Nancy Lanza, Adam's mother. He stole that gun from her, then shot and killed her before going to the school.The suit against Remington was filed in October 2014. BBC News reported that court documents in the filing said, ""There is one tragically predictable civilian activity in which the AR-15 reigns supreme: mass shootings. Time and again, mentally unstable individuals and criminals have acquired the AR-15 with ease, and they have unleashed the rifle's lethal power into our streets.""A couple of points need to be made. First, AR-15s by no mean reign supreme in ""mass shootings."" As with other crimes, handguns are by far the weapon of choice and shotguns are popular as well. In fact, the key component to ""mass shootings"" is not the type of gun used but the location of the shooting, which is predominately a gun-free zone. Secondly, Lanza did not acquire an AR-15 with ""ease""-rather, he had to steal it.During the Democrat primary Bernie Sanders said that Sandy Hook families ought not be able to sue Remington for the illegal use of a gun that was acquired through thievery. The New York Daily News questioned Sanders on this point:NY Daily News asked, ""There's a case currently waiting to be ruled on in Connecticut. The victims of the Sandy Hook massacre are looking to have the right to sue for damages the manufacturers of the weapons. Do you think that that is something that should be expanded?""Sanders responded, ""Do I think the victims of a crime with a gun should be able to sue the manufacturer, is that your question?""The NY Daily News said, ""Correct.""Sanders replied, ""No, I don't.""AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

Other people that are a little worried to speak out because of possible persecution.""CBS 19 reports that Parks was openly and legally carrying a firearm and that he was later joined by another Trump supporter who was carrying a firearm as well.Dittmar volunteer, Su Wolff, was bothered by how long Parks stood outside the office. She said, ""If he wants to support his candidate that's fine, but don't come here and stare into the office all day."" She was also bothered that Parks' gun was visible whenever his side was turned toward people walking past or toward him.Candidate Dittmar took to Facebook over the Trump supporters, writing:We'd like you to be aware of a situation at our Fluvanna County campaign office.

Strassel notes that although ""the nation now has proof of pretty much everything [Hillary Clinton] has been accused of,"" the media ""has almost uniformly ignored the flurry of bombshells, preferring to devote its front pages"" to the story that Donald Trump ""made lewd remarks a decade ago and now stands accused of groping women.""SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER From Strassel in the Wall Street Journal:The Obama administration--the federal government, supported by tax dollars--was working as an extension of the Clinton campaign. The State Department coordinated with her staff in responding to the email scandal, and the Justice Department kept her team informed about developments in the court case.Worse, Mrs. Clinton's State Department, as documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show, took special care of donors to the Clinton Foundation. In a series of 2010 emails, a senior aide to Mrs. Clinton asked a foundation official to let her know which groups offering assistance with the Haitian earthquake relief were ""FOB"" (Friends of Bill) or ""WJC VIPs"" (William Jefferson Clinton VIPs). Those who made the cut appear to have been teed up for contracts. Those who weren't? Routed to a standard government website.The leaks show that the foundation was indeed the nexus of influence and money. The head of the Clinton Health Access Initiative, Ira Magaziner, suggested in a 2011 email that Bill Clinton call Sheikh Mohammed of Saudi Arabia to thank him for offering the use of a plane. In response, a top Clinton Foundation official wrote: ""Unless Sheikh Mo has sent us a $6 million check, this sounds crazy to do.""...The leaks also show that the press is in Mrs. Clinton's pocket. Donna Brazile, a former Clinton staffer and a TV pundit, sent the exact wording of a coming CNN town hall question to the campaign in advance of the event. Other media allowed the Clinton camp to veto which quotes they used from interviews, worked to maximize her press events and offered campaign advice.Read the rest here.

Clinton and her GOP rival Donald J. Trump, according to the WBUR-FM poll conducted Oct. 10 through Oct. 12 with 501 of the state's likely voters.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERClinton is the choice of 41 percent to Trump's 38 percent, after undecided respondents were pressed to make a decision with Libertarian Gary Johnson, 11 percent, and Green Party nominee Dr. Jill Stein, three percent, according to the poll's executive summary. The poll carries a 4.4 percent margin of error with a 95 percent level of confidence.In the initial questioning, the numbers were the same, except Trump was at 37 percent, which suggests that undecideds may be shy Trump supporters.WBUR-FM's previous poll, conducted Sept. 27 through Sept. 29, showed Clinton ahead of Trump with 42 percent to Trump's 35 percent.In the 2012 presidential election, President Barack Obama won New Hampshire with 52 percent of the vote over W. Mitt Romney, his Republican rival.Another positive sign for the Trump campaign was the speech given by First Lady Michelle Obama Thursday in Manchester.The speech was celebrated in the left-wing media as a stinging rebuke of Trump from Obama's wife when she criticized the New York City developer for his relationships with women.But, in the closing weeks of the campaign, sending FLOTUS anywhere is calculated.In August, Gallup polling showed that the first lady had the highest favorables of anyone in the presidential group of candidates, spouses, or in the current administration, with 64 percent of respondents having a favorable opinion and 32 percent with an unfavorable opinion.In fact, of all the ""presidential"" personalities, the president's wife is considered not only the most popular, but also the least politically-sensitive or overtly political, when she speaks. Much of this is a function of her being less politically engaged.Thus, the decision to ""engage"" the first lady is not a light one.Bottom line: Michelle Obama's speech against Trump was important, but it could have been given anywhere. If the Clinton campaign sent her to New Hampshire, rather than any other place in the country, they are signalling that New Hampshire is absolutely in play for Trump.SIGN UP"	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

Notably, neither mentioned the accusations against Trump, which Clinton and her surrogates have mentioned at nearly every other opportunity in the past several days.They likely avoided the topic for a very good reason: Al Gore has been accused of worse, and has even faced police investigation for sexual assault, though (he has never been charged).As the Business Insider reported in 2010:Former Vice President Al Gore has been hit by new allegations of sexual assault. This time, it's two more massage therapists bringing the charges.The former VP is already in hot water, fighting abuse claims in Portland, where another masseuse said Gore groped her in '06 and asked her to perform a ""chakra release"" (massage-speak for ""hand job"".) He denies everything.The new allegations are said to have taken place at two hotels - one in Beverly Hills in 2007, when Gore was in Hollywood for the Oscars, the other in Tokyo in 2008.A source from the luxury hotel in Beverly Hills told The Enquirer: ""The therapist claimed that when they were alone, Gore shrugged off a towel and stood naked in front of her."" He then propositioned her for a sexual act, according to The Enquirer.One accuser called Gore a ""crazed sex poodle.""In their reporting on the joint Clinton-Gore appearance, the media ignored the allegations against Gore, even as he shared the stage with Hillary Clinton.Joel B.

I'm a pro-military, pro-equal pay, pro-Second Amendment, pro-immigration, and pro-business Hispanic woman voting for Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton is not a strong leader. Blindly voting for Clinton because she happens to be a woman does not prove feminist bonafides. For me, it would go against everything my husband and I have stood for: love of family, strength of our local community, and defense of our country.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERI have seen my husband get dragged through the mud and called every name in the book by cowards on Twitter and in the opinion pages. I've been criticized myself by the left because they cannot comprehend or respect a woman choosing to vote for Mr. Trump. Because I choose to reject the decades of lies and corruption of Hillary Clinton and her husband's sordid past, I've been called uneducated, (I have a law degree by the way), a puppet (I actually urged Ryan to support Trump), a disgrace to women, and so many more things that are not fit to print. The intolerance of the modern Democratic Party is a far cry from the Democratic Party I used to support as an independent voter.Let me tell you why I do support Mr. Trump. I'm a wife, daughter, mom and grandma, and I love our country. Like our daughter and granddaughters, I care about what is going on around the world. When Ryan was deployed commanding troops in war, it was my job to keep morale up at home. Navy SEALs are more than colleagues, they are brothers. We are family. When Ty and Glenn died in Benghazi it shook our family. When Hillary Clinton lied about it, it was a slap in the face. When she criticized families for calling her out in it, it was un-American. As a military wife and mom, I will never support somebody who does not support the military.Everyone knows my husband was a Navy SEAL for 23 years. I also have a daughter who is a Navy Diver and my son in law is an active duty SEAL. My youngest son is considering military service as well. Hillary Clinton will continue the dangerous foreign policy she and President Obama started and she will continue to put out troops in harms way with no plan. This will open us up to more casualties abroad and more terrorist attacks at home.I'm a small business woman. I am also the mom of two college students who are about to face an economy that under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton doesn't have jobs for them. Nearly 13 percent - that's the unemployment rate for millennials. Taxes, regulations, and economic conditions are important. I believe Trump's business acumen will help build a stronger economy and he will surround himself with incredibly smart and successful individuals rather than career bureaucrats.We all know Mr. Trump has said some regrettable things. He's since apologized. I got over it. With everything that is going on in the world - Iran and North Korea flexing nuclear muscle, terrorist attacks in America, high unemployment with millennials - I think this election is about more than locker room talk.Lolita Zinke is a small business woman, wife of Congressman Ryan Zinke, and a volunteer member on Donald J.

It addressed deficiencies in the Clinton Foundation's structure and oversight, including the potential for conflicts of interest due to the Hillary Clinton's role as Secretary of State.The auditors noted that ""some interviewees reported conflicts of those raising funds or donors, some of whom may have an expectation of quid pro quo benefits in return for gifts."" They also flagged a potential problem in the charity's IRS filing:... the IRS Form 990, which is signed under penalties of perjury and is publicly available, asks (a) whether the Foundation has a written conflict-of-interest policy, (ii) whether directors, officers, and key employees are required to annually disclose interests that could give rise to conflicts of interest, and (iii) whether the Foundation regularly and consistently monitors and enforces compliance with its conflict-of- interest policy. The Foundation indicated on its 2010 Form 990 that it has a written conflict-of- interest policy, requires annual disclosure of potential conflicts of interest, and monitors and enforces compliance with the policy. However, we did not find evidence of that enforcement.The auditors concluded with a recommendation (original emphasis): We recommend that the Foundation establish a gift acceptance policy and procedures to ensure that all donors are properly vetted and that no inappropriate quid pro quos are offered to donors in return for contributions.However, a report compiled in August 2013 on the internal review, published on the Clinton Foundation's website, implies that the new gift acceptance policy and procedures had not yet been adopted. Hillary Clinton had already left the State Department earlier that year.Other problems with the Clinton Foundation at the time included that its board did not have a chair, and was not very involved in running the charity.

Vermont is also one of only seven states where write-in candidates are completely allowed and counted as equal to the actual candidates (along with New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Iowa).That means Sanders threatens to peel off Vermont's three electoral votes in the same way that Trump could pick up an electoral vote in Maine's second district, where he is leading big league.In September 2012, this reporter wrote of ""The Northern Strategy,"" a concerted effort by Northeastern conservatives to shore up electoral support on the Senate, House, and gubernatorial level in the aftermath of Scott Brown's historic 2010 Senate victory in Massachusetts. Brown is a strong Trump supporter.Trump's campaign stop at Sacred Heart University in Connecticut shortly before Steve Bannon's hiring as campaign CEO was notable for its attacks on the Monica Lewinsky scandal and for Trump's Ross Perot-style poster props.Breitbart News reported from Manchester, New Hampshire the night of Sanders' New Hampshire primary win:With 4.7 percent of the precincts reporting, Sanders had 7,548 votes (53.3 percent) to Clinton's 6,315 (44.6 percent).Sanders' win was fueled by a massive turnout by independent voters and non-Democrats.41 percent of Democrat voters were independents and only 55 percent were registered Democrats......The line was out the door at Sanders headquarters at Concord High School in Concord, New Hampshire prior to the announcement....Clinton's loss comes just one year after she led Sanders by 56 points in the polls. Sanders is now the first Jewish candidate to win a major presidential primary.What happened?Clinton suffered bad optical defeats here in recent days. There was the rally where Bill Clinton's Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that women have a ""special place in Hell"" if they don't support fellow woman Hillary Clinton. There was the remarkableFreudian slip by aging feminist Gloria Steinem, a Clinton supporter, who said that young women gravitate toward Bernie in order to meet ""boys.""The leftist uproar was swift and devastating. Clinton surrogate and Massachusetts state treasurer Deb Goldberg even hopped on a Clinton conference call to demand that the campaign make sure that Albright and Steinem are ""kept away"" in the future.How jarring all this must be for the Clintons.In the debates as in her awkward interview with Black Lives Matter protesters, Clinton resorts to dredging up the feminist victories of her past. She was, after all, a Vietnam-era radical, a Wellesley College campus idealist. As First Lady she went to China and gave a speech at a pro-woman summit in 1995 that featured a tent devoted to the cause of lesbianism. Doesn't anyone remember? Her campaign is selling T-shirts about it in its online store.Bill Clinton, as he did against Obama in 2008, stumped around New Hampshire to dwindling crowds railing against Sanders. How dare Bernie supporters attack his friend Joan Walsh, the Salon editor, another relic of his bygone decade?""She and other people who have gone online to defend Hillary and explain -- just explain -- why they supported her have been subject to vicious trolling and attacks that are literally too profane often -- not to mention sexist -- to repeat,"" Bill Clinton said.The progressives didn't buy it. Internet social justice warriors don't respect campus legacies. They just wonder why ""New Democrat"" Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act and didn't do anything about mass black incarceration. An entire progressive movement happened while the Clintons were palling around with Goldman Sachs. And the new movement is hostile to anything in American culture that came before it.The cultural Left is done with the Clintons. As evidenced by Sanders' cameo opposite Larry David on the last Saturday Night Live, Bernie is the new Obama. Even Chelsea Clinton slipped up and referred to Bernie as ""President Sanders.""Cachet, at least in politics, can only be gained once. And even if the Clintons manage to win the delegate count against Bernie in the end, they've lost a commodity that can never, ever be returned. With 4.7 percent of the precincts reporting, Sanders had 7,548 votes (53.3 percent) to Clinton's 6,315 (44.6 percent).
Sanders' win was fueled by a massive turnout by independent voters and non-Democrats.
41 percent of Democrat voters were independents and only 55 percent were registered Democrats...
...The line was out the door at Sanders headquarters at Concord High School in Concord, New Hampshire prior to the announcement.
...Clinton's loss comes just one year after she led Sanders by 56 points in the polls. Sanders is now the first Jewish candidate to win a major presidential primary.
What happened?
Clinton suffered bad optical defeats here in recent days. There was the rally where Bill Clinton's Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that women have a ""special place in Hell"" if they don't support fellow woman Hillary Clinton. There was the remarkableFreudian slip by aging feminist Gloria Steinem, a Clinton supporter, who said that young women gravitate toward Bernie in order to meet ""boys.""
The leftist uproar was swift and devastating. Clinton surrogate and Massachusetts state treasurer Deb Goldberg even hopped on a Clinton conference call to demand that the campaign make sure that Albright and Steinem are ""kept away"" in the future.
How jarring all this must be for the Clintons.
In the debates as in her awkward interview with Black Lives Matter protesters, Clinton resorts to dredging up the feminist victories of her past. She was, after all, a Vietnam-era radical, a Wellesley College campus idealist. As First Lady she went to China and gave a speech at a pro-woman summit in 1995 that featured a tent devoted to the cause of lesbianism. Doesn't anyone remember? Her campaign is selling T-shirts about it in its online store.
Bill Clinton, as he did against Obama in 2008, stumped around New Hampshire to dwindling crowds railing against Sanders. How dare Bernie supporters attack his friend Joan Walsh, the Salon editor, another relic of his bygone decade?
""She and other people who have gone online to defend Hillary and explain -- just explain -- why they supported her have been subject to vicious trolling and attacks that are literally too profane often -- not to mention sexist -- to repeat,"" Bill Clinton said.
The progressives didn't buy it. Internet social justice warriors don't respect campus legacies. They just wonder why ""New Democrat"" Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act and didn't do anything about mass black incarceration. An entire progressive movement happened while the Clintons were palling around with Goldman Sachs. And the new movement is hostile to anything in American culture that came before it.
The cultural Left is done with the Clintons. As evidenced by Sanders' cameo opposite Larry David on the last Saturday Night Live, Bernie is the new Obama. Even Chelsea Clinton slipped up and referred to Bernie as ""President Sanders.""

The most recent insurers to quit Obamacare were Aetna and UnitedHealth Group, both which announced they were abandoning Obamacare this year.Aetna, for instance, announced it had lost $300 million in 2015 alone.Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini also pointedly noted that Obamacare lacks honesty in how customers are informed about the way insurance really works.The massive changes will cause costs to rise up to fifty percent next year for those who have not lost their plans, and will also likely leave customers with fewer plans to choose from at costs that are much higher than they currently are. In addition, many doctors and hospitals will no longer be included in the networks for the lower-end plans.The losses will mostly affect individuals who have purchased their insurance plans through the Obamacare exchanges, instead of receiving their coverage from their employers.According to its review, Bloomberg found that nearly 100,000 customers per state will lose insurance in Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Tennessee. Closer to 300,000 in North Carolina will lose coverage, and more than 400,000 will be dumped from plans in Florida.The warnings that Obamacare is on the verge of collapse have been sounding for several years.

Catholic voters notice her campaign's harsh words for their faith and should consider themselves lucky to have seen a preview of how a Clinton presidency would treat them.McGuire notes Clinton stated last April that ""deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs have to be changed"" in order to make abortion more favorable and acceptable.Other Catholic and Evangelical leaders have joined together to ""express our outrage at the demeaning and troubling rhetoric used by those within Secretary Clinton's campaign - and those associated with the campaign to describe our communities.""In a press release, the Christian leaders describe the Clinton campaign anti-Christian rhetoric as ""inexcusable,"" ""shameful,"" and ""un-American.""They continue:Historically, Evangelicals and Catholics have had significant theological differences, dating back to the Protestant Reformation.

Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) was a guest on Friday morning's Breitbart News Daily, where SiriusXM host Matt Boyle asked about the significance of Hillary Clinton's admission in private paid speeches that she favors ""open borders,"" disclosed by WikiLeaks.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBlackburn agreed with Boyle's contention that it should be a ""smoking gun"" that disqualifies Clinton from the presidency.""When you go in and look at the speeches that we now have access to, and the volume of money she was paid - $225,000 for a one-hour speech? It's unbelievable,"" she said. ""In one of those speeches, she said she was for a hemispheric common market. She was for open borders and for open trade. Now, that is not what she says when she's out there on the campaign trail, but in her heart of hearts, she knows that that is her position, and when she is comfortable, and feels like she is talking to people that will agree with her, then yes, she is going to say that.""""Also, she admitted in those emails that she knew it was impossible to vet the Syrian refugees that were coming in. There's not a system,"" she added. ""So Matt, you can get great insight into what is happening within Clintonworld by reading these emails. You have John Podesta sending one out, back in March, that she hates everyday Americans. And you have another one, where the staff - there's a thread where they are all so concerned because she is a habitual liar. How can people go vote for someone when her own staff is having a difficult time reacting to, and dealing with, her lying?"" Blackburn asked.Boyle cited another leaked email chain in which Clinton discusses having different public and private positions on major issues, something Blackburn said ""should be of tremendous concern to everyone.""""Here she says that in order to politically survive, or to be successful, you have to have two different positions: one you express in private, and one you express in public. That just shows you she's gonna lie to you. She's never going to tell you the truth. She's going to tell you what she thinks is most expedient for her - not for you, but for her,"" Blackburn said.She described the revelations about ""FOBs,"" or ""Friends of Bill Clinton,"" receiving special favors during Haitian relief efforts as evidence of ""cronyism"" and further validation that ""they use the Clinton Foundation as a money-making enterprise.""""What they did was to try to shill - to circumvent the tax law, circumvent the taxes, worked through a non-profit, so that they were avoiding paying taxes, and used that to steer contributions to the Foundation. The Foundation spent about 90 percent of what it brought in on overhead and other expenses and salaries, and then gave about 13 percent of what it brought in to charities,"" she explained.""And then, alongside that, they ran their speaking organization. Bear in mind, Bill and Hillary Clinton claim they were 'dead broke' - dead broke! - when they left the White House. Today, they are worth over a quarter of a billion dollars. They have never created a company. They've never created a job. They established a foundation, employed a skeletal staff, spent about $30 million a year on that staff and benefits. This has been their get-rich-quick mechanism,"" Blackburn said.She expressed a preference for letting Congress investigate Clinton's activities, rather than appointing a special prosecutor.""Matt, I've got to tell you: right now, at this point, I think we're better leaving it with Congress because if we call for a special prosecutor, we would have to shut down our investigation and give them time to stand up,"" she explained. ""Then we would have to turn over all of our information and leave it with them. So, at this time, I think we leave it with the House and see where we can continue to get on this.""""The report that we did, that grew out of our work at Energy and Commerce, I have shared that with the other committees that have jurisdiction and oversight. We know that they are continuing to look at this. Chairman Chaffetz and his committee is continuing to look at it. Let's just see where we can get with it, keeping it with us,"" Blackburn advised.She said the 2016 was critical because ""if you want change in the way things are done in Washington, you're going to vote for Donald Trump.""""If you're happy with the status quo and enjoyed the Obama years, then Hillary Clinton is going to be your person. If you want higher taxes, if you want more government regulations, if you want to see more litigation that is fostered in these compliance costs, Hillary's for you.

""Honest services fraud, when asked by the Congress, was actually far too broad, and was something that law enforcement was accused of taking advantage of, and including every area of life. So the Supreme Court narrowed it to include only, basically bribery, or things that were related to bribery of public servants and other areas.""""That narrowing did not preclude a public servant from falling within the purview of that law,"" he continued. ""Now, I pled to that law because I provided, I was sort of the other side of the transaction that Hillary and her folks are on. I was one who provided gifts and contributions and all the rest to public servants, in order to get, in essence, outcomes for my clients.""""What I see with her - I don't know her, I mean I've met her a few times when I was a lobbyist, but I don't know her, I don't know her people, and I wasn't involved in it. But from what I've read and what I've seen, it seems very clear to me that what they were doing is, in essence, selling the assets of the people, the federal government, for contributions to the Clinton Foundation,"" he said. ""To me, this was classic honest services fraud, where you had - it's not bribery, obviously. Bribery is very difficult to define in U.S. law, statutorily. It is a standard that is usually too high to meet - but what, in essence, was going on there is that the Foundation team was soliciting contributions at the same time as facilitating access to our public servants, to the secretary of state and her staff, and in some cases getting results, and in some cases not getting results, but that does not matter. In essence, what the result is, is the access,"" Abramoff explained.When Boyle mentioned the abnormally high percentage of meetings Secretary of State Clinton gave to Clinton Foundation donors, Abramoff interjected that ""my point is, even if one of them is with a Clinton Foundation donor, if somebody gave money to the Clinton Foundation, and the quid pro quo was getting a meeting, or getting a phone call returned, that gets you into that area.""""What puzzles me is that Director Comey of the FBI - I mean, this is the same FBI that investigated me, and properly referred charges to the Justice Department that filed charges against me for these things,"" Abramoff said. ""And I'm not alone, by the way. I'm not trying to say, therefore, why did they pick on me? They picked on me because they should have picked on me. I broke the law, unfortunately. I wish I didn't, but I did, and I was properly punished. What I think irks people who have been through this process - and don't forget, over two million Americans have been through the criminal process, or are in the criminal process right now, and many more have been through it - is watching somebody almost blatantly and flagrantly violating the law here, and that no one charges these people, and no one brings it to justice.""""This is something that I think is wrong,"" he declared. ""I'm not necessarily saying, in these remarks, anything other than the fact that I think it's unjust to our justice system to watch this happen. When people are out there thinking about committing a crime, they now can think, 'Well, if Hillary gets away with it, and Bill gets away with it, maybe I can get away with it,' and that undermines our society far worse than, God forbid, the election of Hillary to the presidency.""Abramoff said that while he's obviously not involved in the FBI's deliberations, ""I can't for the life of me imagine the conversation at the FBI, in terms of referring criminal charges to the Justice Department, why Director Comey and others would conclude that no prosecutor would bring charges against her.""""I think it's astonishing,"" he said. ""On the services fraud, they certainly seem to have destruction of evidence, obstruction of justice, there seems to be count after count after count going on here, let alone that she, in fact, in an interview with the FBI - which somehow wasn't recorded, or at least notes weren't taken, very bizarrely - if she had lied in that encounter, then that's perjury. Because the fact is, as soon as you lie to an investigator, you've sort of fallen into that area.""""I can't for the life of me understand it, other than to conclude that there was a political decision made here, and that is extremely dangerous,"" Abramoff said. ""Whether it's Hillary, or it's Trump, or it's anybody - even if it had happened to Reagan! - people cannot be allowed, because they're in high political office, to escape the consequences of their actions, any more than I wasn't allowed to escape the consequences of my actions.""On the question of whether a special prosecutor should be appointed for Clinton, as Donald Trump promised in the second presidential debate, Abramoff spoke highly of the FBI agents and lower-level Justice Department personnel with whom he worked, saying they were ""to a person incredibly honest, incredibly professional, and I can't for the life of me imagine any of these people going along with something like this, so it probably had to be made at a political level, at the top, which completely undermines it.""""Now, should there be a special prosecutor?"" he continued. ""I think, absolutely. There should have been a special prosecutor from the beginning. We all knew - nobody thought, and I would go around in the interviews I was doing at the time, saying Hillary will either be nominated or prosecuted, and I don't for the life of me believe she'll be prosecuted because the Obama administration is extremely political. If they were a Republican administration acting like this, they would be considered worse than whatever Nixon was trying to pull off, in those days."" ""And so I never thought she would be prosecuted,"" Abramoff confessed. ""But it's an outrage given what's coming out since, that they can, with a straight face, say that there's no need for a special prosecutor, there's no need for any of this. So Donald Trump saying there should be a special prosecutor, I think is a completely normal statement."" ""In terms of his remark about 'you'd be in jail,' that's probably political theater, probably not helpful in terms of if there ever were to be a real case pursued against these people,"" he added. ""But let's not kid ourselves. If Hillary Clinton's elected president in a couple of weeks, there will never be a prosecution of this, and these people will have gotten away with selling our government for hundreds of millions of dollars. That is a very disgusting and profound act. It will never, ever be dealt with.""Abramoff noted sardonically that when he was prosecuted, all of his emails were ""subpoenaed and then just sent over to the media by Senator McCain, and others who were kind of attacking me, so all of the things that I wrote also bore out, in many cases, things that - unfortunately for me - were embarrassing, and were things I regretted.""He said Clinton was now getting ""the same kind of treatment,"" thanks to WikiLeaks, but ""it seems clear, based on everything that we've seen, that there are some real issues here, and whether or not there's a prosecution, whether or not there's justice here, we'll just have to see. The American people are going to have to make that decision themselves.""Abramoff said he had ""no particular insight as to what might come out"" in future document dumps, but ""it seems what's clear is that every day, we're getting more and more examples of Hillary, her people, and her Foundation and the rest were playing this kind of backroom game - with money, with power, with government, and with things that, again, if they were Republicans, they would have to leave the country, pull out of the race.""""I think we're probably likely to see more of that, and unfortunately, the more we see of it, and then if it's ratified by an election that elects her, what kind of message have we sent to our kids? What kind of message have we sent to ourselves, that this is the kind of country that we've basically ratified?"" he asked. ""This is the kind of corrupt politician that we are okay with. It has never been the case in American history that we're okay with it.""""This election is a referendum on, do we elect someone to the presidency who's openly been flaunting our laws and been corrupt within our government, selling our government,"" Abramoff declared.

She mentioned the detail in her 1995 book, ""Passion and Betrayal.""In our interview, Flowers, the former local news reporter and singer, provided new details about what she says was the abortion experience, including Bill Clinton's alleged involvement in helping her get through the process.She stated:""Interesting story. I was a news reporter at the time. I also had a little show, a little for your information show and I had on the lady who was running the abortion clinic because needless to say it was very controversial in town. And I had had her on my show. Well, little did I know at that very moment I was actually pregnant. Well that was in 1977. And I found out later after that interview. And I told her, you know, to arrange something hopefully that was sort of private.""But yes, I told him (Bill Clinton). And deep down I wanted to hear him say okay well I'm going to get a divorce and we'll have this baby and everything is going to be fine. And the first words out of his mouth were, 'Well you know I will pay for an abortion.'""And of course my heart sunk. And then the reality you know hit me right in the face. That he was married and he was going to stay married. And that's the way it was. So I thought fine. I wasn't prepared to have a baby and raise it on my own so I decided to go ahead and have the abortion.""Flowers recounted what she said were the emotional and physical effects of the abortion:""It was not only physically painful but it was very psychologically painful. Because I love him. And it was really psychologically a horrible thing to go through. I remember after the procedure was done I went into a room. I was sitting there and I just started sobbing and it seemed like the subs came from my stomach and up. It was the deepest sobs that I've ever done. And anyway like I said it was a horrible experience in every way.""...When I drove into the clinic there were protesters. And I was afraid somebody was going to recognize me as a news reporter. And anyway, got inside and then at a point you know I had the procedure. And I was able to be alone in a room.""She said Clinton paid $200 for the abortion procedure.I asked whether she was certain that the baby was his.""Absolutely,"" she replied. ""Which I find amusing when I hear the stories that Bill supposedly can't have kids. To that point he and Hillary didn't have any children. Didn't have Chelsea yet. And he had told me that he didn't think that he could have kids. And that was why I was more casual with birth control then I would have been normally.""Flowers said that Clinton was emotionally there for her afterwards. ""He was very sweet,"" she said. ""And gentle. And seemed very sorry that I had gone through what I had. I don't think that he would have changed his mind. But he sincerely seemed to have sympathy and like I said and also cared about the physical pain as well.""Abortion services were available at a select few locations in Arkansas at the time.In 1977, Arkansas added an amendment to its constitution to prohibit the use of state funds to pay for abortion services.  In 1978, the Harvard Crimson reported the minimum price for an abortion that year, at least in Massachusetts, was $150.Meanwhile, Flowers stated that Hillary ""absolutely"" knew about the alleged affair as early as 1977, when Flowers says the affair began.""I know she did because there was a security guard at the mansion. Back then we didn't have cell phones. So he (Bill Clinton) would have key people - whether it be Betsy Wright or a security guard at the mansion - for me to call and ask for and then that person would get a message to him to call me back.""And one day he came in and the security guard told him that I had called and gave him the message. And what he didn't know was that she (Hillary) was actually there and was walking up to meet him and heard the guard say my name. And that I had called. And so she had a conversation with him a little bit later that she was getting real tired of hearing that name. And that she wanted it to stop. And he told her it wasn't gonna stop. And she said, 'Well, Just at least don't embarrass me.' Well of course he went on to embarrass her. Many, many times.""They had only been married about three months when he and I started our affair. You know, they didn't have Chelsea. It started early on in their relationship as well.""Flowers never sought to go public. Her name was put out there against her will when former Clinton insider Larry Nichols, who claimed he was improperly dismissed by Clinton from a state job, mentioned Flowers in court documents. In a lawsuit, Nichols alleged that Clinton diverted state funds to engage in extramarital affairs with five women, and he named Flowers, and four others, including former Miss America Elizabeth Ward Gracen and former Miss Arkansas Lencola Sullivan.Nichols would later drop his lawsuit, but the charges helped form the basis for tabloid stories alleging that Clinton had extramarital affairs, including with Flowers.Three days after Star Magazine mentioned Flowers as Clinton's alleged mistress, Bill and Hillary Clinton appeared in January 1992 side by side on ""60 Minutes,"" where Bill denied a relationship with FlowersTo protect her reputation, Flowers held a press conference the next day where she played excerpts from tape recordings she had made of private phone calls with Clinton. In a deposition in 1998, Bill Clinton admitted he had a sexual encounter with Flowers.Aaron Klein is Breitbart's Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

But Abedin warned that Hillary Clinton would not be pleased, particularly after learning that Podesta was involved in getting the speech canceled.""HRC very strongly did not want him to cancel that particular speech,"" she said. ""I will have to tell her that WJC chose to cancel it, not that we asked.""Mook argued that it would be a political risk, saying that Clinton's speech would be ""begging for a bad rollout.""""I would suggest that if she is determined to keep this speech that she talk with John because this is a very big deal in my view,"" he wrote.He continued:I know this is not the answer she wants, but I feel very strongly that doing the speech is a mistake-the data are very clear on the potential consequences. It will be three days after she's announced and on her first day in Iowa, where caucus goes have a sharply more negative view of Wall Street than the rest of the electorate. Wall Street ranks first for Iowans among a list of institutions that ""take advantage of every day Americans"", scoring twice as high as the general election electorate. I recognize the sacrifice and dissapointment (sic) that cancelling (sic) will create, but it's a very consequential unforced error and could plague us in stories for months. People would (rightfully) ask how we let it happen.A half an hour later, Abedin emailed to note that Clinton finally agreed to cancel.""Just raised with her again. We are good to cancel esp if WJC is ok with it,"" she wrote. ""Just needed a cool down period.""SIGN UP"	['Clinton']	[]
29	29	http://www.breitbart.com/jerusalem/2016/10/14/obama-aides-expected-weigh-syria-military-options-friday/	Obama, Aides Expected to Weigh Syria Military Options on Friday	"(REUTERS) - U.S. President Barack Obama and his top foreign policy advisers are expected to meet on Friday to consider their military and other options in Syria as Syrian and Russian aircraft continue to pummel Aleppo and other targets, U.S. officials said.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSome top officials argue the United States must act more forcefully in Syria or risk losing what influence it still has over moderate rebels and its Arab, Kurdish and Turkish allies in the fight against Islamic State, the officials told Reuters.One set of options includes direct U.S. military action such as air strikes on Syrian military bases, munitions depots or radar and anti-aircraft bases, said one official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.This official said one danger of such action is that Russian and Syrian forces are often co-mingled, raising the possibility of a direct confrontation with Russia that Obama has been at pains to avoid.U.S. officials said they consider it unlikely that Obama will order U.S. air strikes on Syrian government targets, and they stressed that he may not make any decisions at the planned meeting of his National Security Council.One alternative, U.S. officials said, is allowing allies to provide U.S.-vetted rebels with more sophisticated weapons, although not shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles, which Washington fears could be used against Western airliners.The White House declined to comment.Friday's planned meeting is the latest in a long series of internal debates about what, if anything, to do to end a 5-1/2 year civil war that has killed at least 300,000 people and displaced half the country's population.The ultimate aim of any new action could be to bolster the battered moderate rebels so they can weather what is now widely seen as the inevitable fall of rebel-held eastern Aleppo to the forces of Russian- and Iranian-backed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.It also might temper a sense of betrayal among moderate rebels who feel Obama encouraged their uprising by calling for Assad to go but then abandoned them, failing even to enforce his own ""red line"" against Syria's use of chemical weapons.This, in turn, might deter them from migrating to Islamist groups such as the Nusra Front, which the United States regards as Syria's al Qaeda branch. The group in July said it had cut ties to al Qaeda and changed its name to Jabhat Fatah al-Sham. ANOTHER TRY AT DIPLOMACYThe U.S. and Russian foreign ministers will meet in Lausanne, Switzerland on Saturday to resume their failed effort to find a diplomatic solution, possibly joined by their counterparts from Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Iran, butU.S. officials voiced little hope for success.Friday's planned meeting at the White House and the session in Lausanne occur as Obama, with just 100 days left in office, faces other decisions about whether to deepen U.S. military involvement in the Middle East -- notably in Yemen and Iraq -- a stance he opposed when he won the White House in 2008.Earlier Thursday the United States launched cruise missiles at three coastal radar sites in areas of Yemen controlled by Iran-aligned Houthi forces, retaliating after failed missile attacks this week on a U.S. Navy destroyer, U.S. officials said.In Iraq, U.S. officials are debating whether government forces will need more U.S. support both during and after their campaign to retake Mosul, Islamic State's de facto capital in the country.Some officials argue the Iraqis now cannot retake the city without significant help from Kurdish peshmerga forces, as well as Sunni and Shi'ite militias, and that their participation could trigger religious and ethnic conflict in the city.In Syria, Washington has turned to the question of whether to take military action after its latest effort to broker a truce with Russia collapsed last month.The United States has called for Assad to step down, but for years has seemed resigned to his remaining in control of parts of the country as it prosecutes a separate fight against Islamic State militants in Syria and in Iraq.The U.S. policy is to target Islamic State first, a decision that has opened it to charges that it is doing nothing to prevent the humanitarian catastrophe in Syria and particularly in Aleppo, Syria's largest city.Renewed bombing of rebel-held eastern Aleppo has killed more than 150 people this week, rescue workers said, as Syria intensifies its Russian-backed offensive to take the whole city.Anthony Cordesman of Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank suggested the United States' failure to act earlier in Syria, and in Aleppo in particular, had narrowed Obama's options.""There is only so long you can ignore your options before you don't have any,"" Cordesman said.SIGN UP"	['Obama']	[]
