That unity has been elusive for the past few days, as liberal America struggles to absorb the shock of Donald Trump's astonishing victory in the presidential election.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIf Trump had lost, conservatives would have been the ones struggling to cope, although we would have had an easier time of it. We did not expect to win, and up until Trump took the lead in Florida, the scene at the Midtown Hilton was more of a wake than a party.Among liberal friends and relatives, I have seen two reactions. Some have simply lashed out, even publicly. Those reactions are worth ignoring for now, because they reflect a raw emotional state of anger and distress that is not amenable to argument.Others have approached me quietly, seeking reassurance that Trump is not the ogre they have been led to believe he is, or just trying to understand how rational people could have voted for him, so they can process what happened. That is constructive.There are lots of reasons that smart people voted for Trump. But reason doesn't really suffice to communicate the point. The truth is that there are reasonable people on both sides of the political divide. They come to different conclusions because they start with different assumptions about reality, even if the journey from assumption to conclusion uses the same kind of logical reasoning on both sides. So the question then becomes where our assumptions come from, and why they are so different.The most important assumptions we make are about America itself. The default belief of the American conservative is that America is basically good. Liberals do not share this view, or think they do not. In their minds, America is capable of being good, but requires what Barack Obama called ""fundamental transformation."" America is not good, and started out rather badly. That is not a belief that comes naturally to most people. It has to be taught, and in fact is taught, sadly, in our schools.When Donald Trump ran on the slogan ""Make America Great Again,"" he rallied those who did not like the transformational shocks of recent years -- Obamacare, globalization, illegal immigration. It was not difficult for Trump's opponents to project, or to tell others, that what he really rejected were the positive changes that had brought America into closer harmony with its founding ideals, like civil rights and gender equality and religious tolerance. Trump's rhetoric made his vision easier to distort.And so the divide is partly about Trump, but really about deeper differences. Luckily, they are not irreconcilable.There are moments in American history when the conservative and liberal impulses -- to preserve and to change -- were able to meet. Those moments were always mediated through faith.We forget too easily that when Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. sought to change American laws, he appealed to white Americans through a common belief in God, and humans as ""God's children.""We have largely neglected the power of faith in recent years. At the funeral for the slain Dallas police officers last summer, President Barack Obama borrowed Dr. King's phrase: ""I see what's possible when we recognize that we are one American family, all deserving of equal treatment, all deserving of equal respect, all children of God. That's the America that I know."" But then he moved on -- tragically, given the opportunity he was wasting -- to his political priorities, renewing the division.God remains crucial to our national survival. You may not believe in God, and religion may play no role in your everyday life whatsoever. But it remains true that faith shaped the idea that each individual has dignity and inalienable rights, and that we are all created equal. As abstract philosophical postulates, those ideas had existed since antiquity. But they could never be put into practice without the uniquely American faith that such rights were God-given, beyond and prior to the power of the state.That was something the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson, understood.On the Saturday night before the election, Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, visited the Rebbe's grave, his Ohel, in Queens. Their visit was more than just a way to ensure good luck on Election Day. It was an affirmation of the Rebbe's understanding of America's role in the world, which is so well described by Joseph Telushkin in the book Rebbe: The Life and Teachings of Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Most Influential Rabbi in Modern History.Telushkin writes about why the Rebbe saw America as special:A nation of high ideals -- the Rebbe routinely referred to the United States as a ""government of kindness"" (malchut shel chesed) -- he saw America as perhaps the first society in which there was a hope of carrying out Judaism's universal mission: not to make the whole world Jewish but to bring the world, starting with the United States, to a full awareness of One God, Who demands of human beings moral behavior.At a meeting with Mayor David Dinkins, during the Crown Heights riots of 1991,the Rebbe expressed the hope that the mayor would be able to bring peace to the city. ""To both sides,"" Dinkins responded. The Rebbe replied, ""We are not two sides. We are one side. We are one people living under one administration and under one God. May God protect the police and all the people of the city."" For the Rebbe, and he emphasized this on different occasions, ""From many, one"" and ""In God we trust"" were the bedrock of the United States' power and specialness.In his stump speech on the campaign trail, Donald Trump had expressed strikingly similar sentiments in the last days before the election. I first noticed it on Monday, in his speech in Raleigh, North Carolina, when he closed by saying: ""We're fighting to bring us all together. ... Just imagine if we started working together, under one God, saluting one American flag.""When he said those words, which the crowd cheered loudly, Donald Trump was doing more than pandering to a socially conservative audience. He was connecting to America's idealism at the most fundamental level.Hillary Clinton's slogan, ""Stronger Together,"" also contained an appeal to national unity. But it was an insincere appeal, because Clinton made clear that you were not part of the ""together"" if you held certain views. (That was why her ""alt-right"" speech backfired.)The 17th century philosopher John Locke, whose ideas shaped those of the Founders, argued that people had the right to rebel against their government when it had been fundamentally changed against their will. One type of change was ""when such a single person or prince sets up his own arbitrary will in place of the laws which are the will of the society declared by the legislative.""In that grim circumstance, where public trust had been destroyed, ""the appeal then lies nowhere but to Heaven.""The Trump movement was a peaceful rebellion against the betrayal of trust -- and it was, for many, an appeal to Heaven. One woman at a Florida rally on Monday, carrying a sign that said ""God have mercy on America,"" told me only God could really make America great again, but Trump would do, for now, as a way to start.Now, after the election, faith in God is even more important. Faith contains gratitude for what we are, and hope for what we could be. It can bridge the divide. Let us seek Him.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Authorities shut down the Sadat metro station to prevent protesters from reaching the square famed for its political protests.There was a similarly heavy security presence in other areas of Cairo, such as the Shubra district, and other major cities across the country including Alexandria, Suez, and Minya.""Between you and me, this is good,"" said Shenouda Ishak, a driver in Shubra. ""I don't think anything will happen but this security presence scares people and ensures nothing does.""It was unclear if protests would go ahead on Friday as they have won little support from prominent activist and opposition groups, though they have been backed by the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood.But in a country where street politics helped unseat two presidents within two years, authorities are taking no chances. Dozens of people were detained in recent weeks for allegedly inciting unrest.Protesters camped in Tahrir Square in an 18-day demonstration ended Hosni Mubarak's 30-year rule in 2011. When Egyptians took to the streets again in mid-2013 to end a year of Brotherhood rule, they looked to general-turned-president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to restore stability.However many ordinary Egyptians and activists believe the heyday of street politics is over. After taking power, Sisi quickly crushed dissent and has applied a protest law so strictly that few dare to come out, despite rising public anger.'STREET ACTION LEADS TO BLOOD'In recent weeks, the president has urged Egyptians not to protest and warned that there would be no going back on economic reforms, no matter how much pain they might cause.State media reported that police were surrounding the entrances of Cairo and other cities to ensure that members of the Brotherhood did not sneak in.""Police have surrounded the entrances of Cairo, Giza, and Qalyubiya to prevent the terrorist group's elements from sneaking into any potential demonstrations heeding these call dubious calls and creating chaos,"" the state news agency said.The interior ministry said on Thursday that it confiscated a cache of arms and ammunition hidden in a graveyard and house by the Brotherhood in Fayoum province, southwest of Cairo.It also said it raided five bomb factories around the country on Wednesday, accusing a militant group of coordinating with the Brotherhood to attack police checkpoints on the eve of the protests.Stung by street revolts that have made life worse rather than better, many people said they would stay home.Reuters spoke to five activists who all said protests would achieve little and feared violence if they do materialize.""The revolutionary bloc is reticent to protest. We now know that any street action leads to blood. There is no result we can achieve with this regime,"" said Malek Adly, a human rights lawyer with the Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights.RISING PRICESSisi came to power promising economic reform and stability but problems have piled up. With a budget deficit of 12 percent and a looming funding gap, Egypt reached a preliminary deal with the International Monetary Fund in August for a $12 billion loan to support its reforms.The IMF board is set to meet on Friday to decide on approving the bailout program. It will disburse an initial $2.75 million loan tranche on the same day if the package is approved.Yet Egyptians feel clobbered by tax rises, soaring food price inflation and cuts in state subsidies.Core inflation is almost at eight-year-highs, over 15 percent, as a foreign exchange shortage and a hike in customs duties bite hard in a country that imports everything from sugar to luxury cars.Egypt raised electricity prices by 25-40 percent in August and introduced a 13 percent value-added tax approved by parliament in the same month.The government has tried to win public support for the austerity measures with a billboard campaign and media blitz and also sought to expand social security schemes to shield the poorest from the effects of the rising prices.But many Egyptians who would not qualify for such schemes complain they can no longer afford meat, while sugar shortages have driven fears of an impending food crisis.In his speeches, Sisi has sought to persuade Egyptians that a collective sacrifice is necessary to save the country from financial ruin, even urging people to donate spare change, comments that drew online derision.But he also warned that the army could be deployed within six hours in the event of street unrest.SIGN UPsecuritysecurity"

He also denied that the lack of a photo opportunity had anything to do with First Lady Michelle Obama not wanting to be photographed with the Trump family. He argued that it was not a ""snub"" of the Trumps, but rather a different strategy of press access.The press pool was allowed into the Oval Office on Thursday, to photograph Trump and Obama together after their 90-minute meeting. The two men met alone, with no staffers present.But Obama snubbed the press by telling Trump not to answer any of their questions after the meeting.""Here's a good rule. Don't answer any questions,"" Obama said to Trump after reporters shouted questions at the pair.Despite the pleasantries exchanged between the two political foes, Earnest specified afterwards that Obama still believed that Trump was unsuitable to be president.""Look, the president's views haven't changed, he stands by what he said on the campaign trail,"" Earnest said in response to a question during the White House press briefing.Earnest's remarks contrasted with Obama's welcome of Trump at the White House, promising to meet the standards set by President George W.

The pair also discussed raising children at the White House, as Baron Trump will live there with his parents.Earnest said that Michelle Obama understood the anxieties of ""living inside a museum"" like the White House and noted that it could be a ""difficult transition"" for families.White House communications director Jen Psaki and Deputy Communications Director Liz Allen met with Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks, according to Earnest, who also visited with her.Earnest hinted that the White House might release a photo of the two couples meeting.""We can go back to the White House photographer and see if there are any photos from the greet, so that you all can get some insight into how that went,"" he said.**Update:Speaking to CNN's Anderson Cooper, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway spoke about the details of the meeting.It was a great meeting.

Anderson writes in Slate that the reported 53 percent of white women voters who voted for President-elect Donald Trump ""sold out the sisterhood and the world"" for mostly racist reasons.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFrom Slate:According to CNN, 53 percent of white female voters voted for Donald Trump. Fifty-three percent. More than half of white women voted for the man who bragged about committing sexual assault on tape, who said he would appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade, who has promised to undo legislation that has afforded health insurance to millions of uninsured Americans, whose parental leave plan is a joke, who has spent his campaign dehumanizing nonwhite people, who has spent 30-plus years in the public eye reducing women to their sexual attributes. More than half of white women looked at the first viable female candidate for the presidency, a wildly competent and overqualified career public servant, and said, ""Trump that bitch.""What leads a woman to vote for a man who has made it very clear that he believes she is subhuman? Self-loathing. Hypocrisy. And, of course, a racist view of the world that privileges white supremacy over every other issue....Of course, the biggest and saddest reason white women chose Trump over Clinton is simple: racism. Trump tried to pit straight white men against everyone else--women, people of color, people in the LGBTQ community, immigrants--and white women decided they didn't want to vote on the side of ""everyone else."" They wanted to vote on the side of white men. White women decided that defending their position of power as white people was more important than defending their reproductive rights, their sexual autonomy, their access to health care, family leave, and child care. White women bought into Trump's lies about immigrant rapists and decided they'd rather have the respect of their angry white fathers, brothers, and husbands than the respect of literally everyone else in the world.White women sold out their fellow women, their country, and themselves last night. Most white women don't want to be part of an intersectional feminist sisterhood. Most white women just want to be one of the guys. And we will all suffer for it.Read the rest here. SIGN UP"

What's the conversation like? What do you think?""
Call into the show: (877) 240-1776Spiering said the president received amazing support and cooperation for President George W.

""I think that he was very thankful for that, when he was transitioning.""The White House correspondent said Bush seemed to ignore or dismiss that Obama had run for president promising to reverse everything Bush had worked for.""If you remember back then, in 2008, President Bush briefed Obama personally on some major issues, including the Iraq War,"" he said.The modern transition began when New York Gov. Franklin D. Roosevelt succeeded President Herbert Hoover on the Constitution's original date of March 4, 1933, but that interregnum was considered too long in light of the Great Depression. The 20th Amendment moved the date to January 20.

""I remember him talking about the directives--him to his transition team to the Obama team, his utmost priority was to transition smoothly, softly, and respectfully the office of the president-he always had a reverence for the position and the people he was overseeing.""Schilling said, ""I am hoping we'll see the same thing, but the contentiousness-the fact that these people don't like each other-and there is no other way to put that: They don't like each other-that has got to be an awkward thing.""Spiering said it could have been awkward between Bush and Obama, and Bush made sure it was not.""Bush really set the precedent. He was as respectful as possible,"" he said.Bush set the standard for the transition to be non-partisan and professional and Obama seems to be taking that standard and his role very seriously, he said.Obama even spoke about Bush's example Wednesday with reporters at the Rose Garden, he said.Join Curt Schilling weekdays from 9 a.m to 11 a.m., as he hosts Whatever It Takes broadcast live online at Breitbart.com.

Terwilliger III, said the Justice Department was expected to announce the indictment three weeks ago, but held back, so as not to be accused of making a political indictment just before Election Day.""We expect you will see today an example of the misuse of that power and it threatens unjustifiably to crush this young man's life,"" the attorney said.""Prosecutors are supposed to investigate crimes, not - as happened here - investigate a person, so as to see if they can find or create a crime with which to charge someone,"" said the man, who served 15 years in the Justice Department, including tours as deputy attorney general and acting attorney general.A source familiar with Schock's defense told Breitbart News that Schock, who belongs to a wealthy family, repaid all expenses associated with his office's operation and all travel allowances and reimbursements he received during his tenure on Capitol Hill.The source said the railroading of Schock out of Congress and possibly into court is part of a larger story involving a family rivalry between the Schock's and the LaHood's. President Barack Obama's Transportation Secretary Raymond H. LaHood held the same congressional seat before joining the president's cabinet. In the 2015 special election to replace Schock, the secretary's son Darin M. LaHood won the seat back for the family. LaHood defeated Breitbart News' late editor Michael Flynn in the GOP primary.The former congressman was one of the rising stars in the Republican Party. Before his March 31, 2015 resignation from Congress, Schock sat on the powerful Ways and Means Committee and was a senior deputy whip. The previous year he chaired the National Republican Congressional Committee's annual fundraising dinner, bringing in $15 million for the the House Republicans' political wing.Schock said if the Justice Department does indict him it is a miscarriage of justice and way out of proportion to mistakes in judgement that were in no way violations of law.""After the government realized there was no crime, they chose to spend the next 19 months, using two grand juries and millions of taxpayer dollars - in an attempt to manufacture a crime,"" he said. ""I simply cannot believe it has come to this. However, we are here not by my choosing. But since we a here where we are - I intend to not only prove these allegations false, but in the process, expose this investigation for what it was.""There is no way he or anyone on his staff broken the law, he said.""As I have said before, we might have made errors among a few of the thousands and thousands of financial transactions we conducted, but they were honest mistakes - no one intended to break any law. We worked tirelessly in my office to serve the constituents of this district and I will always be proud of that fact,"" he said.""I am eager to finally defend my name and reputation in a court of law and move on with my life. I have learned a painful lesson in this investigation - our own government cannot be trusted. But the people can be trusted. And we will put my future - once again - in the hands of the good people of this community,"" he said.Terwilliger said he will mount a vigorous defense against what he described as a criminalization of politics with all the markings of a political ambush.""After 19 months of investigating every minute detail of his life, this Democrat Administration waits until just after a national election to bring a devastating indictment against a man who was a rising Republican star, working way overtime for his constituents - and we are supposed to believe it's not political?"" he said.""This case smacks of the same political maneuverings in the federal justice system that we have seen way too much of in this administration.""SIGN UP"

27	http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/11/10/seven-reasons-liberals-chill-donald-trump/	Seven Reasons for Liberals to Chill About Donald Trump	"The Facebook freakout is epic. You've seen it: friends, relatives, and colleagues posting that they are not only sad that Donald Trump won the election, but actually physically afraid that he is going to round up all of them and send them to death camps.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSome of the hysteria is just political posturing. As every parent with toddlers knows, throwing a tantrum is a way to constrain authority. Flipping out about Trump is a way to oppose him. But for others, the fear is real.Here's how to calm them (or yourself) down.Step 1. Realize you were lied to about Trump being Hitler. Guess what? Trump is not Hitler and never was or will be. You were also told that his supporters were ""alt-right"" racists, antisemites, rednecks, etc. You know who his most important voters really were? The people who would have voted for Bernie Sanders, who wanted a ""political revolution"" -- and some of those are your friends. Trump's a flawed but decent man, with a complicated but beautiful, successful family. He's going to be fine.Step 2. Realize you can't win every presidential election, and that's OK. It's been a while since Democrats lost, so this bears repeating, especially since millennials who came of age with the Obama campaign may never have voted for a losing candidate before. 2016 marks the first time I have ever voted for a winning candidate (I never voted for George W. Bush or Bill Clinton), and I've survived until now. At some point, Republicans were going to win again. At some point, so will you.Step 3. Read this thing called the Constitution and learn to use it. You bought one when Khizr Khan waved one at Trump. Open it -- there's actually some good stuff in there, like checks and balances on the executive branch. Obama tried to destroy those checks and balances, which is one of the main reasons we fought so hard to resist him -- and one of the reasons voters rose up against him, as well as Clinton, on Tuesday. Use those checks against Trump and you can stop his worst tendencies.Step 4. Realize there are some things Obama did Trump won't reverse. If you like your gay marriage, you can keep your gay marriage -- really. Trump supports traditional marriage, but at this stage what that means is he will defend the right of a private business to refuse to participate in your wiccan lesbian polyamorous union. And you may have missed it, but Trump was the first GOP  nominee to talk openly about defending gays from persecution. (He won't touch your birth control, either.)Step 5. Expect immigration reform to look something like you wanted. If you could ensure that most of the 11 million illegal aliens currently in the United States would stay here, but build a wall across the border to prevent any more from coming, you'd take that deal, wouldn't you? Because that's what's likeliest to happen. And any deal on immigration Trump makes will have more credibility than any deal Clinton makes. Just stop waving that Mexican flag, and it will happen.Step 6. Recognize that this is the best time in America to be a woman. Trump hired a woman to run his campaign and she delivered. Women were also in key positions throughout Trump's campaign. Expect them to fill his administration -- and dust off your resume. You might be sad about Hillary Clinton's defeat, but it means that the first woman to break the glass ceiling probably won't be someone who got a lift through marriage, or who used public office to enrich herself. That's a good thing.Step 7. Realize that you might be wrong about a few things. The shock of Trump's victory is a good time to evaluate some of your beliefs. You can start with the assumption that everyone who opposed him was actually a racist. Half the country has different ideas, and some of those ideas really are very good. You're going to like Paul Ryan's budget, for example, and you're probably going to ask yourself why Obama didn't pass some version of it. Regardless, this is a ""teachable moment."" Use it.Want more good news? Check the stock market, which first slipped, then rose dramatically the day Trump won. Look at what Canada and Mexico are saying about re-negotiating NAFTA. The governments of Britain and Israel, our two closest allies, are   happy. And Trump's first meeting with Obama went well. If everything falls apart -- and it might, given the big challenges our country faces -- you can replace Trump in four years. You have until then to find a better alternative.

So wrote the poet William Wordsworth in 1792.  In my case, I'm feeling blissful, but, alas, not so young.  So I'm one for two.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBack in the late 18th century, Wordsworth was writing about the French Revolution (about which he was soon disillusioned).  In my case, here in the early 21st century, I'm thinking strictly positive thoughts about this latest peaceful American revolution, which begs comparison to two other political earthquakes: the Reagan Revolution of 1980, and the Gingrich Revolution of 1994.And now to the Trump Revolution of 2016.  Here are ten takeaway points:1) It's 1828 all over again.  Although 1980 and 1994 offer some parallels, perhaps the best 2016 comparison is to an election from nearly two centuries ago: the 1828 contest.  Back then, challenger Andrew Jackson mobilized a heretofore invisible coalition--that is, voters from such frontier states as Illinois and Missouri--against the incumbent president, John Quincy Adams.  Jackson's peaceful populist rebellion, remembered as the ""revolt of the rustics,"" swept the Tennessean into the White House.Without a doubt, that presidential campaign was bitter: It's fair to say that the Eastern elites of that era were as horrified by Jackson as the Eastern elites of our time have been horrified by Donald Trump.  For example, in the so-called ""coffin handbills"" that circulated widely in that campaign, Jackson was accused of everything from adultery to mass murder to cannibalism.Yet despite all that establishment vitriol, Jackson won, and thus launched a new political realignment.  And at the core of the new Jacksonian coalition was the alliance Southern white Protestants and Northern Catholics.  Those two groups didn't have much in common, except for a shared antipathy to Adams' political party, dominated by Yankee Protestants, who were the common foe of both Southerners and Catholics.Indeed, that ""anti"" spirit was enough to bind the Jacksonian factions together.  Thus in 1828, Jackson, Southerner that he was, carried not only South Carolina, but also Pennsylvania. That North-South coalition remained dominant in American politics for most of the next century-and-a-half, surviving even the Civil War.And yet along the way, the parties flipped, so that by the late 20th century, the Jacksonian Democrats had become Nixon-Reagan Republicans.  More recently, in the last quarter-century, this long-standing coalition, at least at the national level, has become partially undone.  That is, the South has been voting Republican for president, and the North has been voting Democratic.Now, in 2016, Trump has begun the process of gluing the North-South coalition back together: On Tuesday, like Jackson long ago, Trump carried both South Carolina and Pennsylvania--and the Keystone State had not gone Republican since 1988.  As Fred Barnes of The Weekly Standard headlined his post-election piece, ""Trump Didn't Split the GOP-He Strengthened It.""2) Americans don't like dynasties. Speaking of that 1828 election, one lesson is that Americans, instinctive small ""r"" republicans that they are, don't like dynasties, as they smack too much of royalty.  The same John Quincy Adams, our sixth president, was the son of the second president, John Adams.  And yet the younger Adams' defeat in 1828 spelled the end of the family's success in presidential politics.Moreover, we can see that in a democracy, dynasties are almost impossible to maintain, because political talent is not often heritable, nor is it transferrable--as Hillary Clinton has just reminded us.  And nobody sees an electoral future for Chelsea Clinton.So we can see now, in 2016: When Americans were confronted with two dynastic candidates, Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush, both were rejected.  Indeed, had it not been for the extensive collusion of the supposedly neutral Democratic National Committee with her campaign, Clinton might well have been derailed in the Democratic primaries, just as Jeb was in the GOP primaries.  (So we can see: Trump can be credited with putting the kibosh on two dynasties.)Finally, we can add that Clinton always faced an uphill climb, because  history shows that it's hard for the party in the White House to win a third consecutive term; in fact, it's happened only once since 1952, and that was back in 1988.3)  Brexit comes to America.  If references to 1828 seem too obscure, this election can also usefully be compared to the June ""Brexit"" in the United Kingdom.  As Breitbart readers know, Brexit was the vote that emancipated Britain from the clutches of the European Union.  In fact, Trump was quick to associate himself with that populist-nationalist spirit; as he said in the UK right after the vote, he would be ""Mr. Brexit"" for America.  And with a key assist from Nigel Farage, the hero of Brexit, Trump made it happen.Even now, at this early stage, we can itemize some of the bureaucratic Babels that the US will soon be freed from thanks to Trump's victory, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Obama administration's ""climate change"" agreement, which is currently on track to de-carbonize--read: completely de-industrialize--America in the next few decades.  Such are the benefits of sovereign independence.4) Most polls aren't worth much.  As with Brexit, virtually all of the polls about America's presidential election were wrong.  Indeed, even into the last hours, pollsters were arguing about the precise certainty of, and dimensions of, the looming Clinton victory.  Just last week, Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight.com was being attacked by Ryan Grim of The Huffington Post because Silver insisted that Trump had a 35 percent chance of winning, while Grim declared flatly that Trump had no more than a two percent chance.  The New York Times, meanwhile, although not as partisanly optimistic as The Huffington Post, averred that Trump had just a 15 percent chance of winning.Still, we can recall a short--very short--honor roll of accurate polls.  The two that leap to mind are  Investor's Business Daily/TIPP  and  USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times.  As the LA Times' David Lauter observed of his newspaper's surveys:The poll's findings caused dismay--even outrage--among some readers, especially Democrats, who have denounced it and often criticized the Times for running it.Of course, there's little reason to think that the MSM will embrace the success of those accurate polls.  Why?  Because they might show Republicans doing well, and, as we have learned, the standard MSM schtick is to proclaim, at all times, ""REPUBLICANS DOOMED!"" in the hope that Republican voters will lose heart.  In fact, Trump's victory notwithstanding, the mood of the MSM seems to be as hostile as ever, as evidenced by The New York Times' editorial after the election;  here's a sample of the Times' latest rant:Mr. Trump is the most unprepared president-elect in modern history.  We know that by words and actions, he has shown himself to be temperamentally unfit to lead a diverse nation of 320 million people.  We know he has threatened to prosecute and jail his political opponents, and he has said he would curtail the freedom of the press.  We know he lies without compunction.If that's the tone the Times takes, then a polling outfit that shows Republicans doing poorly will always be more welcome at Times HQ than one that might show Republicans doing well.5) Middle America has asserted itself, and these folks have their own ideas.  Throughout the '16 election, the MSM and the rest of the chattering class viewed the American working- and middle class with a combination of contempt and pity.  To illustrate, we can look back to July 13, when The New York Times headlined a news story, ""For Whites Sensing Decline, Donald Trump Unleashes Words of Resistance.""   We might pause to ask: Would the Times use the word ""decline"" in regard to any group, other than whites?  Indeed, as well we all know, the MSM has been joined in its anti-white mockery by big chunks of what's billed, these days, as ""comedy.""This liberal groupthink has been pervasive; it has settled like a thick fog on the worldviews of the chatterers in Washington, DC, New York City, and Los Angeles.  And while this hive-mindedness makes life comfortable for urban snobs, it also blinded them to larger realities, including the reality of their own declining influence.A few MSMers noticed this loss of mojo: One such is Politico's Jack Shafer, who wrote recently that media bias, as highlighted by Trump, had cost the MSM its power to affect the thinking of half the country:As a result of Trump's attack-the-messenger strategy, for perhaps the first time in U.S. history no mainstream outlet has any influence over the voters backing one of the presidential nominees.  This neutering of mainstream media by Trump has made it more difficult for the press to frame the issues effectively.In fact, it's even arguable that such scorn plays to the advantage of Republicans; that is, the MSM hostility is so heavy-handed that it has boomeranged.Hence Trump's victory, in which Republican voters were guided by everything but what they were being told by the likes of Clinton staffer-turned-Clinton donor George Stephanopoulos.  Thus Wednesday's rueful headline in The New York Times: ""Donald Trump is Elected President in Stunning Repudiation of the Establishment.""Meanwhile, the elite have finally discovered, to their dismay, that all those ""bitter clingers"" and ""deplorables"" have minds of their own.  As journalist Ron Brownstein noted, Trump won working-class white voters by a wider margin than did Ronald Reagan.  And those folks in the middle have distinct opinions on such issues as immigration, law and order, and trade that are much different from those of their self-appointed bi-coastal betters.Moreover, we can observe that while this smug culture of incomprehension and condescension has been a characteristic of the left, it can also be observed, in milder form, on the right.  That is, many Republicans, perhaps even today, just can't quite believe that Trump stands for anything more than reality-TV showmanship.  Yet as anyone who reads Breitbart, for example, knows, serious thinking has been going on about what a populist-nationalist center-right coalition might look like, even if the familiar DC think-tanks haven't been interested.Still, the new voices are loud and insistent.  One such belongs to Stephen K. Bannon, who stepped away from leading this site to serve as CEO of the Trump campaign.  Bannon put it bluntly to Breitbart editor-in-chief Alex Marlow on Wednesday morning's broadcast of Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM: ""Last night . . . you saw the hobbits finally had a chance to speak."" The phrase ""hobbits,"" of course, is an ironic reference to one of the many dismissive epithets hurled at grassroots activists in the past few years.And now that half the country has found its voice, it'll be darn hard for the Establishment to shut them up--although, of course, they'll certainly try.6) Wall Street took it on the chin.  As documented by many--the latest being Rana Foroohar in her new book, Makers and Takers: The Rise of Finance and the Fall of American Business-one of the big economic stories of the last few decades has been the rise of financialism.  That is, the rise of the spreadsheet economy and the decline of traditional inventing and manufacturing.  Foroohar notes, for example, that only 15 percent of the money ""invested"" by financial institutions goes into actual business investment; the other 85 percent is spent buying and selling existing financial instruments.  In other words, it's casino capitalism, and nothing more; that might be a formula for profits in Manhattan, but it's not a formula for jobs and livelihoods across the country.To be sure, Wall Street has been perfectly happy playing this new game: After all, to them, money is money; indeed, it's probably easier to make more by simply manipulating algorithms than by actually making things.  In fact, finance is so profitable--in some years, it has accounted for almost half the profits earned in the US--that the ""Masters of the Universe"" have barely noticed that public support for their activities has hemorrhaged away.  Hence headlines such as this, from Reuters: ""Wall Street elite stunned at Trump triumph.""  It's a safe bet that Wall Streeters will be paying close attention from now on--although whether or not they change their ways remains to be seen.  Now, the answer to that question must come from President Trump.In the meantime, it's more important for Republicans to be pro-Main Street than anti-Wall Street.  Nobody needs socialism; what's needed is more capitalism--specifically, more capital, along with a better business environment, for Flyover Country, so that new small businesses can sprout up somewhere other than Silicon Valley.7) President Obama also took it on the chin--or maybe the gut.  Here's the headline in Politico on Wednesday morning: ""Obama reeling from gut punch of Trump win/ America's decision to embrace Trump and reject Obama's third term shocked the White House.""  We can pause over that strong language, ""gut punch."" Once again, this was in Politico, a member in good standing of the MSM.  In the words of reporter Edward-Isaac Dovere:Obama said for months on the campaign trail that he'd consider Donald Trump's election a personal repudiation.  And it was.  The Senate and House results leave no question, as if there could be one.Then the Politico man added these words, sure to be painful to any progressive, about the prospects for the Obama administration's ideology in its waning days:They've already lost the chance to lock in Obama's vision of America, one that is educated and pragmatist, multicultural, cosmopolitan and globalist.Yes, that was, and is, the Obama administration: ""multicultural, cosmopolitan and globalist."" That's exactly what was rejected on Tuesday.8) The Republican Establishment now faces a challenge.  As everyone knows, the Republican Establishment was slow to embrace Trump--except when it was downright hostile.So now we can see: There are two Republican parties: First, the Trump Insurgents, and, second, the Establishment.For years, the bulk of the GOP Establishment has supported policies such as open borders and free trade.  That is, policies that were never popular with workers, including Hispanic workers, and now have been resoundingly rejected by Trump and his supporters.  And soon Trump will be the 45th President.So what will happen?  Can the GOP find a way to embrace the Insurgents and thus unite them with the Establishment?  If so, that would make the GOP a formidable force.   And as we have seen, there's ample precedent for such strange-bedfellow alliances; the aforementioned Jacksonian coalition--Southern white Protestants and Northern Catholics--was bitterly divided over such issues as Prohibition, and yet since they were even more bitterly opposed to the Yankees, they stuck together.So by that same reckoning, it's possible to imagine that Republicans will find common ground.  They can start, for example, with such issues as Life and the Second Amendment--and seal the deal with a conservative Supreme Court nominee to replace the late Antonin Scalia--although those unifying issues are no longer sufficient.  Indeed, even tax cuts, popular and necessary as they might be, are also probably not sufficient.Edward Conard, a prominent Mitt Romney supporter four years ago, has waded deeply into this coalitional pool. In his new book, The Upside of Inequality: How Good Intentions Undermine the Middle Class, he argues that if the investor class wants to keep its treasured low marginal tax rates, it must give substantial ground in other areas of importance to the middle class, notably, immigration and trade.  In other words, in Conard's view,  the focus must be on productive capitalism for America, not redistributive globalism for the world.9)  Evan McMullin will have to find a new career plan.  McMullin, the former Congressional staffer-turned-independent presidential candidate, was widely regarded as nothing more than a plutocratic cat's paw--that is, as a political tool to be wielded by rich Never Trump Republicans.Indeed, McMullin, at least at first, seemed to find a niche among pro-Bush 43 Republicans.  As Jim Antle wrote earlier this month in The American Conservative, ""McMullin supporters were generally happy with George W. Bush."" One is perfectly entitled to take that position, although not many do.  Antle added of McMullin:Many of his high-profile supporters wanted the Republican Party to nominate Marco Rubio, the candidate most closely associated with the 43rd president's legacy on immigration and foreign policy.In other words, McMullin was the candidate of the pre-Trump Old Guard.  For his part, Trump referred to McMullin as a ""puppet.""In fact, the Utah-born McMullin seemed to have only one goal this year: to deprive Trump of the Beehive State's six electoral votes, either by winning the state outright or by throwing the election to Hillary Clinton.  Either way, McMullin failed; he won just 20 percent of the Utah vote, finishing behind Clinton.  Meanwhile, Trump won the state with 46 percent.And yet here's something interesting about McMullin.  In the course of his campaign, he seemed to drift away from Trump-bashing and toward something with more of a future: liberating Western land from federal control.  As an astute observer has noted, federal lands contain hundreds of trillions--yes, that's trillions with a ""t""--of dollars worth of oil, gas, and other natural resources.  And yet all that wealth hs been locked up by Uncle Sam in the name of ""environmentalism."" Needless to say, the green left, never itself hurting for money, has been delighted by this lockdown.  And yet strangely, most Republicans have been quiescent about this national impoverishment.In the meantime, the feds have been ratcheing up the pressure on Western landowners and leaseholders, in what's clearly an accelerating effort to push Westerners off the land-all for the sake of owls, wind farms, and any other whim that floats a fancy in Manhattan or Malibu.So now, with the election behind him, and his Trump-destroying mission a failure, we'll have to see what path McMullin chooses.  Will he go to work for some big hedge fund?  Or will he stay in Utah and continue to champion the political rights, and economic future, of the West?If McMullin chooses the latter course, he might end up making a substantial contribution--a contribution, that is, not only to the pro-Trump Deplorables, but also to other Deplorables, notably working-class Hispanics and other minorities.  These ethnic groups, who seem to have mostly stuck with Clinton in this election, will soon enough figure out that the Green Democrats have no plan for getting them good jobs at good wages.  And why not?  Because good jobs at good wages typically consist of making things, or growing things, or mining things; that is, all the things that the Greens despise.  And out of that class conflict--trust-funded aristocrats and other varieties of NIMBY vs. people who need to work--comes a huge political opportunity for Republicans.  And if McMullin wants to help by reminding working Westerners that their future depends on pro-growth policies, more power to him.  So far, at least that's an ""if.""10) For all the talk about a Republican ""civil war,"" the bigger intra-party fight is likely to be among Democrats.  As we have seen, Republicans face their own coalitional challenges.  And yet the Republicans won; it's easier for victors to solve their problems, because success puts everyone in a good mood.  By contrast, losers, not surprisingly, tend to embittered and vengeful.And so, as the Democrats look to future elections, the intra-party wrangling must commence.In fact, it has already commenced: In her surprisingly classy concession speech on Wednesday, Clinton hit many familiar Democratic themes, but notably omitted any mention of the Democrats' more extreme positions, such as support for open borders, support for ""retraining"" the police, and praise for the Black Lives Matter group.  So how will those omissions  sit with Democrats who hold the opposite position?  Stay tuned!In the meantime, a Politico headline on Wednesday spoke volumes: ""Democratic Party in crisis."" Reporter Gabriel DeBenedetti asked: Is it the Clintons' party?  Or is it Obama's?  Or Elizabeth Warren's?  The reporter continued:Those questions are just the beginning. Is Obama's coalition of millennials, minorities, and women not enough, party operatives are now asking.  . . . Are working class white men out of the party's grasp forever?  Good questions, all.  Can the Democrats flourish without their historic base among the working class?Indeed, there does appear to be some genuine soul searching on the Democratic side: ""I had no idea how deep the divisions are, how real the pain is,"" Democratic strategist Paul Begala said on CNN. ""Donald Trump has given voice to some real spectacular pain on his side.""Where that soul-searching process will lead remains to be seen, and yet on Wednesday evening, a possible answer came poking through, as  Bernie Sanders weighed in with a new threat to the Democrats' stability.  Taking dead aim at the elitist, globalist, billionaire-ish, orientation of Obama-Clintonism, Sanders declared:Donald Trump tapped into the anger of a declining middle class that is sick and tired of establishment economics, establishment politics and the establishment media.  People are tired of working longer hours for lower wages, of seeing decent paying jobs go to China and other low-wage countries, of billionaires not paying any federal income taxes and of not being able to afford a college education for their kids--all while the very rich become much richer.And then Sanders added this kicker of a warning to Democrats:To the degree that Mr. Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him.To be sure, Sanders' statement was hardly a love letter to Trump; in the very next sentence, Sanders pledged to oppose Trump to the extent that the Vermonter judges him to be ""racist, sexist, xenophobic,"" etc.  And since we know that the Democrats have a hair-trigger when it comes to any violation of  PC orthodoxy, we can see that Sanders has given himself an easy out--if he wants it.Yet still, Sanders has put the Democrats Part on notice: The populist wing of the party is in a state of turmoil, as rank-and-file Democrats come to realize that the Corporatist-Multiculturalist-Green elite that has led the party for decades can't deliver the goods for ordinary working people.Thus the larger meaning of Sanders' statement is clear: If Trump can redeem his pledge to help the Forgotten Man and the Forgotten Woman, he and the Republicans will benefit, too, as the last working people in the Democratic Party turn out the lights on their ancestral political home.    And the Democrats know that they can't win with just street activists, enviros, and self-appointed ""social justice warriors.""Whew!  That's been a lot of ground to cover, but then, if time permitted, one could delineate 100 takeaways, not just 10.  And over time, time will permit.The poll's findings caused dismay--even outrage--among some readers, especially Democrats, who have denounced it and often criticized the Times for running it.Mr. Trump is the most unprepared president-elect in modern history.
