And the question is why not?"" said Channel 2's veteran police reporter Moshe Nussbaum. ""Maybe, and I say this cautiously, but maybe he could have been stopped.""Jerusalem's police chief Yoram Halevy defended the police's inaction by saying only that they were monitoring ""many potential attackers"" and the terrorist was ""one of those who certainly had the potential"" to carry out an attack.Halevy added that the attack could have been far worse were it not for heavy police presence in the area. The terrorist allegedly used an IDF issue M-16 machine-gun with ""lots and lots of ammunition,"" he said, and had he made it to the center of town, ""he would have killed lots of people.""However, Ya'ari maintained that the killer's rap sheet - including his renown as an inciter and the fact that he has been barred from the Temple Mount - should have kept the police on their toes. However, Israel's security apparatus, Ya'ari said, did not think the terrorist was ""about to make the transition from using his fists to using a machine-gun.""Ynet news reported that blame for the attack also lay with Israel's justice system. The terrorist should have already been in jail, but in 2015 his sentence was postponed despite having repeatedly failed to show up in court.The terrorist told independent Palestinian news agency Ma'an that he was intending to report to Ramle prison at 10am Sunday, the exact time he launched his killing spree.According to the report, failure to do so would mean facing imprisonment without trial.In the interview, the terrorist said he had been detained and released five times in the past two weeks, and was barred from entering east Jerusalem for a month.The attacker had been indicted on 15 counts of incitement to violence, and seven counts of supporting a terror organization, Channel 10 reported.Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan blamed social media sites like Facebook for not removing his posts, saying there was a direct link between the social media giant and terrorism.""Facebook and other social media have a direct responsibility,"" Erdan said after touring the site of Sunday's attack. He added that it was ""scandalous"" that Facebook had restored numerous Hamas-linked Facebook pages in the past two weeks ""because of Palestinian public pressure.""SIGN UP"

Twelve minutes? Whatever it was, of discussion of this ridiculous tape. Then it was clear as a bell that Donald Trump finally took control of the debate and the future of America and absolutely, in my view, wiped the floor with Hillary Clinton last night.""""I'm a little bit of an outlier on this issue, of this tape and what he said,"" Klein conceded. ""Yeah, it was crude. Yeah, it was vulgar. But you know, in my many, many years on this planet, I've heard from many men in public office a lot worse than what he said on that tape.

""And the fact that men who talk this way are somehow completely discredited, even though it is a centuries-old kind of banter, and boisterousness, and, quite frankly, boasting of prowess that quite frankly isn't true.""""Did it make Donald Trump look kind of bad? Yes, of course it did. But the very people, including many, many Republicans, who got on their high horse, their self-righteous high horses about this, are the same guys who turn on pornography when they are traveling in Marriott hotels, and who often sleep with their secretaries on Capitol Hill, and do many more, worse things than Donald Trump has done in his life,"" he said.""I'm not saying that Donald is pure as the driven snow. Donald himself would admit that he's far from pure as the driven snow ... and quite frankly, even you and I right now are spending too much time on it,"" Klein told Marlow.

She does her homework.""""But, for whatever reasons, she was not ready for Donald last night,"" he judged. ""There was this other thing that the New York Post captured on the front page of its paper today, which is his looming presence onstage while she was talking.

""I did not see one mainstream media outlet pick this up - or, for that matter, even check to see if I was accurate. Of course, I think I'm accurate because I interviewed the girls who did the foot rubs, and I interviewed the man who was at his party when he hosed down the women in this wet T-shirt contest. But nobody in the media has bothered to check and find out what I did, by simply going down to Little Rock and asking questions.""""So you can see this disgusting double standard that we are living with in this country, at a time when we can no longer afford to avoid truth,"" he declared, ""the truth of the Islamicization of the Western world, our economy going down the tubes, our position in the world - look at what happened just yesterday.

Yes, she deserved to be indicted.

She went on to say the NRA has ""intimidated"" Congress and state legislatures not simply into inaction on gun control but into ""passing the most absurd laws."" She particularly criticized open carry laws.She said the NRA is ""pernicious"" and has a ""corrupting influence,"" and talked of being proud of watching her husband go after the NRA via the 1994 ""assault weapons"" ban. She made clear that she will be going after SCOTUS in the same way. Clinton said, ""We've got to got after this. And here again, the Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment. And I am going to make that case every chance I get.""Although the audio recording offers no clarity as to where exactly Clinton believes SCOTUS got it ""wrong"" on the Second Amendment, Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin has since made it abundantly clear that Hillary's disagreement is with the District of Columbia v Heller (2008) decision. Heller was a reaffirmation that the Founding Fathers wrote the Second Amendment to protect a fundamental, individual right to keep and bear arms for self-defense.Clinton's disagreement with the Heller decision runs so deep that she twice refused to admit the right to bear arms is constitutional during the June 5 airing of This Week with George Stephanopoulos. When Stephanopoulos first asked her if the right to bear arms is constitutional, she would only obfuscate, saying:I think that for most of our history there was a nuanced reading of the Second Amendment, until the decision by the late Justice [Antonin] Scalia. And there was no argument until then that localities, and states, and the federal government had a right-as we do with every amendment-to impose reasonable regulations.Stephanopoulos followed up, pressing her to give a direct answer as to whether the right to bear arms is constitutional. Clinton said, ""If it is a constitutional right, then it-like every constitutional right-is subject to reasonable regulation.""AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

In reference to a tweet at close to 3 a.m., Cooper selectively repeated four words of one 25 word tweet:In 2008, you wrote in one of your books the most important characteristic of a good leader is discipline. You said if a leader doesn't have it ""He or she won't be one for very long."" In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape.

LOUIS, Missouri -- It wouldn't be Trumpian if there weren't any fireworks.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERDonald Trump, the 2016 GOP presidential nominee, crushed his Democratic opponent Hillary Rodham Clinton in Sunday evening's debate at Washington University in St. Louis--propelling him closer to the White House and past, perhaps, the roughest stretch of his campaign yet.""It was an absolute home run for Mr. Trump,"" Jason Miller, Trump's senior communications adviser, told Breitbart News in the spin room after the debate. ""This was a game-changing victory. You know what? The underdog is back.""Several key exchanges in the debate proved Trump to be the better candidate on Sunday night, the most important of which was when Trump forced out on his own with no help from moderators CNN's Anderson Cooper and ABC News' Martha Raddatz: when Trump said he would appoint a special and independent prosecutor to investigate the Clinton email scandal.Trump held his own through six straight questions with which Raddatz and others peppered him, opening the debate about the recently surfaced video of him using lewd language with former President George H.W. Bush's nephew Billy Bus; then when Hillary Clinton brought up the birther questions again--trying to force that into the conversation--Trump trapped her.""He [Trump] owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words,"" Clinton said, regarding the birther issue.After detailing how it is actually Hillary Clinton who owes President Obama an apology because she started the birther narrative--it's been proven that Clinton ally Sidney Blumenthal pushed the story back in the 2008 campaign, as did at least two people on Clinton's campaign--Trump shifted the conversation to questions about her emails.""But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing,"" Trump said, before dropping the mega-bomb: a special prosecutor to independently investigate Clinton. ""And I'll tell you what. I didn't think I'd say this, but I'm going to say it, and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it, and we're going to have a special prosecutor,"" Trump said, adding:When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this, where emails -- and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 emails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process. So we're going to get a special prosecutor, and we're going to look into it because you know what? People have been -- their lives have been -- destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you've done. And it's a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.After Clinton accused Trump of ""lies"" without detailing any, and as Raddatz attempted to intervene to save her, she begged the so-called ""fact checkers"" for help.""It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,"" she added.In response, Trump fired back his most aggressive and bold comeback all year: ""Because you'd be in jail.""Another key moment came when Raddatz tried to press Trump on his plan to temporarily halt Islamic migration into America from nations with terrorism problems. Hillary Clinton, in her previous answer--in a response to an Islamophobia question from an audience member--had attacked Trump over the Khan Gold Star family controversy again. Trump, in his reply to Raddatz's question, flipped the whole thing back on Clinton--who, unlike Trump, supported the war in Iraq.""First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today because, unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq. Iraq was a disaster,"" Trump said. ""So he would have been alive today.""""The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into an extreme vetting from certain areas of the world,"" Trump continued. ""Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands...""Raddatz then interrupted him.""Excuse me. Excuse me,"" Trump talked over her.""And why did it morph into that? No, did you -- no, answer the question. Do you still believe..."" Raddatz asked over Trump's talking.""Why don't you interrupt her? You interrupt me all the time,"" Trump asked Raddatz, speaking directly at the moderator.""I do,"" Raddatz said. ""Why don't you interrupt her?"" Trump followed up.The moderators interrupted Trump 26 times--and Clinton only 12 times--a clear and implicit bias by the legacy media anchors. ""Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands?"" Raddatz interjected again.""It's called extreme vetting,"" Trump said. He continued:We are going to areas like Syria where they're coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama. People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more. This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time. We have enough problems in this country. I believe in building safe zones. I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people. But I don't want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them. We know nothing about their values, and we know nothing about their love for our country.There were many other moments throughout the debate--from exchanges on Obamacare to more about refugees to dealing with Russia and Syria and even campaign finance--and Trump defeated Clinton on all of them. After the moderators could not stump Trump in the opening, and he steamrolled ahead in the early momentum, she could not catch a break all night.Trump's debate victory--which comes after a rough first debate with Clinton back on September 26, an eternity ago in this race, and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence's win last Tuesday in Virginia in the vice presidential debate against Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA)--puts perhaps the roughest stretch of his campaign behind him. A videotape of him making lewd remarks about women surfaced on Friday, and jittery establishment Republicans showed initial signs of a full-scale collapse of support for him. That was followed by an apology video late Friday night from Trump, a WikiLeaks document dump of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's personal emails, a rough-and-tumble, but effective, showing from several women who have accused Bill Clinton of allegedly raping or sexually assaulting them, and now this debate performance. With each of those developments and more, Trump seems to have put that stage of the campaign behind him and returned to the offensive position--riding high into political battle--moving into the final month of the campaign.The videotape threatened to derail Trump's campaign, as it prompted several senior Republicans to call on him to withdraw and hand the nomination away to his running mate or someone else. Trump has doubled down and refuses to quit on his supporters--and, sure enough, the tape found its way to center stage at the debate's opening. Trump was pressed on it a whopping six times before he finally--as he hinted he would before the debate when tweeting out video interviews that Bill Clinton's accusers did with Breitbart News, then appearing with them at an event here in Missouri--lit into Hillary Clinton for enabling Bill Clinton's behavior.But not only did Trump survive; he thrived. In the chaotic environment--as he described it as ""one on three,"" with the moderators working to help Clinton far more than to help him--Trump found his groove again and soared to a much-needed debate victory. The win not only stops the bleeding from a rough patch of the campaign, but propels him forward into the week like a cannonball onto the homestretch, with one final debate to go in Las Vegas a week from Wednesday. Miller, Trump's senior communications adviser, noted that Trump does his best with his back against the wall.""I think Donald Trump loves being the underdog, and this was fantastic,"" Miller told Breitbart News. ""I think what we saw tonight is a presidential leader in Donald Trump, who stepped up, is ready to lead, and that he's not going to back down to anybody. Hillary Clinton was rattled--completely rattled--the entire evening. She couldn't answer on crazy Obamacare. She couldn't answer on taxes. She couldn't answer on the emails. You could see everything, from her face was rattled to her inability to give clear answers to the voters who were there. I think if you're at home and you're watching, and you think about that person who is out there and what it would look like if she were across the table from a foreign leader, I'd be nervous that she wouldn't be able to stand up and defend this country. I think one candidate came across as very presidential tonight and that was Donald Trump.""
When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this, where emails -- and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 emails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process. So we're going to get a special prosecutor, and we're going to look into it because you know what? People have been -- their lives have been -- destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you've done. And it's a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.

We are going to areas like Syria where they're coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama. People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more.

SIGN UPDonald Trump, the 2016 GOP presidential nominee, crushed his Democratic opponent Hillary Rodham Clinton in Sunday evening's debate at Washington University in St. Louis--propelling him closer to the White House and past, perhaps, the roughest stretch of his campaign yet.""It was an absolute home run for Mr. Trump,"" Jason Miller, Trump's senior communications adviser, told Breitbart News in the spin room after the debate. ""This was a game-changing victory. You know what? The underdog is back.""Several key exchanges in the debate proved Trump to be the better candidate on Sunday night, the most important of which was when Trump forced out on his own with no help from moderators CNN's Anderson Cooper and ABC News' Martha Raddatz: when Trump said he would appoint a special and independent prosecutor to investigate the Clinton email scandal.Trump held his own through six straight questions with which Raddatz and others peppered him, opening the debate about the recently surfaced video of him using lewd language with former President George H.W. Bush's nephew Billy Bus; then when Hillary Clinton brought up the birther questions again--trying to force that into the conversation--Trump trapped her.""He [Trump] owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words,"" Clinton said, regarding the birther issue.After detailing how it is actually Hillary Clinton who owes President Obama an apology because she started the birther narrative--it's been proven that Clinton ally Sidney Blumenthal pushed the story back in the 2008 campaign, as did at least two people on Clinton's campaign--Trump shifted the conversation to questions about her emails.""But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing,"" Trump said, before dropping the mega-bomb: a special prosecutor to independently investigate Clinton. ""And I'll tell you what. I didn't think I'd say this, but I'm going to say it, and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it, and we're going to have a special prosecutor,"" Trump said, adding:When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this, where emails -- and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 emails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process. So we're going to get a special prosecutor, and we're going to look into it because you know what? People have been -- their lives have been -- After Clinton accused Trump of ""lies"" without detailing any, and as Raddatz attempted to intervene to save her, she begged the so-called ""fact checkers"" for help.""It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,"" she added.In response, Trump fired back his most aggressive and bold comeback all year: ""Because you'd be in jail.""Another key moment came when Raddatz tried to press Trump on his plan to temporarily halt Islamic migration into America from nations with terrorism problems. Hillary Clinton, in her previous answer--in a response to an Islamophobia question from an audience member--had attacked Trump over the Khan Gold Star family controversy again. Trump, in his reply to Raddatz's question, flipped the whole thing back on Clinton--who, unlike Trump, supported the war in Iraq.""First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today because, unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq. Iraq was a disaster,"" Trump said. ""So he would have been alive today.""""The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into an extreme vetting from certain areas of the world,"" Trump continued. ""Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands...""Raddatz then interrupted him.""Excuse me. Excuse me,"" Trump talked over her.""And why did it morph into that? No, did you -- no, answer the question. Do you still believe..."" Raddatz asked over Trump's talking.""Why don't you interrupt her? You interrupt me all the time,"" Trump asked Raddatz, speaking directly at the moderator.""I do,"" Raddatz said. ""Why don't you interrupt her?"" Trump followed up.The moderators interrupted Trump 26 times--and Clinton only 12 times--a clear and implicit bias by the legacy media anchors. ""Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands?"" Raddatz interjected again.""It's called extreme vetting,"" Trump said.

What's that supposed to prove?""The ""relationships"" that the women had with Bill Clinton allegedly included rape and violent sexual assault.""We were not willing participants,"" said rape accuser Juanita Broaddrick at a press conference preceding the debate. ""These were crimes.""Another accuser, Kathleen Willey, said: ""These are not infidelities. A rape is not an infidelity. These are crimes. Any other people would be in jail ...

The school, located in Arlington, Virginia, near the banks of the Potomac, will henceforth be called the Antonin Scalia Law School.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe university, which is named for the Father of the Bill of Rights, announced on March 31 its intention to name the school, after receiving a $20 million gift from an anonymous donor and another $10 million from the Charles Koch Foundation, on the condition that the law school be named in honor of the famed originalist scholar who served on the Court for almost 30 years. The gift also funds new scholarships and professorships at the law school.Justice Elena Kagan, the newest member of the Court, spoke on behalf of the entire Court at the dedication ceremony, lauding her departed colleague as a ""remarkable judge and teacher.""Scalia ""will go down in history as one of the most important Supreme Court justices ever, and one of the greatest,"" Kagan declared. ""He did nothing less than transform our legal culture.""The five other justices of the High Court present for the ceremony were Clarence Thomas, Anthony Kennedy, Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, and Sonia Sotomayor.Kagan's participation was rich with symbolism in at least two regards. First, as an appointee of a liberal Democrat, Kagan's warm and generous praise highlighted the camaraderie of the justices and the status they aspire to as a nonpolitical branch of government.Second, like Scalia, Kagan was a prominent law professor before being appointed to the bench. In fact, Kagan was the dean of Harvard Law School, the school where she earned her law degree and which was Scalia's alma mater, as well. (Scalia received his undergraduate degree from Georgetown.) So Kagan's approval carries with it the applause of academia, in recognition of Scalia's epic impact on legal philosophy.Scalia was a champion of originalism-that in our democratic form of government, the Constitution requires that all laws (including the Constitution itself) must be interpreted according to the original public meaning of their words, which would have been the meaning approved by the American people in adopting those words.Kagan knew Scalia before she joined the Court from his trips to Harvard Law School during her tenure as dean. After Kagan's confirmation, Scalia became a close friend, taking her on hunting trips and other activities that were new experiences for Kagan. This outreach reflected Scalia's approach to life and the ease with which he made friends, also seen in his close friendship with archliberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who shared a love of opera with Scalia.University President Angel Cabrera and law school dean Henry Butler also participated in the naming ceremony.Antonin Scalia passed away in his sleep during the nighttime hours of February 12 this year. He was 79.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News and a graduate of Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University. Follow him on Twitter @kenklukowski.SIGN UP"

But it also showed that Trump exceeded expectations, which impressed undecided voters.Frank Luntz's focus group of undecided voters on Fox News saw a massive shift away from Clinton and towards Trump, prompting him to declare: ""Tonight was so significant that Trump is back in this race.""Pollsters and pundits debate whether presidential debates actually affect the outcome of elections. Republicans took heart in 2012 when challenger Mitt Romney handily defeated President Barack Obama in their first debate. But the Obama campaign's data mining team claimed to have the election in the bag already, and Romney's poor performance in the remaining debates may simply have sealed his defeat.Still, Trump's strong showing on Sunday left a far different impression than Romney's performance in the second debate in 2012, when he yielded to Obama and moderator Candy Crowley on the Benghazi issue.The Las Vegas debate will be the candidates' last chance to make a strong impression on voters on a national stage. Once again, Trump will likely enjoy the benefit of low expectations, since the media are determined to deny him an outright victory in the second contest.But Las Vegas is home turf for Trump, and a gambling city loves the underdog.

They spoke on condition of anonymity because talks are ongoing.The pro-Western kingdom sealed its border with Syria in June, after a deadly cross-border attack claimed by Islamic State extremists killed seven members the Jordanian security forces. This has left more than 75,000 Syrians stuck between a war zone and a sealed border, without regular access to food, water and medicine.The displaced live in two makeshift tent camps in an area where the frontier is marked by two parallel low earthen walls, or berms. Conditions have become increasingly dire, with aid officials reporting the spread of disease, including whooping cough and hepatitis.Before the border closure, aid was sent from Jordanian soil. In August, Jordan permitted an aid drop by crane, in what was described at the time as a one-off shipment.U.N. agencies have since proposed setting up an aid distribution center between five and seven kilometers west of the largest encampment, known as Rukban, within the strip marked by the two berms, an aid official said. This would presumably have drawn the Syrians away from a Jordanian military base that is close to Rukban.However, Momani told The Associated Press on Monday that this is no longer being considered.""The new mechanism will be delivering aid on the berm through cranes, and the aid will be given to community leaders of groups of Syrians so they can distribute it accordingly,"" he said, adding it would be up to the aid agencies to decide on the pace of shipments.Momani said the border will remain sealed, citing an ongoing security threat to Jordan. The camps at the berm have been infiltrated by criminals, smugglers and extremists, he said.""You can describe part of it as a Daesh enclave,"" he said, referring to the extremist Islamic State group by its Arabic acronym.The two aid officials said nothing has been agreed on. One of the officials, who has direct access to the talks, said he was not aware of an emerging agreement on crane drops. He said another meeting was set for Tuesday.The suffering at the berm has caused some friction between Jordan and the international community.Aid agencies have been pressing for a resumption of aid from the Jordanian side.Jordan has said the international community needs to take responsibility for those stranded at the berm, and that the kingdom has already done more than its share in taking in Syrian refugees. In the past, Jordan has argued that this aid needs to come from Syrian territory, not Jordan.Momani said Jordan has taken the ""moral high ground"" by offering to help.Close to 5 million Syrians fled civil war in their country since 2011, including close to 660,000 who settled in Jordan.SIGN UP"

And both networks did their best to cover up for Clinton -- laughably so.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERCNN strained to defend Clinton by fact-checking Trump's ""acid wash"" statement -- and by fact-checking Clinton's response.CNN's Tom Foreman acknowledged the main facts Trump had presented -- that Clinton's team deleted her emails after they were under subpoena. That ought to have led to a ""true"" rating. But Foreman added that the FBI had not decided to charge Clinton with a crime because there was not enough evidence of ""collusion."" Therefore, he said, Trump's claim was false.Foreman continued by examining a statement by Clinton that ""there is no evidence that anyone can point to, at all ... that any classified materials ended up in the wrong hands.""Yet Congress heard sworn testimony, several times, that people with no security clearance at all -- from Clinton's lawyers, to the technicians who managed her server, to Bill Clinton aide Justin Cooper -- had access to her emails, including those with classified information.That should have been enough to rate the statement ""false."" But CNN rated it ""true.""NBC News actually fact-checked Trump's statement as if he had actually suggested that she used chemical acid to delete the emails on her server. It rated the claim false because ""Clinton's team used an app called BleachBit; she did not use a corrosive chemical.""FACT CHECK: Trump says Clinton ""acid washed"" her email server. She did not.

In broad comparison with the wider Federal Government, the federal workforce dedicated to our national security and foreign policy is - on average - less diverse, including at the highest levels.While the administration said the lack of diversity does not necessarily indicate the existence of barriers to equal employment opportunities, the memo highlights actions that will facilitate the inclusion of a more diverse federal workforce.In a blog post that accompanied Obama's memorandum, national security adviser Susan Rice, U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, Secretary of State John Kerry, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan, and USAID Administrator Gayle Smith highlighted the need for the U.S. national security workforce to draw from the strength of America's diversity.""Nearly 40 percent of the approximately 320 million people in the United States are minorities, and an increasing number of them are earning college and graduate degrees,"" blogged Rice. ""As America becomes more diverse, so do our best people. Yet, minorities make up less than 20 percent of our senior diplomats and 15 percent of senior military officers and senior intelligence officials.""While President Obama, the nation's first black president, attempted to make diversity a trademark of his tenure, black Americans and Hispanics experienced high unemployment rates during his presidency.Currently, more than three million military and civilian personnel in the U.S. Government are engaged in protecting the country and advancing our interests abroad, through diplomacy, development, defense, intelligence, law enforcement, and homeland security.
