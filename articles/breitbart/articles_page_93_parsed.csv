Subsidies for planes in the twin-aisle market cost the sale of 50 Boeing 767s, 777s and 787s. And subsidies to the A380 cost Boeing the sale of 54 747s. These represent crippling losses for Boeing, a crown jewel of U.S. manufacturing and a critical component of our national defense.Earlier, writes Boyle, the WTO ruled that, ""without the subsidies, Airbus would not have existed ... and there would be no Airbus aircraft on the market.""In ""The Great Betrayal"" in 1998, I noted that in its first 25 years the socialist cartel called Airbus Industrie ""sold 770 planes to 102 airlines but did not make a penny of profit.""Richard Evans of British Aerospace explained: ""Airbus is going to attack the Americans, including Boeing, until they bleed and scream."" And another executive said, ""If Airbus has to give away planes, we will do it.""When Europe's taxpayers objected to the $26 billion in subsidies Airbus had gotten by 1990, German aerospace coordinator Erich Riedl was dismissive, ""We don't care about criticism from small-minded pencil-pushers.""This is the voice of economic nationalism. Where is ours?[...]In the U.S. trade picture, even in the darkest of times, the brightest of categories has been commercial aircraft.But to watch how we allow NATO allies we defend and protect getting away with decades of colluding and cheating, and then to watch Boeing transfer technology and outsource critical manufacturing to rivals like Japan, one must conclude that not only is the industrial decline of the United States inevitable, but America's elites do not care.As for our corporate chieftains, they seem accepting of what is coming when they are gone, so long as the salary increases, stock prices and options, severance packages, and profits remain high.By increasingly relying upon foreign nations for our national needs, and by outsourcing production, we are outsourcing America's future.Read the rest here.

Ochoa said. The findings were released while the administration was facing charges of slow-walking open records requests for Hillary Clinton's emails, as well as other requests.In the case of Judicial Watch, the order to strip it of media status came from political operatives with long ties to Democratic causes -- and even from the White House.The inspector general said the decision came at the behest of Gregory Mecher, a former Democratic campaign fundraiser who at the time was liaison to the White House. He is married to Jen Psaki, a longtime spokeswoman with the Obama administration and its election campaigns.Ms. Ochoa said stripping Judicial Watch of media status violated several agency policies and things got worse when the GSA denied an appeal by the group.The same person who ruled on the initial request also ruled on the appeal, ""contrary to GSA procedures,"" the inspector general said.Luckily for President Obama and his minions, laws and regulations no longer have any meaning to those in power, so they faced no consequences worse than waiving some fees and forking over a $750 settlement (not $750 million; just $750) after Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit.The Washington Times tells the story of how Judicial Watch was stripped of its media classification:The group was trying to get a look at a goofy video produced by the agency's New York office on company time and using company resources. The GSA at the time was facing fierce criticism from Capitol Hill for having wasted money on lavish conferences with questionable team-building activities such as the video.Judicial Watch asked to be treated similar to a member of the media, which would mean an exemption from fees. Two weeks earlier, Judicial Watch was approved for the media exemption.But ahead of the GSA request, Mr. Mecher, the political appointee with ties to the White House, requested that Judicial Watch's status be re-examined, investigators said. Elliot Mincberg, a lawyer with deep Democratic ties who was on loan to the GSA at the time, issued a determination rejecting Judicial Watch as a media requester.Ms. Ochoa said the justification for that was weak -- a page from a Justice Department guide that predated the current law governing the definition of media. Mr. Mincberg ""did not conduct any independent legal research"" about the 2007 law, and that ""shows a lack of due diligence,"" Ms. Ochoa concluded.The GSA then failed to follow its own procedures in its denial letter -- despite internal misgivings -- and again in mishandling the appeal, Ms. Ochoa wrote.""Why are White House liaisons involved in our FOIA request?"" said Mr. Fitton, the Judicial Watch president.""It's outrageous but not surprising. Welcome to our world. This is what we put up with all the time from the agencies,"" Fitton sighed to the Washington Times.As with the IRS scandal, try to imagine this was a Republican administration sending drones to harass a liberal group, especially a highly effective liberal group. The president of that group would not be left to quietly bemoan his misfortune in a single interview. There would be a four-alarm fire at every news organization in the country.The Inspector General report concluded that, generally speaking, the GSA was actually better than many other agencies at handling FOIA requests. Other departments often complain the burden of complying with FOIA is excessive - a debatable assertion given the wealth of the federal government, the staggering number of people it employs, and the power of modern information technology.But even if we concede the point, it stands as a rebuke of mega-government, not a defense. If the government is so big that transparency is impractical, then either it needs to be smaller, or politicians must be more honest with the public about how much transparency we can expect.Incidentally, that ""lawyer with deep Democratic ties who was on loan to the GSA at the time,"" Elliott Mincberg, wound up at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, where he was cited for obstructing an investigation into the deputy secretary by ""withholding information from investigators, appearing to coach witnesses and, during one interview, threatening to bring charges against the investigators themselves.""The GSA botched several high-profile open records requests, delaying them for months while political appointees got involved, Inspector General Carol F.

5	5	http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/09/30/james-pinkerton-the-democrats-vs-the-deplorables-part-two-the-immigration-flashpoint/	James Pinkerton – The Democrats vs. The Deplorables, Part Two: The Immigration Flashpoint 	"In an earlier article, ""The Democrats vs. The Deplorables: The New Class Struggle Comes to the Midwest,"" this author detailed the Democrats' systematic campaign against the interests of American energy workers, many of them unionized--a curious stance for the presumed party of working people and labor unions. In this piece, I will outline an even more curious stance: the Democrats' systematic campaign against American border security and American sovereignty.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROf course, I've had plenty of help from my colleagues here at Breitbart. Anyone familiar with this publication knows that it has closely chronicled the deleterious impact of unlimited immigration, legal and illegal, on American life.Breitbart has reported on the damage done to America by immigrant crime and terrorism. It has also accounted for the negative impact of open borders on workers' incomes, national security, and epidemic disease.Moreover, as a stalwart champion of American sovereignty--that is, the right of American citizens to determine what's best for America--Breitbart has argued that we can yet control our national destiny. After all, border fences have worked to keep Israel safe, even as similar security fences are finally, in the wake of the refugee influx, going up all over Europe.Closer to home, Breitbart has closely watched the domestic politics of immigration. One particularly contentious issue is the federal program known as DACA, or Delayed Action for Childhood Arrivals.DACA was never enacted by Congress; it originated in 2012 as a unilateral executive order from the Obama administration, which has aggressively championed DACA ever since. As Breitbart has reported in hundreds of articles, DACA is a costly amnesty program for young illegal aliens.Another hot issue is the resettlement of Syrian refugees--almost all of them Sunni Muslim--into the U.S. Most Americans oppose this policy, which also was never approved by Congress. Yet even so, the resettlement continues, even accelerates, across the nation; whereas the target for Syrian refugees in fiscal year 2016 was 10,000, the actual number moved in was 12,430--an overrun of more than 24 percent.Such resettlement has costs--and not just financial costs. In Twin Falls, Idaho, for example, a horrendous crime allegedly occurred earlier this year; a five-year-girl was sexually assaulted by three Muslim refugees--all of them and their families resettled, to be sure, at taxpayer expense. In the course of more than 20 pieces on various aspects of that scandalous facilitation of criminality, Breitbart has delineated not only the crime, but also the astonishing cover-up by local authorities.Moreover, readers here have learned that a new multi-billion-dollar industry has been created--that is, the myriad taxpayer-subsidized NGOs across the country that specialize in putting refugees into local communities.  This entire archipelago of agencies might be dubbed Refugee, Inc.Meanwhile, Obama's anointed would-be successor in the White House, Hillary Clinton, has pledged to keep going with DACA and the entirety of the Obama open-borders agenda--and, indeed, to accelerate it. Hence this Breitbart headline from June: ""Census Data: 10 Million New Immigrants to Enter U.S. During President Hillary Clinton's First Term.""Others on the left are eagerly joining the open-borders push. The American Civil Liberties Union is now promoting the notion that America's taking control of its borders is somehow unconstitutional. In addition, the untrammeled flow of refugees has long been the main focus of George Soros, the mega-plutocrat who has spent billions to build up left-wing pressure groups. So we can see where the immigration issue is headed if Clinton wins this November.To be sure, there's another side to the story, and Breitbart has covered that, too. As everyone knows, Donald Trump's signature issue has been the reassertion of American national control over the U.S.-Mexican border, and, yes, building a wall.Moreover, Trump has been vocal on the issue of U.S. sovereignty. Indeed, he has endeavored to personalize that somewhat abstract issue; he has met many times with Angel Moms, the mothers of those murdered by illegals, and spoken forcefully on their behalf. So it's little wonder that those public employees still determined to actually enforce our border laws have endorsed Trump.Okay, so that's the political lay of the land. Yet there's a deeper question: What are the intellectual foundations of this controversy? As they say, ideas have consequences, and all around us, we're seeing the consequences.So let's ask: How did we get to this point--the point where the West is under siege? (We know, of course, that refugees and migrants are not an issue in other parts of the world, such as Asia, for the simple reason that Asian countries won't let them in.)Specifically, how did we--more precisely, the American elite--abandon the old idea that America should be one country, patriotic and secure, and instead take up the new idea that America should be globalist and insecure? In that vein, how did we end up with a Secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, who throws up his hands and admits that terrorist attacks, including homegrown terrorist attacks, are ""the new normal""?Without a doubt, the Founding Fathers would be horrified at what's happening to America in the 21st century. After all, the Preamble of their revered document, the U.S. Constitution, is decisive on this point: The new federal government will ""insure domestic tranquility"" and ""provide for the common defense.""And here's Alexander Hamilton, going further, arguing that national unity is the key to national security:The safety of a republic depends essentially on the energy of a common National sentiment; on a uniformity of principles and habits; on the exemption of the citizens from foreign bias, and prejudice; and on that love of country which will almost invariably be found to be closely connected with birth, education and family.Of course, circumstances changed, and in the 19th century, waves of immigration came to America, seeking honest work and opportunity--legal immigration, we might stipulate.Thus America became known as the ""melting pot""--that is, the crucible in which peoples from around the world, but mostly Europe, came here to be made into English-speaking Americans.Such ""patriotic assimilation,"" as it was once quaintly called, proved to be a challenge, as the country was riven by ethnic and industrial unrest. And yet the elites of that era were equal to the challenge: They had an inclusive vision of the United States that included newcomers, even while at the same time holding them to the high standard of Americanism. And that's why, for example, the Pledge of Allegiance emerged in 1892; it was a symbolic tool, a way of uniting disparate peoples around a common civic liturgy.So when Donald Trump said in Cleveland this summer, ""Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo,"" he was well within the greater American historical tradition of nation-building at home.Yet to many, probably most, in the elite today, Trump's language, and the sentiments it evokes, are deemed to be hopelessly antiquated and obsolete. In fact, they are often judged to be worse than that--as racist, chauvinist, and hegemonist.In New York, D.C. and other islands of blue enlightenment across the country, the question is asked: Who are we to impose our will on anyone else? What gives us the right to propagate traditional values--even such values as women's rights--on the ""authentic"" culture of Third Worlders?Such views are by no means confined to professors in their ivory towers, or to think-tank scribblers in their cubicles, or to foundation heads in their tax-exempt suites, or to donors in their penthouses: it is now the common discourse of the Democratic Party.We can be very specific about this: In 2003, Hillary's husband, the 42nd president, laid out his vision for the world; here's the Breitbart headline: ""Bill Clinton Calls For Creation of 'Global Community': 'America Has Greater Obligations to Open Our Borders.'"" In that speech at Yale University, Clinton declared,I think the great mission of the 21st century is to create a genuine global community, to move from mere interdependence to integration, to a community that has shared responsibilities, shared benefits and shared values.Lest anyone miss his point, Clinton got more specific, asserting that ""open borders"" and ""easy immigration"" were two of the ""forces of interdependence""--the interdependence that Clinton sees as central to the global community he yearns for.We can quickly point out that the US has a population of around 320 million, while the population of the world is more than seven billion. Moreover, most of the world's politics and culture are, shall we say, a good bit different from that of the US.  So to the extent that the world is ""integrated""--that is, reduced to common denominators--it's safe to say that what used to be called, with justifiably patriotic pride, American Exceptionalism is doomed. (And also, of course, the once exceptionally high American standard of living.)Yet for some, the submergence of America in the global soup isn't an accident--it's the intended goal. And why is this?  It all goes back to ideas--consequential ideas. So here we can pause to note that ""exceptionalism,"" like ""Americanism,"" is, to be literal about it, an ""ism.""Thus we can see the intellectual roots of the elite campaign against the once-dominant idea of Americanism: In the progressive mind, exceptionalism and Americanism are simply isms, period. And to the left of today, all isms are automatically bad.Here too, Breitbart has grappled with these questions; this website has argued that innocent words, such as patriotism and nationalism, have wrongly been conflated with ""racism,"" ""sexism,"" and so on. And that conflation has taken some on an ""ideological conveyor belt that ends in 'fascism.'""So we can see: To the progressive mind, patriotism and nationalism are simply ""gateway drugs"" to even more wicked isms.As an aside, we can observe that this slippery-slope thinking would be confounding to such Democratic patriots as Presidents Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Harry Truman. Each was regarded as a progressive in his respective era, even if, from the perspective of today, they seem more on the right than the left--they were, after all, in favor of jobs for blue collars and other ""deplorables."" And perhaps most notably, for all three of them, when international trouble came unbidden, they were mightily resolved to mobilize the full force of Americanism against fearful enemies.Indeed, as far as they were concerned, the only way that America could succeed militarily was through the invocation of patriotic fervor and national unity. As FDR said on December 8, 1941, the day after Pearl Harbor,Always will our whole nation remember the character of the onslaught against us.  No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory. . . . With confidence in our armed forces, with the unbounding determination of our people, we will gain the inevitable triumph-so help us God.Why, to read those words today, one could be forgiven for thinking that FDR was a Republican! And it would seem that Democrats have noticed just that: There's a reason that today's Democrats rarely talk about Wilson, Roosevelt, and Truman. They were, after all, white heterosexual males, sitting at the pinnace of ""intersectional"" privilege.For those who might be curious, intersectionalism is the politically correct ideology that discerns everything through the filter of racial, gender, and sexual oppression. In this telling, straight white males are on top (although such would be news to victims of affirmative action and racial quotas). Next in line, depending on the intersectionalist adjudicator, are straight white women--or maybe it's gay white men, in which case, straight white women are reduced by  another notch. Then we go down a dolorous hierarchy of discrimination and injustice, until we get to the faces at the bottom of the well, namely, gay women of color.  These distinctions might seem alien, or just plain silly, to most Americans, and yet they are at the core of many college curriculums; in recent years, they have fired up millions of Social Justice Warriors.So can readily see: In this sort of PC intellectual climate, Dead White Males, even Democratic DWMs, don't have much of a chance. (And of course, memories of even earlier Democratic presidents, such as Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, and James K. Polk, has long ago been purged; they were, after all, straight white male slaveowners who fought Indians and Mexicans.)So now to today's Democrats. After having consigned most of their party's heritage down the memory hole, what are the influences that shape them? Who are their new heroes? Let's take a look:We know that Barack and Michelle Obama spent 15 years listening to the sermons of the ardently anti-American preacher Rev. Jeremiah Wright, famous for saying, ""Not God bless America, God damn America.""And we know that on February 18, 2008, Michelle Obama was moved to say, ""For the first time in my adult lifetime, I am really proud of my country."" (She was born in 1964.)In the opinion of conservative classicist Victor Davis Hanson, President Obama is a harsh judge of America--even after it elected him twice to the presidency:On his recent Asian tour, President Obama characterized his fellow Americans (the most productive workers in the world) as ""lazy.""In fact, he went on to deride Americans for a list of supposed transgressions ranging from the Vietnam War to environmental desecration to the 19th century treatment of Native Americans.Hanson went on to observe that Obama has publicly sided with the memory of the late mugger Trayvon Martin and also, more recently, the anti-American football player Colin Kaepernick.So now the picture of the emerging Democratic ideology is coming into focus. Thus Hillary Clinton's famous recent rant to Democratic donors seems to be perfectly part of the pattern:You can put half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables.  Right?  Racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic, you name it.So now we can begin to define Clinton's worldview: On the one side, the admirables--the globalist integrators. On the other side, the deplorables--racists, sexists, xenophobes, and Islamophobes. In her mind, it's a profoundly necessary battle; it's really, in fact, a struggle of the good (plus Goldman Sachs) against the evil. And so it's easy to see why she and her allies seek more immigration; they need the additional numbers to crush her enemies.Under pressure politically, Clinton expressed regret for those revealing ""deplorable"" remarks, and yet unsurprisingly, just two weeks later, she was right back at it.  In her September 26 debate against Donald Trump, she took aim at what she called ""implicit bias""--thereby taking aim at all Americans:I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police. . . . But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.To be sure, Clinton said that ""everyone"" is guilty of implicit bias, thus implicating herself and her fellow progressives, albeit in a highly non-specific way.Still, the notion that we're all guilty is a key part of progressive thinking. In fact, in its self-questioning inwardness, progressivism is akin to philosophy, even theology. Yes, that's a safe enough statement: In its all-encompassing totality, progressivism is a kind of secular religion. And so just as Christians believe that everyone is a sinner, well, so do secular progressives. The difference, of course, is that a Christian seeks forgiveness from God, while a  a progressive might seek absolution by resolving not to think implicitly biased thoughts, and, of course, by  spending more tax money on immigrants.Yet in the meantime, the everyone-is-guilty mantra is politically precious to the left, because it advances the notion that all extant institutions are inherently racist--and thus justifying massive legal and political intervention to ""fix"" them.Of course, some might conclude that an endless battle against such a free-form concept as ""implicit bias"" is really just a recipe for an endless battle against human nature. Others might wonder if one can retrain, for example, the police and still keep the crime rate down. And still others might be curious to know if such ""fixing"" is really the best plan for growing the economy, creating jobs, competing with the world, and defending ourselves against Iran, Russia, and China.And finally, some will ask if America can declare itself adamantly opposed to implicit bias while still keeping a level head about border- and national security. That is, if the new progressive ideology tells us to oppose anything that anyone on the left could label as ""racist""--that is, any institution that purportedly perpetuates the patriarchy of pale people--then just about every institution must be toppled. And that must-be-toppled category includes such vestiges of the old ways as national borders.So once again, it's the Democrats against the Deplorables--we can give ourselves a capital ""D,"" since, thanks to Clinton, we now have a common identity. Still, as we all know, in the context of this election, the Democrats vs. Deplorables fight is a close match; indeed, the latest polls show Clinton slightly ahead.And yet the Deplorables have been awakened. So no matter what happens this November, our ranks are sure to grow, because their 2016 vote notwithstanding, in the end, the vast majority of Americans want this country to survive, not to be globalized into some progressive world order.Indeed, in the years to come, we will likely discover that the ghosts of such scorned old-fashioned Democrats as Jefferson, Jackson, Wilson, FDR, and Truman--those white patriots, now deemed to be politically incorrect, maybe even Deplorable--are marching, as well, at our side.And thus, with thoughtful and far-seeing coalition management, we can see the makings of a big center-right political army. That is, it's possible to envision an alliance of present-day Republican voters, plus old-fashioned Democrats, all arrayed in formation against the new progressive Obama-Clinton Democrats.If so, if then the Social Justice Warriors, currently riding high on their stallions of self-righteousness, will be in for a hard and resounding fall.The safety of a republic depends essentially on the energy of a common National sentiment; on a uniformity of principles and habits; on the exemption of the citizens from foreign bias, and prejudice; and on that love of country which will almost invariably be found to be closely connected with birth, education and family.I think the great mission of the 21st century is to create a genuine global community, to move from mere interdependence to integration, to a community that has shared responsibilities, shared benefits and shared values.Always will our whole nation remember the character of the onslaught against us.  No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory. . . .

In fact, there are so many foreign workers in those three states that there's a semi-hidden job network to help them apply for jobs ahead of American professionals.The huge extra supply of foreign university labor, according to the law of supply and demand, pushes down the salaries earned by American professionals in those states. Nationwide, this so-called ""immigration tax"" annually transfers $500 billion away from blue-collar and white-collar Americans towards employers, Wall Street, and new immigrants, according to a Harvard analysis.So far, Donald Trump has made only a few direct appeals to this upper income group of university voters. But those voters can provide him with the few extra points of support he needs to win those critical Midwestern states. A September 2016 poll by Monmouth University, for example, shows Trump was viewed favorably by just 29 percent of college voters. In contrast, he is viewed favorably by 51 percent of people with some college education, and by 47 percent of people with High School qualifications. Clinton has repeatedly spoken out in favor of the unpopular outsourcing program, to audiences in the United States and to audiences in India, which provides much of the manpower for H-1B outsourcing contracts all over the country. Once elected as a New York Senator, she also helped Indian outsourcing companies grab more jobs in the United States, despite opposition from some other senators, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.""I am reaffirming my commitment to the H-1B visa and increasing the current cap,"" she said in 2007 to an audience of tech-industry donors.""It is an inevitability. There is no way to legislate against reality, so I think the outsourcing will continue,"" she said on a 2005 visit to India.Clinton is also continuing President Barack Obama's strategy of offering more H-1B workers to companies if they pressure the GOP to provide an amnesty to millions of unskilled illegal immigrants. That strategy, which trades away the careers of white-collar professionals to get more immigrant voters for the Democratic Party, was defeated in 2014 when the GOP's base voters blocked Obama's so-called ""Comprehensive Immigration Reform"" plan. That plan had offered companies a new supply of blue-collar guest workers, plus an unlimited supply of work-permits for foreign graduates of U.S. colleges, in exchange for their lobbying the GOP to approve an amnesty at least 11 million illegal immigrants. On June 22, Clinton told Vox.com:The idea of a comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship that I would envision is one that would deal with a lot of these concerns, not just the 11 million people here ... But I don't want to mix that with other kinds of changes in visas and other concerns that particularly high-value technical companies have. In fact, I think keeping the pressure on the [companies] helps us resolve the bigger [amnesty] problem, and then we can look to see what else, if anything, can and should be done.Her campaign platform also promises to let universities sell an unlimited number of Green Cards -- and thus citizenship -- to tuition-paying foreign students. The open-borders promise to foreign graduates is posted at her campaign site and is titled ""Hillary Clinton's Initiative on Technology & Innovation.""As part of a comprehensive immigration solution, Hillary would ""staple"" a green card to STEM masters and PhDs from accredited institutions--enabling international students who complete degrees in these fields to move to green card status.Clinton also supported greater white-collar outsourcing while she was Secretary of State. In fact, her own Clinton Foundation used the H-1B program to hire up to 130 foreign graduates, from 2004 to 2016, instead of hiring Americans.Overall, ""her past statements in support of H-1B visas, and her silence in this campaign even when Bernie Sanders criticised her for her past support of H-1B visas, mean that she will probably support the H-1B visa programme if she is elected president,"" according to Cyrus Mehta, an immigration lawyer on Wall Street. If elected, she ""will push Congress in the direction of expanding rather than curtailing the H-1B visa,"" he wrote in May.In contrast, Trump has repeatedly called for rules that protect Americans from cheap foreign labor. He argues that immigration rules should help Americans, not companies or investors.Hillary Clinton's open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all Americans - and make everyone less safe.-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 21, 2016That plan on his website would raise Americans' wages and reduce unemployment, complained one of Clinton's Wall Street supporters, Mark Zandi.In May, Trump also produced a plan to reform the H-1B program so that it doesn't outsource Americans' jobs. The plan promised to:Increase prevailing wage for H-1Bs. We graduate two times more Americans with STEM degrees each year than find STEM jobs, yet as much as two-thirds of entry-level hiring for IT jobs is accomplished through the H-1B program. More than half of H-1B visas are issued for the program's lowest allowable wage level, and more than eighty percent for its bottom two. Raising the prevailing wage paid to H-1Bs will force companies to give these coveted entry-level jobs to the existing domestic pool of unemployed native and immigrant workers in the U.S., instead of flying in cheaper workers from overseas. This will improve the number of black, Hispanic and female workers in Silicon Valley who have been passed over in favor of the H-1B program. Mark Zuckerberg's personal Senator, Marco Rubio, has a bill to triple H-1Bs that would decimate women and minorities.Requirement to hire American workers first. Too many visas, like the H-1B, have no such requirement. In the year 2015, with 92 million Americans outside the workforce and incomes collapsing, we need companies to hire from the domestic pool of unemployed. Petitions for workers should be mailed to the unemployment office, not USCIS.White-collar professionals would prefer such a policy in the Midwest, where a July poll showed that the voters are the most outspoken against companies hiring foreigners instead of Americans.According to the complex H-1B rules, U.S. companies don't have to interview Americans for jobs before hiring an foreign worker with an H-1B visa. Also, the annual cap on imported H-1B visas is apparently 85,000, but non-profits -- including universities and company research centers -- are exempt from the cap, so they can many more H-1Bs visas. Also, H-1B visas can be extended beyond can stay longer than six years and also convert their H-1Bs into Green Cards, so many foreign professionals stay in the United States far longer than the supposed six-year limit on H-1B visas. In 2013 ""nearly 102,000 Asian immigrants obtained green cards through employment-based immigrant visa petitions,"" according to a White House statement.The growing role of foreign white-collar workers is a national trend that is already reducing salaries for Americans professionals. Almost 20 percent of legal immigrants who have arrived since 2010 have post-graduate degrees,  compared to 11 percent of Americans, according to a new survey of government data by the Center for immigration Studies. For example, foreign born professionals now make up one-quarter of the prestigious computer software business, according to the CIS report. Predictably, ""wages have remained flat, with [after-inflation] real wages hovering around their late 1990s levels, said a 2013 report by by the Economic Policy Institute. But foreign-born professionals now comprise 21 percent of the science sector, 27 percent of doctors and surgeons, 19 percent of architects and engineers, 15 percent of nurses, 14 percent of financial specialists, says the center -- which also notes that foreign-born only comprise 5 percent of English-language reporters and 7 percent of lawyers. The threat to American professionals' salaries and jobs has been heightened by a steady stream of media articles about H-1B outsourcing. These articles have described the outsourcing of  jobs held by accountants at McDonalds' headquarters, engineers at Caterpillar; software experts at Abbot Laboratories, Disney, California Edison, and the University of California at San Francisco; and by professors, doctors and scientists at universities and hospitals all around the country.Unsurprisingly, the inflow of foreign professionals is helping to push down the salaries for even the best educated Americans. That trend is following the downward path of American blue-collar workers, whose wages have been shriveled by the huge inflow of unskilled illegal immigrants.The Breitbart analysis of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania used government data posted at the MyVisaJobs.com site to show that the H-1B program has gradually imported a resident population of at least 100,000 foreign graduates Those graduates are now working in a wide variety of jobs, including as doctors and designers, professors and teachers, scientists, marketing experts, accountants, pharmacists, therapists, and software experts.The 1oo,000 total includes the current three-state population of roughly 40,000 people now holding six-year H-1B visas, plus roughly 75,000 foreign-born ""guest worker"" professionals whose American employers helped them get Green Cards to stay in the United States, and to eventually become citizens. Pennsylvania now has roughly 18,000 H-1Bs, including 4,200 working at prestigious universities and non-profit research centers. Also, 33,000 foreign workers have gotten Green Cards since 1990 from their employers in the state. Michigan has a population of roughly 16,000 H-1B workers, including roughly 2,600 H-1Bs working at universities and research centers. Also, Michigan employers have won up to 32,000 Green Cards for their foreign workers since 1990. Wisconsin has a resident population of roughly 6,000 H-1B foreign professionals, including 1,000 H-1Bs working at the state's universities and non-profit research centers. In addition, companies have applied for 10,000 Green Cards for foreign workers since 1990. That adds up to a resident population of 40,000 H-1B workers, including 7,800 working at universities and non-profit centers, plus 75,000 foreign professionals who have gotten Green Cards. Assuming one-sixth of the Green Card applicants failed to complete their certified process or have since left the three states, then the guest-worker program has now placed 100,000 foreign professionals in those three states. Wisconsin has 10 votes in the Electoral College, Pennsylvania has 20 votes, and Michigan has 16 votes. A win in any one of those states could give Trump the keys to the White House.Nationwide, there are roughly 650,000 resident H-1B workers, including almost 100,000 employed by U.S. colleges, and roughly 13,000 in Ohio.The H-1Bs are attractive to employers because they're cheaper than American graduates. For example, the University of Wisconsin at Madison is using the H-1B program to hire foreign professionals for salaries under $62,000 a year. ""We currently have 250 H-1B employees,"" Meredith McGlone, a spokeswoman for the university told Breitbart.Companies are also creating non-profit centers to help them bring in more lower-wage foreign professionals instead of hiring higher-wage American graduates. For example, Dow Chemical and its subsidiaries asked to hire 39 new H-1B workers in 2015, including environmental engineers, marketing managers, statisticians, and scientists.Because they are technically being hired by a ""cap exempt"" non-profit, none of these 39 H-1Bs were counted against the supposed annual cap of 85,000 H-1B workers.Dow Chemical did not respond to Breitbart News. The three-state total of 100,000 foreign professionals excludes the ""Optional Practical Training"" program, which provides work visas to foreign college grads. In late 2015, roughly 120,000 foreign students were using the OPT visa to apply for jobs sought by American graduates. The 1oo,000 calculation also excludes the several hundred thousand foreign professionals with L visas now working in the United States. In 2013, 66,700 L visas were issued to foreign professionals, allowing them to work in the United State for up to seven years. There's no upper limit on the number of L visas issued each year, so the number of L Visa workers may exceed 400,000, with perhaps 20,000 working in the three midwestern states. The numbers of H-1B and Green Card professionals comes from the MyVisaJobs.com site, which tracks the inflow and transfer of H-1B workers, plus the number of Green Cards that companies apply for on behalf of their foreign professionals. The estimated population of 100,000 foreign-born college graduates in the three states has created a semi-hidden job market for foreign graduates.These sites, including MyVisaJobs, DesiOPT, and OPTnation, include many job offerings from Indian-run companies in the United States. Jobs are also advertised to OPT and H-1B workers via the Indeed.com website, and on foreign sites, such as Jobisjob in India, while U.S.-based job coaches help foreign professionals snag good jobs.Many of the job ads are posted by third-party staffing companies, especially in the medical sector or the software business, who rent their employees to other companies.The MyVisaJobs.com site offers quick links to job openings at Pennsylvania companies that hire H-1B professionals.In Philadelphia, many of the posted jobs are for H-1B hires at Deloitte Consulting. Those jobs could be filled by American graduates from mainstream business schools.DeLoitte did not respond to emails from Breitbart News. How Breitbart News Calculated the Number of Foreign Professionals in the Three States. The final count was accomplished in several steps. The site also displays all the petitions for Green Cards that are submitted by employers on behalf of their foreign employees. One page invites visitors to ""Search permanent Labor Certifications(LC) filed under PERM for employment based Green Card petitions. Hundred of new cases are added to the database every day, after Department of Labor makes final decisions."" The number of resident H-1B workers was calculated by first combining data from 2013 to 2015 on the number of certified requests by for-profit companies to get a H-1B visa for a new foreign hire. That number was then divided by three because only about one-third of approved requests are granted a H-1B visa.Then Breitbart News added up the number of visas requested in those years by universities and non-profits, such as hospitals. These requests don't count against the annual cap, so they're routinely approved. Breitbart then added the number of certified ""continuation"" visa requests in 2013, 2014, and 2015. Those continuation visas are routinely granted to H-1B workers who have used up their first three-year visa. These continuation visas are also exempt from the cap.Breitbart News cannot track the number of H-1B, L or OPT visa holders, or of Green Card winners, in the three states who may have moved to or from other American states. The idea of a comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship that I would envision is one that would deal with a lot of these concerns, not just the 11 million people here ... But I don't want to mix that with other kinds of changes in visas and other concerns that particularly high-value technical companies have.

John Podesta previously served as White House counselor under the Obama administration and helped to direct President Obama's 2008 transition into the White House. He is founder of the heavily influential Center for American Progress.Besides his family ties, Tony Podesta has been a major financial bundler for Clinton's campaign, raising $268,000 as of July.Tony's wife, also a lobbyist, raised $407,000 for the campaign.One major focus of Tony Podesta's work has been Ukraine, a policy issue of enormous consequence to U.S. national security.On June 11, 2012, the Podesta Group registered to lobby for the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine, which has been described in numerous major news media reports as an operation heavily tied to the pro-Russian politician Viktor Yanukovych, who served as president of Ukraine from February 2010 until February 2014.In February 2014, when Yanukovych rejected a European Union trade agreement and instead favored $15 billion in Russian financing, the Ukrainian leader was faced with mass protests and fled the country for Russia. As a result, the Ukrainian parliament voted to oust him as president.The Podesta Group has not responded to three Breitbart News requests for comment about the specifics of its activities in lobbying for the Centre beyond the few generalities offered in previous media reports.Eight months after the Podesta Group took on the Centre as a client, Hillary Clinton on February 4, 2012, met with Yanukovych in Munich, Germany.The Podesta Group did not respond to a Breitbart News request for information about whether Podesta helped to set up that meeting.In December 2013, Reuters reported that ""among the high-profile lobbyists registered to represent organizations backing Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich's government are prominent Democratic lobbyist Anthony Podesta and former Republican congressional leaders Vin Weber and Billy Tauzin.""Reuters found that from 2012 to December 2013, Podesta's firm was paid $900,000 to do lobby work for the European Centre.Speaking to the news agency, Podesta described in general terms some of what he said he was his work for the Centre.Reuters reported:Podesta said in a phone interview that he and his counterparts at Mercury have been contacting U.S. legislators to argue that approving the pro-Tymoshenko measures would only complicate efforts to improve relations between Ukraine and the West, including the European Union.Podesta was referring to calls from some in Washington for Ukraine to release from prison the country's former prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, an opposition figure who opposes Russian influence and strives for Ukrainian integration into the European Union.At the time, John Podesta was reentering the White House as counselor. Reuters reported that Podesta ""said he had never discussed Ukraine with his brother and will not talk with him about policy matters after he reenters the Obama administration.""Reuters reported it was unclear who was funding the Centre at the time, with news reports tying it to Yanukovich's Party of Regions:The source of the lobbying funds from the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine is unclear. In a filing with the European Union, the group listed its budget for the financial year ending in November as 10,000 euros, or about $14,000 - a fraction of the $1.46 million it paid the Washington lobbyists.The Centre's managing director did not reply to two email inquiries. Sources and previous news reports described the group as tied to Yanukovich's Party of Regions.In March 2014, after Yanukovich was ousted as president, Bloomberg reported on Podesta's involvement with the European Centre, including a $510,000 payment to the Podesta Group that year:The European Centre involved Yanukovych's government and members of his political party ""because they were in the position to deliver on key reforms"" needed to integrate Ukraine with Europe, the organization said in a statement to Bloomberg News. ""Many of those reforms were initiated under the previous government. We hope that the current government will continue on this track. ...The Podesta Group is the third-biggest U.S. lobby firm by revenue, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The firm received $510,000 from the European group last year, Senate reports show, and Podesta said he still represents the organization.""We think it's in the interests of the Ukrainian people and Ukraine to join the EU,"" Podesta said in a telephone interview yesterday.""We're happy to do anything we can to promote Ukraine's aspirations to join the EU.""During the uprising that removed Yanukovych from power in February 2014, the Daily Beast reported anti-Yanukovych protesters also congregated outside Podesta's DC office to protest his firm's representation of the Centre.The Beast stated:Around 60 Ukrainian protesters from across the United States gathered on February 5th to protest outside the Podesta Group and Mercury/Clark & Weinstock, which are among the largest PR and lobbying firms in America. They sang the Ukrainian national anthem, chanted ""Slava Ukraini"" (Glory to Ukraine) and held up placards saying, ""Podesta Group Takes Blood Money,"" ""Return Blood Money,"" and ""Mercury, Stop Supporting the Bloody Regime In Ukraine.""The two PR firms have been the subject of an extensive investigation by Ukrainian journalist Sergiy Leschenko, who has accused them of acting on behalf of president Viktor Yanukovych and Ukraine's ruling Party of Regions to advance the government's interests on the Hill. Leschenko's reporting echoes a recent investigation by Reuters that found Yanukovych supporters had paid substantial amounts of money to the two firms.Meanwhile, after Yanukovych's downfall, Clinton reportedly described the deposed Ukrainian president as a weak leader, but one who at times appeared to value diplomacy. ""It surprised everyone when he chose to be closer to Russia,"" she added, at a March 2014 speech in Vancouver.Podesta is not the only high-profile figure with ties to the 2016 presidential candidates to have represented entities close to Yanukovych. Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, was an adviser to Yanukovych's presidential campaign. The Associated Press reported Manafort worked with a business associate to help the Centre secure Capital Hill lobbying firms, including the Podesta Group.Much of the media scrutiny following those revelations focused on Manafort while ignoring Podesta's more significant and longstanding ties to the Centre.Nature of activitiesWriting at the Sunlightfoundation.com in February 2014, Bill Allison spotlighted the Podesta Group's representation of the Centre as an example of lobbying disclosure requirements that do not apply to groups that are not official political organizations or direct representatives of foreign governments.Allison noted:The Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, requires lobbyists for foreign governments and political parties to disclose to the Justice Department detailed information about their activities on behalf of their clients. They have to disclose all contacts with U.S. government officials, any campaign contributions they've given, fees they receive from clients and expenses incurred in lobbying. They also have to disclose any ""informational materials"" (originally called propaganda) disseminated on behalf of their clients. Sunlight has digitized several years of filings under the act in the Foreign Lobbying Influence Tracker.The ECMU, however, is not a political party. It says its donors are private individuals not connected to the Regions Party; because of that, its lobbyists have the option of registering and disclosing their activities to Congress instead -- revealing far less information about their activities.The Foreign Agents Registration Act was signed into law by Bill Clinton on December 19, 1995.Uranium One, Russia, Podesta and the ClintonsThe Centre is not the only entity represented by Podesta's firm with questionable ties to Russia.Podesta Group also represented Uranium One, a uranium company acquired by the Russian government which received approval from Hillary Clinton's State Department to mine for uranium in the U.S. Podesta was first retained by Uranium One in 2012.The New York Times bestselling book Clinton Cash by Peter Schweizer documented that money was sent to the Clinton Foundation by persons with interest in the Uranium One deal. The New York Times itself reported Uranium One's chairman made four donations totaling $2.35 million utilizing his family charity. And Bill Clinton bagged $500,000 for one speech in Moscow from a Russian investment bank the Times described as having ""links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock.""An extensive Times piece documented that the Uranium One deal put Russian President Vladimir Putin closer to his longtime ""goal of controlling much of the global uranium supply chain.""Aaron Klein is Breitbart's Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

So Mr. Trump is going to go into Michigan today, and he's going to be talking a lot about two deals, in particular.""SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERTrump visited Novi, Michigan, Friday, where his emphasis is going to be on trade, according to Navarro.As for Hillary Clinton, ""She's a pathological liar like her husband,"" said Navarro. Referencing the recent debate, he said:The biggest lie she told that night was she denied having called the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal the gold standard of trade agreements, and there was a flood of fact-checking that went on the next day that showed her doing exactly that [lying] repeatedly.""One is the 2012 South Korean deal,"" stated Navarro. He added:It's really a poster child for Hillary Clinton's incompetence. She was secretary of state in 2012. She crisscrossed this country and Asia telling everybody that this was going to be a cutting-edge deal, promised us 70,000 jobs, and here's what happened: We lost 100,000 jobs because of that South Korean deal. Our trade deficit has doubled, and, more importantly, 75 percent of the damage that has been caused by that deal has been to the auto industry itself, which, of course, is based in Michigan.Navarro asserted, ""Donald Trump's trade doctrine is simple. Any deal that's going to be negotiated has to increase our growth, decrease our trade deficit, and strengthen our manufacturing base. The South Korea deal is a perfect example of violating every single one of those rules.""Concerning Hillary Clinton, ""It's not just the bad trade deals. It's the con game, and she lies,"" said Navarro, pointing out that she and husband Bill ran against NAFTA in 1992; then he signed off on it as president.Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. EST.LISTEN:The biggest lie she told that night was she denied having called the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal the gold standard of trade agreements, and there was a flood of fact-checking that went on the next day that showed her doing exactly that [lying] repeatedly.It's really a poster child for Hillary Clinton's incompetence.

That is exactly why I am voting for him,"" she said. ""I'm a lifelong Democrat. I've always voted Democrat. I voted for our President two times, Mr. Barack Obama."" She added, ""You know, I believed in him when he said, 'Yes, we can,' and 'You know there's hope. We can do it together,' and here it is eight years later; nothing happened.""LISTEN:Donald-Kyei described her disillusionment with Obama's failure to live up to his promises, saying she was a Bernie Sanders supporter who decisively broke with the Democrats for the way he was treated in the 2016 primary:In the inner cities, we've got killing going on. We've got hopelessness. We've got people who waited on life support for the President and for others in the party, the Democratic Party, to come through with jobs, and education, and improved communities, and investment in the community, education - waited for something to happen.And once again, you know, the broken promises. Nothing happened. And so this time, I really started to - you know, I voted for Bernie Sanders. I didn't even vote for Hillary Clinton in the primaries. I was a Bernie Sanders girl. Once Bernie Sanders, I saw how we were treated at the Democratic National Convention, and I knew that I would not vote for Hillary Clinton, and the Trump Train just kept calling my name. He just kept saying the right things: ""I want to bring jobs, I want to bring education, school choice, to the black community, and to our communities, to poor communities, so that every child can enjoy the American Dream, whether your mother makes two dollars an hour, or whether your mother or father makes two billion dollars an hour. I want every child to have the best education. We need to build that wall because we're not safe. Different people are coming into the country, and we don't know who they are. We're not vetting them.""And so I kept hearing that, and you know, people were saying it's about the Mexicans. It's about Mexico. Mexican people aren't the only ones coming through Mexico. There are other illegal immigrants coming in through Mexico.The NAFTA deals, when he started talking about how we're not getting the right end of the stick on the trade deals. Our country has basically - our country has been starved in order to take care of overseas.Put it like this, Mr. Boyle, this is how it really kinda came home for me: Imagine you have a man who gets a paycheck, and he has a wife and kids at home. So he comes home with his paycheck, and his wife says, ""Hey, where's your money at? You know, we've got to get milk, we gotta pay rent, we've got to pay this, we've got to pay that."" And the man says, ""You know what, baby? Mr. Johnson's family was really, really, really suffering, so you know what, I gave them my paycheck. And I've been giving them my paycheck every month."" Anybody would say that's hypocritical. How are you gonna starve your own family, and go and feed Mr. Johnson's family, and make them feel better and be better? That's exactly what's been happening under this Democratic rule. They've been feeding other countries, sending billions and billions to other countries, and we have people in the inner cities in our poor white communities, poor Hispanic, poor black, poor Arab communities, Asian communities, that need that money. We have homeless veterans that need those millions and billions.And so, once I started breaking it down on the issues, and stopped really thinking about it emotionally, I realized that as an American, if I didn't take off my Democratic or my Republican hat, that I would be voting for the downfall of the country. And so I got on the Trump Train immediately, and began supporting Donald Trump.Donald-Kyei said there are many other disillusioned Democrats who might be ready to climb aboard the Trump Train:Let me tell you what's going on: we all voted for change, for hope, from President Obama, and basically what happened is, I know with black people - I'm not trying to be funny - there were black people that we all voted together, and they were like, ""Oh, we know he's not gonna do anything. He's a puppet. He's not going to do anything. I don't believe him.""And this was black people across the table, saying it in their homes, in quiet, not really in the public. I was one of those people that actually believed hope and change was gonna come, and so that first four years, like many black people, especially the ones in poverty, we thought, okay, well, he did have a lot of wealthy donors that put him in office and stuff, too. So maybe once he takes care of Wall Street, and bails out these companies, and takes care of the people that put him in there with the millions, then his next four years - which will be 2012 to 2016 - he'll take care of the black community. He'll take care of the poor Hispanics, poor whites. He'll take care of women. He'll take care of the rest of us.And then it slowly began to dawn on me - and it dawned on a lot of poor people, whether you be black, white, Hispanic, Arab, Asian - it dawned on them that hope, that change that was being promised was not coming. People became disappointed, they became hurt, they became hopeless, they became distraught because, like me, they did believe in what the President had told us.Now, you're gonna get a lot of black people that will say, because they want to vote emotionally and not really look at the facts on the ground with poor people, they'll say, ""Well, you know, the Republican Congress, they blocked him. That's why he couldn't do anything for black people."" And that's rubbish.Donald-Kyei pointed out that when it was time for his $1.7 billion payoff to Iran, President Obama did not worry much about what Republicans (or many Democrats) in Congress thought, and did not think about putting that money into desperate communities in America instead.""What about that $5 billion that went into the Obamacare website?"" she asked, adding:He could have said, you know what, why don't I take a five hundred dollar website, and take this other four-billion-and-something, and send it into the inner cities of Maryland, or Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, anywhere. Just send the money to Americans. What about our veterans, who are committing suicide, 22 of them a day. Let me put it into the military, make them stronger. Like I said, it dawned on people that every other country built infrastructure, and lives were getting better, while Americans were being starved.She had some choice words for media outlets that are biased towards the Democrats, like CNN and MSNBC:Imagine if, during slavery, and during the civil rights movement, and during the times when our country, the Framers, were coming about, thinking they were going to make our country free. Imagine if the journalists only told one side of the story. We would still be slaves. Black people would still be slaves, if journalists, if people were not neutral, and didn't just tell the news the way it was.And so that's when you know our country is in trouble. When you have journalists, who are supposed to be neutral, who are supposed to be sort of the voice of the people, who are the voice of the elitists, of the establishment, of the people who want to continue to control the 99 percent of us - that scared me to death, when I realized that our media is actually picking a side. That's not your job! Your job is to report the news, report what each candidate is doing, not skew everything, turn everything around on one candidate because one of your donors is the seventh-biggest donor to Hillary Clinton. It's just too much, Mr. Boyle.Donald-Kyei agreed with Boyle that Trump was offering a number of specific, game-changing proposals, like school choice, while his opponent runs on ""Hate Trump! Hate Trump! Hate Trump! Vote for me! I'm a woman.""Of Trump's message, she said:But you know, the thing about it is, Donald Trump is saying, ""Hey, we're going to bring jobs. Inner city youth that's dying out here - hello, how about we offer them jobs? How about we offer them some vocational programs or some apprenticeships? How about I put some money into those communities so that we can leave no child behind, that every child - whether you're black, or white, or Hispanic, or Asian - that you deserve the American dream?""In addition to educational reforms, she mentioned child care, where ""people are choosing between their rent or their gas money, whether they're going to buy their babies milk or pay their cable bill.""Donald-Kyei argued these real-world concerns were more important than what the media tend to focus on because people cannot pay their electricity bills with a stack of scandal headlines.""In Donald Trump, we have a presidential candidate who is thinking about the little guy on the bottom, who's making no money, who's unemployed,"" she argued, while rejecting the notion that life is improved for that little guy merely by punishing the rich. ""They're putting money into our country. You shouldn't be punished because you're living the American Dream,"" she said. ""We all want to live the American Dream. That's why Donald Trump is so important. He's saying, 'Look, I don't care about your race. I don't care about your color. I care that you really have a real shot at the American Dream.'"" ""His policies that he's coming out with, he's laying them out for a common-sense person to understand. He's not trying to talk over any American's head."" She declared, ""He's talking directly to America, and that's why he is, I believe, the candidate that should go into office and that we should have the inauguration for on January 20th, 2017.""Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.Listen to the full audio of Brunell Donald-Kyei's interview above.In the inner cities, we've got killing going on.

He's a puppet. He's not going to do anything. I don't believe him.""And this was black people across the table, saying it in their homes, in quiet, not really in the public. I was one of those people that actually believed hope and change was gonna come, and so that first four years, like many black people, especially the ones in poverty, we thought, okay, well, he did have a lot of wealthy donors that put him in office and stuff, too. So maybe once he takes care of Wall Street, and bails out these companies, and takes care of the people that put him in there with the millions, then his next four years - which will be 2012 to 2016 - he'll take care of the black community. He'll take care of the poor Hispanics, poor whites. He'll take care of women. He'll take care of the rest of us.And then it slowly began to dawn on me - and it dawned on a lot of poor people, whether you be black, white, Hispanic, Arab, Asian - it dawned on them that hope, that change that was being promised was not coming. People became disappointed, they became hurt, they became hopeless, they became distraught because, like me, they did believe in what the President had told us.Now, you're gonna get a lot of black people that will say, because they want to vote emotionally and not really look at the facts on the ground with poor people, they'll say, ""Well, you know, the Republican Congress, they blocked him. That's why he couldn't do anything for black people."" And that's rubbish.Donald-Kyei pointed out that when it was time for his $1.7 billion payoff to Iran, President Obama did not worry much about what Republicans (or many Democrats) in Congress thought, and did not think about putting that money into desperate communities in America instead.""What about that $5 billion that went into the Obamacare website?"" she asked, adding:He could have said, you know what, why don't I take a five hundred dollar website, and take this other four-billion-and-something, and send it into the inner cities of Maryland, or Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, anywhere. Just send the money to Americans. What about our veterans, who are committing suicide, 22 of them a day. Let me put it into the military, make them stronger. Like I said, it dawned on people that every other country built infrastructure, and lives were getting better, while Americans were being starved.She had some choice words for media outlets that are biased towards the Democrats, like CNN and MSNBC:Imagine if, during slavery, and during the civil rights movement, and during the times when our country, the Framers, were coming about, thinking they were going to make our country free. Imagine if the journalists only told one side of the story. We would still be slaves. Black people would still be slaves, if journalists, if people were not neutral, and didn't just tell the news the way it was.And so that's when you know our country is in trouble. When you have journalists, who are supposed to be neutral, who are supposed to be sort of the voice of the people, who are the voice of the elitists, of the establishment, of the people who want to continue to control the 99 percent of us - that scared me to death, when I realized that our media is actually picking a side. That's not your job! Your job is to report the news, report what each candidate is doing, not skew everything, turn everything around on one candidate because one of your donors is the seventh-biggest donor to Hillary Clinton. It's just too much, Mr. Boyle.Donald-Kyei agreed with Boyle that Trump was offering a number of specific, game-changing proposals, like school choice, while his opponent runs on ""Hate Trump! Hate Trump! Hate Trump! Vote for me! I'm a woman.""Of Trump's message, she said:But you know, the thing about it is, Donald Trump is saying, ""Hey, we're going to bring jobs. Inner city youth that's dying out here - hello, how about we offer them jobs? How about we offer them some vocational programs or some apprenticeships? How about I put some money into those communities so that we can leave no child behind, that every child - whether you're black, or white, or Hispanic, or Asian - that you deserve the American dream?""In addition to educational reforms, she mentioned child care, where ""people are choosing between their rent or their gas money, whether they're going to buy their babies milk or pay their cable bill.""Donald-Kyei argued these real-world concerns were more important than what the media tend to focus on because people cannot pay their electricity bills with a stack of scandal headlines.""In Donald Trump, we have a presidential candidate who is thinking about the little guy on the bottom, who's making no money, who's unemployed,"" she argued, while rejecting the notion that life is improved for that little guy merely by punishing the rich. ""They're putting money into our country. You shouldn't be punished because you're living the American Dream,"" she said. ""We all want to live the American Dream. That's why Donald Trump is so important. He's saying, 'Look, I don't care about your race. I don't care about your color. I care that you really have a real shot at the American Dream.'"" ""His policies that he's coming out with, he's laying them out for a common-sense person to understand. He's not trying to talk over any American's head."" She declared, ""He's talking directly to America, and that's why he is, I believe, the candidate that should go into office and that we should have the inauguration for on January 20th, 2017."""

Blige on her Apple TV show The 411. ""Do you think it's hard for a woman to be both tough and likeable?"" she asked.Clinton says women have struggled for tens of thousands of years with different societies and cultures defining how a woman should act, pointing out that it was still a struggle for women to lead in business, entertainment and politics.""It's still is not fully understood because there's no blueprint for doing it,"" she said. ""Everybody comes to it differently, so people are always judging how we look and how we talk and all the rest of it.""Clinton said she was running for president because she wanted to break the ""highest and hardest glass ceiling"" so that both boys and girls could realize they could succeed in whatever they wanted to do.""I hope, though, that by running this campaign and by I hope winning this campaign, it's really going to change a lot of people's minds, and it will open doors for a lot of other people too,"" she said.She also fired back at her critics, who she accused of manufacturing details about who she really was.""I really am against people who try to maintain division and point fingers and scapegoat others,"" she said.Clinton says it's difficult to live in the public eye, but relied on her faith, her family, her friends, and the ""circle of people who I can trust 100 percent.""She explained that it was important to take criticism seriously, but not personally.""Don't take it personally, don't let people own your heart, own your mind, really under the pressure you feel, turn yourself into someone that you're not,"" she said.Blige flattered Clinton, telling her that she looked ""phenomenal"" while she was wearing white and had perfect hair, makeup, and earrings.At the end of the interview, Blige sang Hillary a song about African-American parents sending their kids to school, knowing they could face discrimination or death from police officers.Clinton appeared taken aback, but promised to do everything possible as president to raise the issue.""There needs to be a greater opening of our hearts to one another, we have to put ourselves in each other's shoes, feel the pain that a mother and a father feel when their son and daughter can go out the door and don't know what's going to happen to them,"" she said. ""I particularly want white people to understand what's that like, and to feel like they must be part of the solution.""She encouraged Blige to sing in every interview.""That was so touching to me ... it was so moving to me ... it's so emotionally powerful, Mary,"" Clinton said.SIGN UP"	['Clinton']	[]

""But I don't think it's going to happen.""Dirks spoke at a panel discussion on the topic of ""Who Pays For World-Class Universities?"" during the Times Higher Education (THE) World Academic Summit.""[I]f such a thing came to be, there would be a real concerted effort to control parts of some of the great research institutions that are public in ways that might compromise their capacity to compete at the highest level,"" he added, noting as well that implementing Clinton's plan would be a ""complicated political process"" since state governments oversee universities.Chelsea Clinton, however, told attendees at East Carolina University in North Carolina Wednesday, ""My mom has a plan to help millions of Americans with their debt right now and a plan to make college debt-free for future generations.""As Reflector.com reports, Chelsea Clinton said her mother's plan - referred to as a New College Compact - calls for families with incomes of $125,000 or less to pay no tuition at in-state public colleges and universities. Additionally, the Democrat presidential nominee would cap a person's income that would go toward student loan debt at 10 percent and forgive loans after payments have been made for 20 years.However, just as with No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top - the latter of which gave us Common Core - Clinton's ""Compact"" revolves around the federal government incentivizing states with federal money and perks in return for debt-free tuition for lower income students. Chelsea Clinton said her mother's plan ""will invest $4 of federal money to every $1 invested by states in education. However, this plan calls for states to stop making cuts in their education.""Nevertheless, writing at Forbes, George Leef also asserts what Dirks observed: that Hillary Clinton can't ""fix"" college with more federal interference and control. Leef notes that Clinton's objective of launching more low-income students into college contains ""two mistaken beliefs"": ""that the cost of attending is the main reason why many students from non-wealthy families don't graduate from college and that getting a college degree would be very beneficial to them.""Leef first observes that, although the cost of college has indeed risen, other low-cost options are available, such as community college - the expense for which can often be covered by Pell grants.""As for four-year institutions, there are many public schools where tuition remains quite affordable,"" he continues. ""The higher education market is like the restaurant market -- there are options for all budgets. When people shop around for higher education, almost no one is completely priced out.""Leef further urges low-income students to explore private scholarships such as the United Negro College Fund and the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation.""The great thing about private scholarships is that they can't be turned into entitlements,"" he notes. ""Students have to strive to be thought worthy of support.""Leef points out, however, that cost is not the primary reason lower income students don't seek out college.""The main reason why most don't enroll isn't the cost, but rather because they aren't academically prepared for or (even if academically prepared) interested in devoting more years of their lives to formal schooling,"" he says. ""Trying to lure such individuals into college with free tuition is a bad idea.""Observing the current glut of college degree holders with no jobs, Leef asserts the free market reality.""The economy does not automatically create more 'good jobs' simply because more college graduates enter the labor market,"" he explains. ""Government policy aimed at 'producing' more graduates will only mean more young people who are over-credentialed for the work available.""""America doesn't have a shortage of people with college degrees,"" Leef concludes. ""What it does have is a shortage of jobs that pay well. Unfortunately, the Clinton plan would make that problem even worse.""SIGN UP"	['Clinton']	[]

18	18	http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/09/30/fact-check-five-things-to-know-alicia-machado/	Fact Check: Five Things to Know About Alicia Machado	"In the late 1990s, as President Bill Clinton was about to face the biggest sex scandal of his political career over his affair with Monica Lewinsky, a beauty queen named Alicia Machado caused a major scandal by gaining a large amount of weight after winning the Miss Universe crown.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERDonald Trump had just taken over the pageant, and fought to deal with the fallout.Hillary Clinton has, for months, planned to use that episode against him, training Machado for the attack. Here are the facts.1. Trump fought to save Machado's Miss Universe title, and her job. What is a sensitive feminist male boss supposed to do if a female employee -- hired, again, for her appearance -- gains a large amount of weight? He is supposed to defend her job. And that is exactly what Trump did, urging the pageant not to fire her, and appearing with her at a gym to offer support. In an excerpt from his book The Art of the Comeback, Rush Limbaugh noted Thursday, Trump recalled the episode:""First, she wins. Second, she gains fifty pounds. Third, I urged the committee not to fire her. Fourth, I go to the gym with her in a show of support. Final act: She trashes me in the Washington Post -- after I stood by her the entire time. What's wrong with this picture? Anyway, the best part about the evening was the knowledge that next year she would no longer be Miss Universe. What's maddening is that I supported her.""Even in Palm Beach, where I haven't always gotten the greatest press, Shannon Donnelly, society columnist for the Palm Beach Daily News,"" known here as the Shiny Sheet, ""wrote, 'Here's a new one for the Donald: Protector-Advocate for large women. His acquisition from ITT has put Alicia Machado under the Trump Aegis. The Donald, bless his heart, doesn't want to fire her because ""it would be a terrible message to send."" He is instead bringing her to the spa at Mar-a-Lago where she can work out in earnest, eat sensibly and generally decompress.' That sounds pretty gentlike to me.""2. A Venezuelan judge accused Machado of threatening to kill him. From a 1998 news report: ""Machado, who grabbed world headlines for nearly losing her crown after a sudden weight gain, burst back into the limelight last month when lawyers named her as the getaway driver for her boyfriend in a shooting last November ... [Judge Maximiliano] Fuenmayor, who reported the alleged threats to police, said he traced the caller through an incoming call identity function on his mobile telephone."" The New York Post repored at the time that Machado ""was seen driving the car in which her boyfriend, Juan Rodriguez Reggeti, sped away after shooting his brother-in-law in the head in Caracas on Nov. 21,"" citing the victim's family's lawyer. (He survived.) Machado denied the charges, which were later dropped for lack of sufficient evidence.3. Machado damaged her own reputation by having sex live on television. In 2005, Machado appeared on The Farm, a Spanish-language version of the Big Brother program. She had sex with the host of the show, even though she was engaged to Major League Baseball player Bobby Abreu of the Philadelphia Phillies at the time. Abreu called off the wedding after the humiliating episode aired on TV. Machado wrote of her new lover, according to the Sun: ""He treats me like a goddess, he f***s me like a b****!"" In 2006, she became the first Miss Universe to pose nude for Playboy, appearing in Playboy Mexico.4. The Clinton campaign has been coaching Machado for months to attack Trump. From the Washington Post:Operatives in Brooklyn had been working with Machado since the summer. They had a video featuring her story ready to go. Cosmopolitan had a photo spread of her draped in an American flag - to go with a profile - in the can. Machado had also conducted an interview with The Guardian that was ""apparently embargoed for post-debate release,"" according to Vox. And the Clinton super PAC Priorities USA turned a digital ad to highlight the insults by early afternoon.5. Machado did, in fact, gain weight during her reign as Miss Universe. The Economist reported that she put on ""15 kilos within weeks of winning her title."" Other newspapers called her ""The Incredible Bulk."" What was at issue was not her weight or appearance, but that she had just won a competition in which she voluntarily submitted herself to be judged for both -- against hundreds of other contestants who would have taken her place. The Orlando Sentinel wrote: ""No one, of course, raised an eyebrow when Machado basically starved herself before the competition. But when she gained anywhere from a reported 22 to 50 pounds afterward, she caused quite the international stir."" Trump denies calling her ""Miss Piggy"" or ""Miss Housekeeping,"" as Machado now claims (though he is on record at the time having called her an ""eating machine""). Machado told the Miami Herald that before the beauty pageant, ""I was anorexic and bulimic, but almost all of us are.""Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News. His new book, See No Evil: 19 Hard Truths the Left Can't Handle, is available from Regnery through Amazon. Follow him on Twitter at @joelpollak.""First, she wins. Second, she gains fifty pounds.

Michael Phelps alone among the men who won gold at Rio heard his name called by the commander in chief. At one point, he read off descriptions of the feats of 12 Olympians -- all of them women. In this list, he mentioned the sports that these 12 women competed in save for Kim Rhode, whom he calls a ""female Olympian"" who ""medaled at six straight Games."" Medaled in what? Shooting.""You will notice that there was a preponderance of women that I was mentioning here,"" he explained regarding a list entirely comprised of women. ""One of the reasons our country is so proud of this year's Team USA is 2016 belonged to America's women Olympians, I mean, no question. We had more women competing in these Games than any nation ever. Our women alone won more golds than most countries did.

America's team in Rio consisted of 291 women and 263 men.""And then there are some firsts that show the world America's greatness doesn't come only from high scores or fast times, but from our diversity and our tolerance and our open hearts,"" the president announced of a bronze medalist at this year's games. ""This summer's fencer, Ibtihaj Muhammad, became the first American female athlete to compete in the Olympic Games in a hijab. And that's important too, because one of the wonderful things we love when we see our Olympians is everybody is from all kinds of different backgrounds and shapes and sizes -- although all very good-looking.""President Obama maintained that the essential ingredients to sending such a successful delegation of athletes to Rio included gay rights and open borders. He explained:There's no kid in America who can't look at our Olympic team and see themselves somewhere. That's part of the reason why we're successful -- because we gather talent from every corner of the globe. And through the years of people arriving -- whether it's in Ellis Island or Angel Island or coming over the Rio Grande; some cases, coming not of their own accord -- we've become something more than just the sum of our parts. We've become Americans together. And there's something special about that -- all races, all faiths, all traditions, all orientations, all marching together under that same proud flag. Not bound by a creed or a color, but by our devotion to an enduring set of ideals: That we're all created equal, that we can think and worship and love as we please, and that we can pursue our own version of happiness.The president also recognized two past Olympians, runners John Carlos and Tommie Smith, who gained fame for raising black-gloved fists during the national anthem at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City. Obama characterized the two track stars as symbols of unity. The president, who invited the pair to the event, held: ""Their powerful silent protest in the 1968 Games was controversial, but it woke folks up and created greater opportunity for those that followed.""In one part of the event devoid of politicization, gymnast Simone Biles presented the president with a surf board signed by the Olympians attending the White House event. The Hawaii-born Obama noted that next year offers him much time to surf.There's no kid in America who can't look at our Olympic team and see themselves somewhere.

Abbas opted to attend Peres's funeral, making the short drive from nearby Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank, through Israeli military checkpoints.""Long time, long time,"" Abbas told Netanyahu and the prime minister's wife Sara, after shaking his hand before the start of the ceremony held in the ""Great Leaders of the Nation"" section of Mount Herzl cemetery, overlooking a forested valley.Welcoming Abbas, as participants recorded the encounter on their mobile phones, Netanyahu said of the Palestinian leader's attendance: ""It's something that I appreciate very much on behalf of our people and on behalf of us.""In Israel for just a few hours to pay tribute to Peres, Obama said in the eulogy that Abbas's ""presence here is a gesture and a reminder of the unfinished business of peace"". He was the only speaker to acknowledge Abbas's presence.In Gaza, ruled by the Islamist group Hamas, hundreds of Palestinians rallied after Friday prayers condemning the participation of Palestinian and Arab leaders in the funeral.FRONT ROWAbbas was given a front-row seat between European Council President Donald Tusk and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Obama briefly greeted the Palestinian leader with a kiss on each cheek before walking down the line to stand next to Netanyahu.""Even in the face of terrorist attacks, even after repeated disappointments at the negotiation table, (Peres) insisted that as human beings, Palestinians must be seen as equal in dignity to Jews and must therefore be equal in self-determination,"" Obama said in his address.U.S. officials have held open the possibility of Obama making another formal effort to get peace negotiations back on the agenda before he leaves office in January, possibly via a U.N. Security Council resolution.Netanyahu recalled in his eulogy that he had once argued with Peres, a former leader of the center-left Labour Party, about what was more important for Israel - peace or security.""Shimon, you said, 'Bibi: the best security is peace.' And I said, 'without security there can be no peace.'""""And you know what our surprise conclusion was? We are both right... The goal is not power. Power is the vehicle. The goal is existence and co-existence,"" Netanyahu said.Peres, who suffered a stroke two weeks ago, was buried in a Jewish religious ceremony in a plot between two other former prime ministers, Yitzhak Rabin and Yitzhak Shamir. Rabin was assassinated by an ultranationalist Israeli in 1995 over the interim peace deals struck with the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.""Gone too soon,"" one of Peres's two sons, Yoni, quoted his father as telling him when asked what he wanted as his epitaph.Amos Oz, the celebrated Israeli author and peace campaigner who was a long-time friend of Peres, said in his eulogy it was time to create a Palestinian state alongside Israel. ""We must split this house into two apartments,"" Oz said. ""Where are the brave and wise leaders who will continue his legacy?""SIGN UP"	['Israel', 'Obama']	[]

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and a Syrian military source said government forces had captured territory north of the city and buildings in the city centre.Rebel sources however denied any additional advances north of the city by government forces that seized the Handarat camp area north of Aleppo on Thursday. A rebel official said government forces had advanced in the Suleiman al-Halabi district of central Aleppo, but were then forced to withdraw.The Syrian military and its allies launched a Russian-backed offensive one week ago aimed at capturing rebel-held districts of eastern Aleppo that are home to more than 250,000 people.Aleppo has been divided into government and opposition sectors for four years.A water station was bombed in the Suleiman al-Halabi district, dealing a further blow to a water system already badly damaged during the offensive. The Observatory blamed government forces. A Syrian military source, however, said rebels had blown it up.The Observatory, a Britain-based war monitor, reported heavy bombardment by government forces and violent ""back and forth"" fighting in the Suleiman al-Halabi neighbourhood.The Syrian military source said government forces captured several buildings in the area and were ""continuing to chase the remnants of the terrorists fleeing them"".The rebel official however said government forces had ""advanced and then retreated"", losing ""a number of dead"".In the fighting north of Aleppo, the Observatory and a television station operated by Hezbollah said government forces had taken the Kindi Hospital area adjacent to the Handarat Palestinian refugee camp, a few kilometres (miles) from the city. Hezbollah is a Lebanese group fighting alongside the army.But rebel sources denied that the government had captured the Kindi Hospital area, saying fighting was still going on.A senior rebel official also said that government forces were shelling the rebel-held districts with artillery from a hilltop to the east of the city.SIGN UP"	[]	[]

The latest average, as of Sep. 24 -- prior to the first presidential debate on Sep. 26 -- has Trump ahead of Clinton by 2%.Earlier in September, the Times was declaring Ohio ""an essential swing state,"" where Governor John Kasich threatened to destroy Trump's presidential hopes by withholding his endorsement and denying Trump his turnout operation. The Times added: ""No candidate since 1960 has made it to the White House without winning Ohio. And while Mrs. Clinton could afford to lose there given her advantage in other battlegrounds like Virginia and Colorado, Ohio is a must-win for Mr. Trump.""Now that Trump is winning the ""must-win,"" the Times has revised its view of Ohio's importance: ""After decades as one of America's most reliable political bellwethers, an inevitable presidential battleground that closely mirrored the mood and makeup of the country, Ohio is suddenly fading in importance this year,"" writes Jonathan Martin, who notes that Clinton has basically conceded the state.""Mr. Trump's unyielding anti-trade campaign and Mrs. Clinton's difficulty energizing Ohio's young voters have made it a lesser focus for Democrats this year, even as it remains critical to Mr. Trump's path to the White House,"" he explains (emphasis added).That bit of revisionist history is necessary to avoid drawing the alternative conclusion, which is that Trump's success in the bellwether state of Ohio could portend success elsewhere as well.Joel B.

We shouldn't live in a society so awash with guns that [it] makes the cops fearful and makes them suspicious of everybody.""The Breakfast Club host DJ Envy said, ""You travel a lot. You've been to Toronto, you've been to Japan, and you notice when you go to a lot of these countries, people are not allowed to have guns."" Legend interjected, ""Yes, and their murder rates are way lower. Their suicide rates are lower, too, because when people have guns, they end up using them.""Envy asked, ""So banning guns in full, you're saying?""Legend responded:I'm not saying that necessarily would work. But if we look at Australia, they did something over there. They had a few mass shootings, and they said, ""You know what? We're going to take a pretty significant approach to reducing the amount of guns on the streets."" And it worked. They didn't have another mass shooting, their murder rate went down, and we won't do it here because we got the Second Amendment. We got the NRA that's going to lobby against it. And maybe it won't be constitutional to do that, but at the end of the day, it actually worked. And if we want to talk about what makes us safer, that would make us safer.First, Australia's gun confiscation scheme was fashioned as a gun buyback-a mandatory buyback-where people with guns the government wished to ban were required to turn in those guns. The scheme resulted in the confiscation of somewhere between 650,000 and 1,000,000 firearms during the years 1996-1997. (Figures vary.) On September 13, 2016, Breitbart News reported that Australia is considering a new body of gun laws to fight the rising gun crime that is marring Melbourne, Australia, and much of Victoria. In fact, Melbourne has had more than one shooting a week since January 2015.But the Australian model is Legend's solution?Second, part of what Australia is now considering to fight gun crime is an ""amnesty"" whereby criminals will have a period of time to turn their guns in without penalty. Ironically, during Legend's appearance on The Breakfast Club, he was told a lot of people do not turn in their guns during buybacks because they are afraid that the gun-and the crimes committed with it-will somehow be traced back to them. Legend responded by suggesting some type of ""amnesty"" period to get guns off the street.So he is pushing the Australian gun buyback that did not prevent criminals from having guns in the first place and is also pushing the second phase of that failed policy: ""amnesty"" for criminals with guns.Legend also blamed Chicago's gun crime on Indiana, claiming that criminals in Chicago go to Indiana to buy their guns. This opened the door for him to criticize the differences in gun laws from state to state in the U.S. He said, ""We'd have to do something nationally that was much more pervasive to get rid of guns.""AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

Police had arrived on the scene after being called by Olango's sister, who said that he had been acting strangely. A widely-circulated image of the confrontation, which looks like an armed standoff, suggests that one police officer was black and the other was white. One officer reportedly fired a Taser but the other fired live ammunition.On Thursday evening, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports, ""about 50 to 75 people -- a smaller crowd than previous nights -- took over the intersection of Broadway and Mollison Avenue"" and ""stopped passing vehicles and broke several of their windows"" at about 8 p.m., according to police. There was also a confrontation with a motorcyclist who lost control of his vehicle, and police made two arrests, firing pepper balls to disperse the crowd after people began throwing glass bottles.The Los Angeles Times reports that Olango was supposed to have been deported from the United States twice, after separate federal convictions, first on drug charges in 2002 and second on weapons charges in 2009. He could not be deported because the Ugandan government failed to provide travel documents, and he was released under supervision by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

I have and it's absolutely bloody terrifying. The claustrophobia; the rising heat; the shortage of air; the gnawing fear that something even worse might happen - a fire, say - before the rescue services have time to reach you...SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERWell, in the South Australian blackouts this week a lot of people had exactly this nightmare experience. Others found themselves on trains that suddenly stopped, or stuck on aeroplanes unable to disembark, or gridlocked in traffic, or stuck in their homes without TV or refrigeration or air-conditioning  or hot food or heating or internet or any way of discovering what was happening in the outside world.In Third World countries and war zones, people get used to this kind of thing. But the idea that such a state of affairs should apply in country like Australia is absurd beyond measure. Not as absurd or outrageous, though, as the disgraceful fact that this was a largely man-made disaster brought about by government green energy policy.This graph from Stop These Things tells the story better than words can:Yep. Jo Nova quite rightly says that we should remain cautious until the full facts emerge. But does look quite likely that power surges from those wonderful wind turbines championed by green activists and shyster politicians alike from Ontario to the US to Germany to the UK may have crashed the entire grid network of a whole Australian state, populated by 1.7 million people.As Stop These Things  puts it:The price of living with 'PEC' - ie trying to run on sunshine and breezes - is paid for with wrecked electrical appliances and - when the system shuts down to protect itself from wind power surges and collapses - the failure of whole local systems.PEC by the way - it stands for Power Electric Converter - is the fancy local euphemism for wind and solar energy.Clearly, lots of South Australians were very impressed by the sound of it when they voted in their current Labor government, led by one Jay Weatherill and including Energy Minister Tom Koutsantonis who has successfully made their state the most eco-friendly in all Australia. Wind power comprises an astonishing 40 per cent of South Australia's energy capacity.Perhaps they're less impressed now they've seen what ""clean energy"" does. (When it's not slicing and dicing avian fauna; and blighting the landscape; making people sick with headaches, palpitations, insomnia, heart problems, anxiety attacks, raised cortisol levels; driving up electricity prices to eye-watering levels; and sucking up subsidies for a few lucky landowners and green troughers while everyone else has the extra cost dumped on their electricity bills).Australia's conservative Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has seized the opportunity to criticise left-wing local governments like South Australia's for their aggressive renewable energy policies:""A number of the state Labor Governments have over the years set priorities and renewable targets that are extremely aggressive, extremely unrealistic, and have paid little or no attention to energy security.""This would be much more convincing if the Honourable Member for Goldman Sachs wasn't himself part of the problem. Though Turnbull currently leads Australia's conservative party - the Liberals - he is the embodiment of the smoothy-chops, Davos-Man, globalist elite which bears much of the responsibility for pushing the green agenda.Around the world, some politicians are waking up to the fact that global warming is a much, much smaller problem than the expensive, counterproductive measures being taken to deal with it.Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy recently came out as a global warming sceptic -The climate has been changing for four billion years,"" said the Republican leader, ""but it wasn't industry that turned the Sahara into a desert.""as, of course US presidential contender Donald Trump.But there is currently not a single major economy anywhere in the Western world which doesn't pay lip service to the supposed renewable energy imperative that has just wreaked such havoc in South Australia.Something needs to be done about this. The South Australian experience really ought to be a wake-up call to the rest of the world.The price of living with 'PEC' - ie trying to run on sunshine and breezes - is paid for with wrecked electrical appliances and - when the system shuts down to protect itself from wind power surges and collapses - the failure of whole local systems.""A number of the state Labor Governments have over the years set priorities and renewable targets that are extremely aggressive, extremely unrealistic, and have paid little or no attention to energy security.""The climate has been changing for four billion years,"" said the Republican leader, ""but it wasn't industry that turned the Sahara into a desert.""SIGN UP"	['Trump']	[]

They joined thousands of Israelis and Peres family members to pay their last respects to the Nobel Peace Prize winner who died aged 93 on Wednesday.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERA tireless campaigner for Middle East peace who remained energetic until the final days of his seven decades in public life, the Polish-born soldier-turned-statesman was  praised for his tireless engagement.President Reuven Rivlin, among the first to speak at the service, said: ""You were not only a man of vision, you were a man of deeds. You had the ability to conceive what seemed to be the inconceivable, and see it to fruition""You strived until your final breaths to reach the pinnacle of the Zionist dream: an independent, sovereign state, existing in peace with our neighbours. Yet you also knew that true peace could only be achieved from a position of strength, and you were sure to secure the path to this goal.""Mr. Peres moved with his family in the 1930s to then British-ruled Palestine and was part of almost every major political development in Israel from its founding in 1948. He served in a dozen cabinets and was twice prime minister, though he never won a general election.Mr. Peres was first elected to parliament in 1959 and, barring a brief interlude in early 2006, held his seat for 48 years, before becoming president in 2007.The extraordinary turnout for his funeral was evidence of his wider impact on global affairs although the rulers of Egypt and Jordan, the only Arab states to have signed peace treaties with Israel, in 1979 and 1994, were absent. But the Egyptian foreign minister came and King Abdullah of Jordan sent a telegram of condolences.Britain's Prince Charles, French President Francois Hollande, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, Polish President Andrzej Duda, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and former British leaders David Cameron and Tony Blair also were at the funeral.A selection of pictures appears below that captures the day's solemn events.Prince Charles, Prince of Wales wearing a 'Yarmulke,' or Jewish skull cap during the funeral of Shimon Peres at Mount Herzl Cemetery  in Jerusalem, Israel.
