Bringing FARC Children Safely Home	Hide and seek is meant to be a child's game. Counting to ten should only take a few seconds and finding a child hiding under a table usually takes just a couple of minutes of teasing.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBut what happens when those seconds become years and hiding turns into disappearing and seeking evolves into negotiations with armed rebels? Playing a child's game in Colombia is neither an innocent nor a fun affair.Colombia has suffered a chronic war against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) since 1964, when the group was formed. The country's largest rebel group has killed more than 220,000 people, while more than one out of every 10 Colombians have been forced from their homes.Out of the approximate 15,500 members of the guerrilla movement, an estimated 7,500 are child soldiers who were often kidnapped or forced into labor. Children have always played a central role in the operations of the FARC. The group uses girls and boys to install land-mines, transport explosives and kidnap hostages for ransom.After more than half a century of fighting and failed negotiations, last August the Colombian government and the rebels announced a final peace agreement, which has been signed but must still be ratified at a civil referendum in the coming days. As part of the deal, the FARC recently released 13 child soldiers from their ranks, turning them over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.This number might seem small, but it is important to know that many of the members that entered the FARC's ranks as child combatants are now adults.The careful reintegration of these girls and boys into society and into their families is essential for the future of Colombia. If the country wants a peaceful future it must give child soldiers a second chance at education, love and childhood.A kid whose innocence is stolen, whose right to education is violated and who is constantly exploited is unlikely to become a healthy adult. The cycle of violence, despite any peace agreements, will not end. Violence leads to violence.It might seem that the welcoming of a child into his or her home is a fairly easy transition, even when coming from a guerrilla. However, one must consider the many years of abuse and systematic violence that the youth suffered and recognize that even if the army is not a real family, it is the only family these young soldiers know.Colombian families must be prepared to deal with the psychological traumas and physical injuries that their children have suffered. Oftentimes, mothers and fathers will have to forgive their children for leaving their homes and committing horrible crimes.If the reunification of families is successful, and the young fighters find a new and better place in society, Colombia might finally have a chance at a peaceful future.The peace agreement consists on a bilateral ceasefire, disarmament of the FARC and elimination of its illegal drug production. In exchange, the government promises land reform, allowing political participation by rebels and amnesty for combatants. Even though the deal has been established, it won't be implemented until the positive outcome of an October civil referendum.To be sure, there are legitimate concerns that FARC members may dishonor the agreement. Colombian voters must make sure not to reward violence but also learn to forgive and transition into peace, this is a very fine line that must be clearly drawn.Regardless of the fate of the agreement, the international community should take great pleasure in welcoming the reunification of Colombian families who have finally finished counting to ten and have welcomed their daughters and sons home.Lorenza Kuri Brena Rosillo is a graduate student at George Washington University.SIGN UP

Ted Cruz (R-TX) set a powerful example for conservatives, and all Americans, this week: he forgave Donald Trump for personal attacks during the Republican primary.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERPerhaps Cruz should have done so before the Republican convention in July. And perhaps he has his own political ambitions in mind. Nevertheless, it is never too late to do the right thing. And it is better to do the right thing, even if for the wrong reason, than not. Trump should do the same -- as should we all, in our own lives.This Sunday through Tuesday evening, we Jews will celebrate Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. Traditionally, the weeks leading up to Rosh Hashanah are a time for moral reflection, and for asking forgiveness from those whom we may have wronged during the course of the year, as well as from God. The annual process of repentance and reconciliation accelerates on Rosh Hashanah, and culminates on the fast day of Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, ten days later (Oct. 11-12).Earlier this year, in the throes of a Twitter debate about the alt-right, Commentary's John Podhoretz pulled religious rank on me, telling me I'd have much to repent for this Yom Kippur. I laughed it off at the time, but it's not an unfair question to ask oneself: Have I said or done anything to wrong others, in this contentious year?I've thought about that, and in the spirit of the season, I've written to several people to apologize -- regardless of whether they reciprocate. (I've had a couple of nice replies.)I've also decided to forgive people for things they said in anger, or in error. There is little point to holding grudges, especially political ones. I've tangled often with the NeverTrump crowd on Twitter, for example, but when I look at some of their posts, I find I agree with 99% of everything else most of them write.If people who share that much in common cannot look past a single political disagreement, then there is little hope for the conservative movement -- or for America as a whole, frankly.My friend Guy Benson wrote a column recently considering the question of blame, in the event that Donald Trump loses the election in November (though it looks, increasingly, like his chances are improving). Guy was defending himself, and other critics of Trump, from the argument that they will be to blame, so I do not want to be harsh in criticizing his approach. And I agree with him: if Trump loses, it won't be NeverTrump's fault. (There are too few of them in any case.)But I disagree with Guy when he argues that others should, in fact, be blamed instead -- ""[t]hose who actively aided and abetted Trump's rise, and who used their conservative credibility to promulgate the fiction that he is something other than what he has clearly demonstrated himself to be over several decades of public life."" He adds later: ""A Trump loss would rest squarely on the shoulders of the candidate, his campaign, and the people who thought it was a good idea to nominate him"" (emphasis added).It is unclear to me why people who simply argue for a candidate bear moral culpability. People have the right to advocate and vote for a candidate. We are allowed to be wrong.Guy's argument would make more sense on the Democratic side, where the party leaders actively colluded to ensure no one but Hillary Clinton could win the nomination. They are morally responsible if she loses -- and also if she wins. But Trump ran against the party. He won the nomination with votes alone.It is difficult to see what benefit can come from assigning blame to either side of the pro-Trump/NeverTrump divide. Politics is ultimately a game of numbers: why would you want fewer allies?There is more to gain from forgiveness than from blame. I would save moral outrage for those people -- thankfully, few -- who behave dishonestly in pushing their views, or who insist on personal attacks rather than political arguments. (And even they deserve a chance -- not indefinite, mind you -- to repent.)After all, there is more that unites us conservatives than divides us, and the fights are both exhausting and pointless. Norman Podhoretz recently came out for Trump; is John Podhoretz expected to dismiss his own father? It seems best for conservatives to forgive -- and to start now, before the election. Winning, of course, would help our divisions to subside, if not disappear.Regardless, forgiveness has the moral power to strengthen us, and our country -- if we have the courage to offer and seek it.Joel B.

Ambassador and American Enterprise Institute senior fellow John Bolton discussed the latest developments on the international scene, including the congressional override of President Obama's veto against the bill allowing 9/11 families to file suit against Saudi Arabia.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERMarlow mentioned a military family asking President Obama why he refuses to use the phrase ""radical Islamic terrorism"" at a forum the previous day, a predilection that prevents his administration from ""forming a coherent strategy"" because they ""don't understand what the threat is,"" in Bolton's estimation:I don't know what he said yesterday, but I think the real reason that he won't use the phrase is because of his disdain for the American people. He thinks they're so foolish, so stupid, that if he says ""radical Islamic terrorism,"" they'll forget the ""radical"" part, they'll forget the ""terrorist"" part; it'll just be anti-Islamic.The Muslims of the world have borne a substantial part of the brunt of radical Islamic terrorism. They understand they're in a civil war. King Abdullah of Jordan, for example, has referred to the struggle with the radicals in exactly that way. I think the person who doesn't get it, and doesn't understand it, is not the American people, it's Barack Obama.Wednesday brought the first override of an Obama presidential veto in eight years, by a nearly unanimous Senate vote, removing the President's obstruction to a bill that would allow 9/11 families to sue Saudi Arabia for involvement in the terrorist atrocity. Bolton strongly criticized that bill, describing it as a ""cruel hoax"" perpetrated on the families of 9/11 victims:Well, it will do two things. Number one, it will dramatically undermine America's position in the world since we are the country most present around the world in other countries. It's our people who need the protection of sovereign immunity, and we're now at risk of seeing that stripped away.Number two, the families are not going to get any relief here. The families are not going to find out anything more when they bring their litigation than they know now. They're not gonna get damages. They're not gonna get the satisfaction of seeing Saudi Arabia humiliated. Really, it's a cruel hoax being perpetrated on them. Watching Congress do that, it's no wonder their approval rating is at 15 percent.Marlow suggested some would enjoy seeing Obama rebuked by the lopsided veto override vote, but may not have considered the objections Bolton raised to the actual 9/11 relief bill. ""It certainly seems like one of those feel-good exercises that isn't necessarily going to pay dividends,"" he said.""If you believe that the Saudis were responsible, even in part, for the 9/11 attack, that's an act of war against the United States,"" Bolton pointed out, adding:President Bush treated it as an act of war when he overthrew the Taliban and al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. Think how pathetic it is to say the Saudis attacked the United States, and we're going to file a lawsuit against them. Imagine the horror of the Pearl Harbor attack, and people rushing to file lawsuits. It just is embarrassing for the United States.Furthermore, Bolton wondered if anyone seriously believes ""a lawsuit will find out more about what the Saudis did than our intelligence services in the past 15 years.""""Both Obama and George W.

If the Obama administration continues to bring Syrian refugees at that rate each month in Fiscal Year 2017, which begins on Saturday, the total number of arrivals from that war torn country would exceed 21,000.More than 99 percent of these Syrian refugees (12,470 of 12,571) are Muslim. Less than 1 percent (101 of 12,571) are Christians or other faiths.One official working for one of the politically powerful resettlement agencies who receive more than $1 billion annually from the federal government to resettle refugees recently said he expects the Obama administration will bring between 20,000 and 30,000 Syrian refugees in to the United States in FY 2017.News of the increase in Syrian refugees comes one day after an Obama administration official testified before Congress that, ""We anticipate that [the number of Syrian refugees arriving in FY 2017] will be above 12,500 but I don't have a number other than that.""Another official admitted to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) at the same Senate hearing that there is no reliable security data base for vetting Syrian refugees, and that Obama administration officials have merely been relying upon the word of arriving refugees that they are not terrorists.According to a statement released by Cruz's office:While questioning State Department Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Simon Henshaw, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Director Leon Rodriguez, and Department of Health and Human Services Director Robert Carey, Sen. Cruz specifically noted that the administration's willful blindness to radical Islamic terrorism has prevented Christian refugees from the Middle East from escaping the genocide of ISIS and has also seriously undermined counterterrorism efforts in the United States.Moreover, during an exchange with Sen. Cruz, Director Rodriguez acknowledged publicly that refugee applications can be approved based solely on the applicant's testimony, without any documentation.Sen.

It was not immediately clear what funding level is included in that temporary spending measure for arriving refugees.In FY 2015, 70,000 refugees arrived. In FY 2016 to date, a total of 84,870 refugees have arrived -- a total of 12,516 in September. At that run rate, more than 145,000 refugees will arrive in the United States in FY 2017.The Obama administration has proposed allowing 110,000 refugees to enter the United States in FY 2017, while resettlement agencies have lobbied for 200,000.The top ten states for Syrian refugee arrivals in FY 2016 to date, according to the Department of State's interactive website are:California - 1,438
Michigan - 1,374
Texas - 912
Arizona - 833
Pennsylvania - 745
Illinois - 727
Florida - 642
New York - 637
North Carolina - 603
Ohio - 504Oakland County, Michigan received 481 Syrian refugees in FY 2016, more than 40 states.Oakland County Executive L. Brooks Patterson has said he intends to sue the federal government to stop the resettlement of refugees in the county on the grounds that it has failed to comply with the consultation clause of the Refugee Act of 1980.While questioning State Department Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Simon Henshaw, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Director Leon Rodriguez, and Department of Health and Human Services Director Robert Carey, Sen. Cruz specifically noted that the administration's willful blindness to radical Islamic terrorism has prevented Christian refugees from the Middle East from escaping the genocide of ISIS and has also seriously undermined counterterrorism efforts in the United States.
Moreover, during an exchange with Sen. Cruz, Director Rodriguez acknowledged publicly that refugee applications can be approved based solely on the applicant's testimony, without any documentation.

(AP) -- The Latest on the commuter train that crashed into a station in New Jersey (all times local):5:15 p.m.The only person who died in the New Jersey train crash has been identified as a 34-year-old woman from Hoboken.The state medical examiner's office said Thursday that the victim is Fabiola Bittar de Kroon. Gov. Chris Christie says she had been standing on the platform when the train came barreling in and she was struck by debris.The New Jersey Transit train ran off the end of its track as it pulled into the Hoboken station during rush hour Thursday morning, smashing through a concrete-and-steel bumper.Cries and screams could be heard in the wreckage as emergency workers rushed to reach commuters in the tangle of twisted metal and dangling wires.More than 100 other people were injured. Christie says no one else is expected to die.--HOBOKEN, N.J. (AP) -- A rush-hour commuter train crashed through a barrier at the busy Hoboken station and lurched across the waiting area Thursday morning, killing one person and injuring more than 100 others in a tangle of broken concrete, twisted metal and dangling wires.People pulled chunks of concrete off pinned and bleeding victims, passengers kicked out windows and crawled to safety, and cries and screams could be heard in the wreckage at the station just across the Hudson River from New York City as emergency workers tried to reach trapped victims.The New Jersey Transit train ran off the end of its track as it pulled into the station, smashing through a concrete-and-steel bumper. It apparently knocked out pillars as it ground to a halt in the covered waiting area, collapsing a section of the roof onto the first car.""All of a sudden, there was an abrupt stop and a big jolt that threw people out of their seats. The lights went out, and we heard a loud crashing noise - like an explosion - that turned out to be the roof of the terminal,"" said Ross Bauer, who was sitting in the third or fourth car when the train was pulling into the historic 109-year-old station for its final stop. ""I heard panicked screams, and everyone was stunned.""The engineer was pulled from the badly mangled first car of the train and hospitalized in critical condition. He was cooperating with investigators, Gov. Chris Christie said.A woman standing on the platform was killed by debris, and 108 others were injured, mostly on the train, Christie said. Seventy-four of them were hospitalized, some in serious condition, with injuries that included broken bones, bumps and gashes.""The train came in at much too high rate of speed, and the question is: 'Why is that?'"" Christie said. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said investigators will determine whether the explanation was an equipment failure, an incapacitated engineer, or something else.The National Transportation Safety Board sent investigators. Among other things, they will want to know what the operator was doing before the crash and whether the person was distracted, said Bob Chipkevich, who formerly headed the NTSB train crash investigations section.None of NJ Transit's trains are fully equipped with positive train control, a safety system designed to prevent accidents by automatically slowing or stopping trains that are going too fast. The industry is under government orders to install PTC, but the deadline has been repeatedly extended by regulators at the request of the railroads. The deadline is now the end of 2018.""While we are just beginning to learn the cause of this crash, it appears that once again an accident was not prevented because the trains our commuters were riding lacked positive train control,"" said Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y. ""The longer we fail to prioritize investing in rail safety technology, the more innocent lives we put in jeopardy.""But both Cuomo and Christie said that it is too soon to say whether such technology would have made a difference in this crash.The train was not equipped with an inward-facing camera in the cab that could give a fuller picture of the operator's actions.The Hoboken Terminal, which handles more than 50,000 train and bus riders daily, is the final stop for several train lines and a transfer point for many commuters on their way to New York City. Many take ferries or PATH commuter trains across the river to the city.NJ Transit service was suspended in and out of Hoboken, all but assuring a difficult trip home for commuters. Christie said engineers were examining the station's structural integrity and it was too soon to say when it might reopen to NJ Transit trains.William Blaine, an engineer for a company that runs freight trains, was inside the station when the train crashed and ran over to help. He walked over to the heavily damaged first car with a transit employee to check on the train's engineer and said he found him slumped over the controls.The train had left Spring Valley, New York, at 7:23 a.m. and crashed at 8:45 a.m., authorities said. NJ Transit spokeswoman Jennifer Nelson said she didn't know how fast the train was going when it crashed through the barrier.Jamie Weatherhead-Saul, who was standing at a door between the first and second cars, said the train didn't slow down as it entered the station. She said the impact hurled passengers against her. One woman got her leg caught between the doors before fellow riders managed to pull her up, Weatherhead-Saul said.Michael Larson, an NJ Transit employee who was working in the terminal about 30 feet away, said he saw the train come in fast, go over the concrete-and-steel barrier called a bumper block, and lift up into the air, stopping only when it hit the wall of the station's indoor waiting area.As the train hurtled into the depot amid concrete dust and dangling electrical wires, ""I couldn't believe what I was seeing,"" he said.Half the first car was destroyed, with some passengers crawling to try to escape, Larson said. He said he helped a few riders get out before emergency works arrived.More than 100,000 people use NJ Transit trains to commute from New Jersey into New York City daily.A crash at the same station on a PATH commuter train injured more than 30 people in 2011. The train crashed into bumpers at the end of the tracks on a Sunday morning.The Hoboken Terminal was built in 1907 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.Several trauma and emergency units at scene after #NJTransitcrashes into Hoboken station https://t.co/uerYBWGfeo pic.twitter.com/KX4gcCVhLH

According to Ynet news, a short item on the former president's death was published before being promptly removed.

12	http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/09/29/linda-tripp-reopens-vince-foster-filegate-travelgate-scandals/	EXCLUSIVE: Linda Tripp Reopens Vince Foster, Filegate, Travelgate, Whitewater Scandals	"NEW YORK -- As a White House staffer who worked directly adjacent to Hillary Clinton's second floor West Wing office, Linda Tripp was afforded a front row seat to some of the most infamous scandals to rock the Bill Clinton White House.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERTripp possesses insider information on the scandals known as Travelgate, Filegate and Whitewater, and she personally witnessed the handling of documents from Vince Foster's office the morning after the Deputy White House Counsel was found dead in an apparent suicide. Foster was heavily involved in defending the Clintons in the Travelgate, Filegate and Whitewater cases. Tripp was the last person known to have spoken to Foster before his death.In an exclusive interview, Tripp reopened each of those scandals - Travelgate, Filegate, Whitewater and the issues surrounding Vince Foster's death - and she used her unique vantage point to explain how the notorious cases foreshadowed many of the current Clinton controversies, from the Clinton Foundation to Hillary Clinton's private email server troubles.Tripp spoke in an hour-long interview set to air in full on this reporter's Sunday night talk radio program, ""Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,"" broadcast on New York's AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM in Philadelphia.Tripp is well-known for her role in the Monica Lewinsky scandal, documenting evidence of the young intern's relationship with Bill Clinton and submitting the documentation to independent counsel Kenneth Starr, leading to the public disclosure of the affair.However, many people may be surprised to learn of Tripp's larger role in the West Wing, and her firsthand experiences behind the curtain of the Clinton scandal machine.Tripp was brought to the Clinton administration from the George H.W. Bush White House, where she served as executive assistant to the deputy chief of staff to the president, a role that enabled her to become familiar with the inner workings of the West Wing.During the Clinton administration, she first served as support staff to the Immediate Office of the President, where she sat just outside Bill Clinton's Oval Office. After three months, Foster asked Tripp to work for the White House Counsel's office as executive assistant to White House Counsel Bernie Nussbaum, who played a lead role in defending the Clintons in their infamous scandals.No respect for classified, sensitive documentsAs a crossover staffer from the Bush White House, Tripp explained that she observed significant differences in the manner in which classified material was handled by both the Clinton and Bush administrations. She personally witnessed behavior that may have foreshadowed Clinton's future email issues in which the presidential candidate sent sensitive data over her personal server and later deleted about 30,000 emails.During the Bush administration, Tripp said that ""everything I had to come to know as protocol for the handling of classified information was followed very strictly... In the Bush White House, classification was critical, followed and adhered to with great, great detail.""In contrast, Tripp says, she observed a ""cavalier, loosey-goosey, this isn't important, don't be a prude [attitude]"" toward the handling of sensitive information.""Because I would often bring up the fact that this had to happen. That this was not a luxury. This was a necessity. And classified material is just part and parcel of working in the West Wing of the White House on a daily basis,"" she explained. ""So there was sort of a disregard for any of the rules. They certainly didn't apply to them. And that was startling.""One of several examples Tripp cited during our interview was the manner in which the Clinton White House handled the processing of comprehensive security and background checks for incoming aides and advisors.She explained:""When the Clintons came in, I think one thing that was very startling right from the beginning was in order to even work in the West Wing you have to have an extremely comprehensive background security review. And it is generally a 90-day process. It costs thousands upon thousands of dollars per person. And at the end of that time you receive your security clearance at whatever level you are secured. Mine was top secret and above.""Also just as an example, ...when I got to the Bush White House I couldn't even enter the West Wing even though I was hired to support the West Wing until my 90-day security review had been completed.""Now in the Clinton White House it was a year before I would say 95% of the senior advisors to President Clinton and their support staff in the West Wing even filled out the paperwork.""Filegate: Hillary and her 'sense of paranoia'The White House FBI files controversy, also known as ""Filegate,"" revolved around the West Wing wrongly accessing FBI security-clearance documents on hundreds of current and former government employees, including Republican figures such as former top Republican presidential advisors.During our interview, Tripp discussed what she observed with regard to Filegate and the scandal's pivotal actor, Craig Livingstone, director of the White House's Office of Personnel Security. Livingstone ultimately resigned from his position amid rumours he was not qualified for the position; that Hillary Clinton personally requested and read the files; and that Livingstone was put in charge of personal security at Clinton's behest.Tripp viewed Hillary Clinton's alleged involvement in accessing the secretive files as ""a great example of how she perceives life in general. There's a huge sense of them-versus-us. A huge sense of paranoia. A huge hatred of Republicans. And it's mind-boggling.""Tripp knew Livingstone fairly well from her position inside the West Wing. She questioned Livingstone's qualifications, explaining he was ""known as someone during the '92 campaign who had dressed up as a chicken and heckled the first President Bush at his campaign stops.""""And he was also known as an intricate part of their opposition research,"" Tripp continued. ""So essentially coming up with negative information about the first President Bush during that campaign.""She added:""The reason that I had anything to do with him was that the chief of White House security in a loose way reported to the counsel to the president (Bernie Nussbaum), who was my boss. But Craig Livingstone was a former bar bouncer. That was his claim to fame. So the notion that this former bar bouncer was the chief of White House security was beyond chilling to anyone who knew how that office functioned in the previous administration.""It just defied comprehension. And worse, his claim was that he was hired by Hillary. And Bernie (Nussbaum) knew nothing about that. Bernie had no idea how he was hired. He just knew that that was his job.""...And these were all files of perceived Clinton enemies. They were all Republicans. And what was so chilling about that was Craig Livingstone himself having essentially ownership of these raw data FBI Files.""Tripp says Filegate, especially the mistreatment of sensitive information, was a sampling of a larger pattern that continues to this day.""I don't think sensitive material - or classified information, for that matter - was something they considered at all. And I know that is a strong statement to make,"" Tripp said. ""But I believe that what was more important to Mrs. Clinton was control. Control of the information flow. The ability to smear those who would speak against them. And the ability to control the message. So classification wasn't a big deal and I think you can see that and what has happened just this past year. With what happened at the state Department. It is really just a continuation of a pattern.""Vince Foster Death Episode: Hillary oversaw document siftingThe death of Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster on July 20, 1993 shocked the nation.His untimely death came as Bill and Hillary Clinton were being investigated for the White House travel office controversy, also known as Travelgate, the first major public controversy for the Clinton administration.Foster was found dead in Virginia's Fort Marcy Park with an autopsy concluding the cause of death was a ""perforating gunshot wound mouth-head.""Five official or governmental investigations concluded that he committed suicide. The nature of Foster's work, as well as the six days it took before Foster's suicide note was found, led to speculation and conspiracies about his death.""He was the one who was to oversee everything from Whitewater to Travelgate, to Filegate, to everything that had anything to do with any of these scandals,"" recalled Tripp. ""Regardless of whether these scandals had occurred before they got to the White House or after.""Tripp recalled receiving a phone call from Bill Clinton's secretary at around midnight the night that Foster died, and ""it was just a complete tragedy.""""My first question to the president's secretary when she called and said, 'Vince is dead. He killed himself' -- my first question was, how did you know he killed himself? This was midnight. I was in bed. It was just so surreal.""Things became ""unusual and noteworthy from that point on,"" she said.Tripp says she was shocked to show up for work the next day to find Foster's office not only unsecured, but with a White House staffer inside, handling documents.She said the office should have been secured because ""at that point, there was no definitive conclusion as to how he had died. At that point one would have assumed it was still an investigation.""Regarding the sifting of documents, Tripp stated: ""When I arrived, Bernie's other assistant was literally in Vince's office going through papers... And I just couldn't understand how she couldn't understand that this had to be a secured scene.""I asked whether she saw the assistant remove any documents.""I didn't,"" she replied. ""I asked the question and she said she was straightening his office and then later I think it was said that she may have been looking for a suicide note. I don't know. I don't attribute any nefarious intent to her. I just felt at the time and strongly felt and believed that this was inappropriate and that we had a duty and an obligation to preserve whatever evidence might be there.""""But you know, again, it's just another sort of example of a systemic problem that existed in the Clinton White House. The rules don't apply. Ever,"" she added.Tripp says she was the one who called Secret Service to finally secure Foster's workspace:""I just couldn't understand how she (Bernie Nussbaum's assistant) couldn't understand that this had to be a secured scene. For many reasons but certainly because this was a suspicious death at that point. Of a senior adviser to the President of the United States. So in the midst of all the closed-door sessions and the back and forth, finally I called the Secret Service and said, could you send someone up to cordon off the office and to post a guard.""The real ""scandal"" of Foster's death was the removal of documents from the Counsel's offices following the suicide, Tripp continued, adding that it was Hillary Clinton who was personally leading those efforts:""Hillary oversaw everything that followed in the aftermath of Vince Foster's death. Hardly mourning, she sprang into action like a field commander. The very night he died, her aides were packing up and moving boxes of files to the residence. Some never surfaced for years, including the Rose Law Firm Billing records which were under subpoena. They mysteriously surfaced years later in the Residence of the White House, at a time where it made little difference. What should have made a difference is that these law firm billing records showed definitively how extensive her involvement was in the Whitewater mess, something she had denied under oath.""Foster's death was a watershed moment for the Clinton West Wing, Tripp explained. ""From then on in everything changed,"" she said.Tripp continued:""I mean literally from one minute to the next. Bernie's office had been an open-door policy. After that, his door was always closed. And the most trusted soldiers in the counsel's office would huddle in there for days on end. And one of those was Cheryl Mills, who long ago swore a blood oath to the Clintons. And to this day, I am sure people may have heard her name as being involved in the email scandal.""Tripp singled out Mills as being ""extremely instrumental in the days that followed"" Foster's passing.She mused at how Mills is continually involved in allegedly helping to scrub Clinton scandals, from the Clinton Foundation to Emailgate.""The interesting thing about Cheryl Mills -- and again this is getting down in the weeds where most people are just probably not aware of it -- but you will recall the Justice Department allowed Cheryl Mills, who was a witness, if not a subject to the email investigation, to invoke attorney-client privilege in order to thwart the attempt to gain information about Clinton's emails.""And she was literally a participant in that procedure. She oversaw the destruction by bleaching of the emails. She was a critical player and still is. But it's interesting because when she was at the State Department, she was Hillary's chief of staff but she was not acting in the capacity of a lawyer.""And with her involvement personally with Clinton's private email setup, it's amazing that she was an actor in the facts that are literally under criminal investigation by the FBI. And yet she was allowed to sit in on Hillary's FBI investigation as a lawyer. She should never have been allowed to be a participant as a lawyer. A few years after they both left the state department. But she was allowed to do that.""Mills was also offered limited immunity in the email probe.Whitewater: Obstruction of JusticeTripp addressed the investigations into Whitewater, controversial real estate investments by the Clintons and two associates who together formed a failed company, the Whitewater Development Corporation, which was utilized to make the at-times shady investments.Immediately following Foster's death, White House senior officials reportedly removed files from Foster's office, including those pertaining to the Whitewater real estate investments.During our interview, Tripp stated that ""there was a White House task force with very loyal folks who worked on a daily basis to ensure that no one, no controlling legal authority at all, had unfettered access to documents or information having to do with Whitewater.""Tripp views the Whitewater controversy as ""all of a piece.""She stated:""From what I can see from my vantage point, Whitewater appeared to be a sleazy land deal with questionable players. And Hillary at the Rose Law Firm being personally involved and professionally involved representing some of the sleazy characters. She didn't want any of that to get out. You know, one of the driving forces, sort of a dual quest for unparalleled power, unquestioned power and the accumulation of vast wealth.""And Whitewater was just a get-rich-quick scheme that was questionable at best that shows sort of the incestuous garbage that was going on in Arkansas, of which they were a part. And she wanted no one to have access to this information.""Tripp opined that the ""real"" Whitewater scandal, ""aside from highlighting an element of sleaze, was the enormous steps that Hillary took to ensure that essentially obstruction of justice went on.""""So this was an enormously expensive exercise to the taxpayer. And completely unnecessary had she just provided the documents to begin with,"" Tripp added.MotivesAfter the public disclosure of the Lewinsky affair, the news media largely attempted to paint Tripp as a disloyal friend motivated by money; a greedy opportunist who betrayed an impressionable young woman purportedly in a bid to sell a book. The media spin machine went into overdrive, unfairly condemning her as the villain in an attempt to frame Clinton's behavior as adulterous rather than predatory and abusive.This narrative falls apart on many levels, especially now, with the benefit of hindsight.""The money I might have made on a book would never have overtaken what I gave up. My career. My pension. I was making a very decent salary. There was just no way that a book could have made up for what I would lose,"" Tripp said.""But the media, in an attempt I suppose to support the Clintons' perspective, painted me that way,"" she added. ""So there is very little the average layperson can do to fight that media saturation.""And Tripp never published a book, as she noted during our interview.""It's actually kind of humorous in a way, if it weren't so pathetically sad, that many of the members of the media who painted me as an avarice-driven, money-grubbing, horrible villain, themselves wrote best-selling books with their version of events. So I find that somewhat ironic.""Also, looking back, Tripp seems to be doing quite well without ever having profited financially from the Lewinsky affair. She and her husband own a successful small business, and reportedly live on a $3 million farm in rural Virginia.Her difficult decision to expose the Lewinsky affair was motivated in part out of concern for Lewinsky's well-being, she said. The intern was acting erratically toward the end of the affair and Bill Clinton had much to lose with a public disclosure in light of the Paula Jones lawsuit, Tripp said in a previous interview with me. And Tripp points out that before she went to Starr, Lewinsky had informed Bill Clinton that Tripp knew about their relationship, putting both Lewinsky and Tripp in the crosshairs of the Clinton machine.""I say today, and I will continue to say, that I believe Monica Lewinsky is alive today because of choices I made and action I took,"" she said. ""That may sound melodramatic to your listeners. I can only say that from my perspective, I believe that she and I at the time were in danger, because nothing stands in the way of these people achieving their political ends.""But perhaps most critically, Tripp points out that Clinton's treatment of Lewinsky was the straw that broke the camel's back, the misdeed that finally prompted Tripp to speak publicly after bearing witness to scandal after scandal, offenses mostly hidden from the public. Tripp said there were numerous instances in which she wanted to go public on other issues before the Lewinsky debacle, but in the end, she was too afraid.""The West Wing of the Clinton White House was scandal central, without a doubt,"" she said. ""But more importantly, it was a peak behind the corrupt curtain that few have ever seen and I don't think will see. And so I wanted to shout from the rooftops back then and expose what I witnessed.""But in the end, I was honestly too much of a coward to do anything at all and that was primarily because by that point I was a single parent,"" Tripp continued. ""And I had had a 20-plus year government career. I would have lost my retirement. My income. And I knew that it would not be a good outcome to say much. But it ended up being the president's horrific abuse of an emotionally fragile young girl not much older than my own children that finally tipped me over the edge. And that was years later.""Tripp says she is ""not the only one who witnessed all of this in the Clinton White House. But most remain silent. You know, those who dare to speak out are completely decimated. Their credibility is shredded. Their motivations are assailed.""Tripp said another issue Clinton whistleblowers had at the time was credibility, explaining the public perception of the Clinton White House was very different from that which she had experienced:""You know, it is very difficult for anyone who has seen behind the curtain to share that with the general population because I think generally they are so completely effective - and by them, I mean the Clintons - in their polished approach to politics to destroy anyone who would speak out against them.""...I always wondered why am I being exposed to all of this and the general public is seeing none of this? In fact, it was so black and white, topsy turvy, ""Alice in Wonderland""-like because virtually everything the public heard was in direct opposition to what was true.""From old to new scandals...the Clinton legacyTripp stressed how the Clinton scandals of the 1990's foreshadowed many of the Clinton's future controversies.""The Clintons embody a culture of corruption,"" she said. ""And corruption can be insidious. A look at the President, the Attorney General and the FBI Director over this past year is illuminating. Their eager protection of all things Hillary could not be construed as anything other than political favoritism. On steroids. From the tortured interpretation of 'intent' by the FBI Director, to the irregularities at Justice, including the Attorney General's secret meeting with Bill Clinton on the tarmac, to President Obama's enthusiastic defense of Hillary during a supposed active and ongoing FBI investigation, it all becomes clear. In fact, President Obama and Hillary jetted off to a campaign event aboard Air Force One just as Director Comey was announcing his long-awaited findings. This unnerving split screen optic would simply never have been allowed to occur had there been any doubt of the outcome.""The politicization of a federal criminal investigation should be alarming,"" she concluded. ""That they may well have used the power of their offices to control and manipulate the outcome of a presidential election seems a distinct possibility. In America. The intent seemed to be to ensure Hillary's ultimate triumph over an opponent those in power found unsuitable. That used to be the exclusive right of the American people. And that is the Clinton legacy.""Aaron Klein is Breitbart's Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter. He is a New York Times bestselling author and hosts the popular weekend talk radio program, ""Aaron Klein Investigative Radio."" Follow him on Twitter @AaronKleinShow. Follow him on Facebook.""When the Clintons came in, I think one thing that was very startling right from the beginning was in order to even work in the West Wing you have to have an extremely comprehensive background security review. And it is generally a 90-day process. It costs thousands upon thousands of dollars per person. And at the end of that time you receive your security clearance at whatever level you are secured. Mine was top secret and above.
""Also just as an example, ...when I got to the Bush White House I couldn't even enter the West Wing even though I was hired to support the West Wing until my 90-day security review had been completed.
""Now in the Clinton White House it was a year before I would say 95% of the senior advisors to President Clinton and their support staff in the West Wing even filled out the paperwork.""""The reason that I had anything to do with him was that the chief of White House security in a loose way reported to the counsel to the president (Bernie Nussbaum), who was my boss. But Craig Livingstone was a former bar bouncer. That was his claim to fame. So the notion that this former bar bouncer was the chief of White House security was beyond chilling to anyone who knew how that office functioned in the previous administration.
""It just defied comprehension. And worse, his claim was that he was hired by Hillary. And Bernie (Nussbaum) knew nothing about that. Bernie had no idea how he was hired. He just knew that that was his job.""
...And these were all files of perceived Clinton enemies. They were all Republicans. And what was so chilling about that was Craig Livingstone himself having essentially ownership of these raw data FBI Files.""""Hillary oversaw everything that followed in the aftermath of Vince Foster's death. Hardly mourning, she sprang into action like a field commander. The very night he died, her aides were packing up and moving boxes of files to the residence. Some never surfaced for years, including the Rose Law Firm Billing records which were under subpoena. They mysteriously surfaced years later in the Residence of the White House, at a time where it made little difference. What should have made a difference is that these law firm billing records showed definitively how extensive her involvement was in the Whitewater mess, something she had denied under oath.""""I mean literally from one minute to the next. Bernie's office had been an open-door policy. After that, his door was always closed. And the most trusted soldiers in the counsel's office would huddle in there for days on end. And one of those was Cheryl Mills, who long ago swore a blood oath to the Clintons. And to this day, I am sure people may have heard her name as being involved in the email scandal.""""The interesting thing about Cheryl Mills -- and again this is getting down in the weeds where most people are just probably not aware of it -- but you will recall the Justice Department allowed Cheryl Mills, who was a witness, if not a subject to the email investigation, to invoke attorney-client privilege in order to thwart the attempt to gain information about Clinton's emails.
""And she was literally a participant in that procedure. She oversaw the destruction by bleaching of the emails. She was a critical player and still is. But it's interesting because when she was at the State Department, she was Hillary's chief of staff but she was not acting in the capacity of a lawyer.
""And with her involvement personally with Clinton's private email setup, it's amazing that she was an actor in the facts that are literally under criminal investigation by the FBI. And yet she was allowed to sit in on Hillary's FBI investigation as a lawyer. She should never have been allowed to be a participant as a lawyer. A few years after they both left the state department. But she was allowed to do that.""""From what I can see from my vantage point, Whitewater appeared to be a sleazy land deal with questionable players. And Hillary at the Rose Law Firm being personally involved and professionally involved representing some of the sleazy characters. She didn't want any of that to get out. You know, one of the driving forces, sort of a dual quest for unparalleled power, unquestioned power and the accumulation of vast wealth.
""And Whitewater was just a get-rich-quick scheme that was questionable at best that shows sort of the incestuous garbage that was going on in Arkansas, of which they were a part. And she wanted no one to have access to this information.""""You know, it is very difficult for anyone who has seen behind the curtain to share that with the general population because I think generally they are so completely effective - and by them, I mean the Clintons - in their polished approach to politics to destroy anyone who would speak out against them.
""...I always wondered why am I being exposed to all of this and the general public is seeing none of this? In fact, it was so black and white, topsy turvy, ""Alice in Wonderland""-like because virtually everything the public heard was in direct opposition to what was true.""SIGN UP"

""How can you sue a country that is collaborating against the very same terrorism that they are baselessly being accused of?""Mustafa Alani, a senior adviser to the Gulf Research Center, suggested a review of the Saudi-US alliance.""Your financial investments have to be reduced in the US, your political and security cooperation has to be reduced,"" he said.A senior Saudi prince reportedly threatened to pull out billions of dollars of US assets if JASTA became law, though Saudi officials have distanced themselves from such threats.""It will be very difficult for Saudi Arabia to continue in intelligence cooperation when they take such a hostile position,"" said Jamal Khashoggi, a veteran Saudi journalist and analyst.He said Saudi officials are probably debating whether to act now or ""wait until the first suit is filed in some small town in America"".Khashoggi urged caution however.""It is important to have the Americans by our side"" to face threats in Syria, Yemen, and to counter Saudi Arabia's rival Iran, he said.The Congressional vote coincides with Western criticism of Saudi Arabia over civilian casualties from its air war against rebels in Yemen, its human rights record, and a fundamentalist Muslim ideology accused of fuelling violent Sunni extremism.- 'Arrow launched at own country' -Khashoggi said Saudi Arabia must ""look inside our own system, our own way of thinking"" and find a way to remove the kind of perceptions which led to the overwhelming Congressional vote.Obama opposed the law, saying it would harm US interests by undermining the principle of sovereign immunity, opening up the US to private lawsuits over its military missions abroad.The erosion of sovereign immunity is also a concern among the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, of which Saudi Arabia is the most powerful member.Saudi Arabia's Gulf allies have lined up beside Riyadh to criticise the law.United Arab Emirates Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan warned before the vote that the law ""will have negative effects on international cooperation in the fight against terrorism.""Bahrain's Foreign Minister Sheikh Khaled bin Ahmed al-Khalifa said on Twitter on Thursday that the law ""is an arrow launched by the US Congress at its own country"".He asked: ""Are there no rational people among you?""Still, Alani and others said they were not sure the Saudi government would be willing to immediately take steps that would jeopardise such a deep-rooted relationship.""It's not easy to have a U-turn,"" he said.SIGN UPRIYADH (AFP) -  "

They have taken what was, to a plurality of viewers, a narrow win for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and they have tried to inflate it to a massive victory.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERTheir agenda is obvious: voters like winners, so making Clinton an even bigger winner could be a way to improve her poll numbers. But the hyperbole is helping Trump set expectations that guarantee he wins the next two debates.As this author predicted, Trump would lose the first debate, largely because Clinton's health problems lowered expectations for her, even below where they had been for Trump. Initially, Trump faced lower expectations, because he is less experienced at debates. But after Clinton collapsed at the 9/11 memorial, some observers wondered whether she could stand through a full 90 minutes of debating. She did that -- with nary a cough. Moderator Lester Holt also weighed in heavily in Clinton's favor.Yet, as this author explained after the debate, Trump's loss in the first debate made it likely that he will win the second and third debates. There are five reasons. First, Trump will now benefit from low expectations in the second debate that carry over into the third, since his first win will still be seen as a fluke. Second, the moderators will be under pressure to be less biased than Holt was. Third, Trump will benefit from the town hall format in the second debate, because he has spoken more often to real voters than Clinton has done recently. Fourth, Trump has home field advantage in Las Vegas for the third debate. And fifth, Trump's improvement over time will show that he can learn on the job, as he will have to do in the White House.Had Trump actually melted down on Monday, as the New York Times' Charles Blow pretends, any mistakes in later debates would have reinforced that first impression. But because he was competent, even while losing, Trump set himself up for wins.Perhaps fearing a comeback, Trump's critics are trying to squeeze every possible advantage out of Clinton's win on Monday. But they are setting him up for even bigger wins -- and setting Clinton up for a fall.Take, for example, Paul Waldman, writing at The Week. He predicts that Clinton will win the second debate -- and his reasons come down to preconceived notions of the candidates: Trump as a blustering fool, Clinton as not only smart but also empathic. Waldman actually declares, without any irony, that ""relating to other humans one-on-one is something Hillary Clinton is actually very good at"" -- something that we know from opinion polls is not true, and which her campaign also knows is untrue, since they do not allow it to happen often.Waldman also argues Trump is incapable of learning or improvement. That flies in the face of Trump's improved polls since mid-August, when he became a more disciplined candidate.It also sets expectations so low Trump is certain to clear them.Joel B.

He was Treasury Secretary for President Bill Clinton, president of Harvard University from 2001 to 2006, and teaches there now.His new prediction of high unemployment is silent about the impact of high immigration. Immigration is a priority for the Democratic Party because it is bringing millions of people who're likely to vote Democratic in future elections.Currently, four million Americans turn 18 each year, and the federal government imports 2 million permanent or temporary foreign workers each year, including a few hundred thousand illegals.Jason Furman, who now heads Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, speaks more frankly about the huge problem of men who have fallen out of the workforce.Roughly 10 percent of American ""prime age"" men, or 7 million men aged 25 to 54, have dropped out of the nation's workforce of 150 million. They are not trying to get jobs and are not participating in the nation's labor force because of policy decisions, not because of technology, Furman said in August. ""This [dropout] is caused by policies and institutions, not by technology ... We shouldn't accept it as inevitable,"" he told a Brookings Institute expert, Dave Wessel on  August 10.But like Summers, Furman doesn't want to mention the federal government's policy of using immigration to artificially increase the new labor supply by roughly a third each year. In his Sept. 26 article in The Financial Times, Summers wrote;Job destruction caused by technology is not a futuristic concern ... everything we hear and see regarding technology suggests the rate of job destruction will pick up. Think of the elimination of drivers, and of those who work behind cash registers. Second, the gains in average education and health of the workforce over the last 50 years are unlikely to be repeated. Third, to the extent that non-work is contagious, it is likely to grow exponentially rather than at a linear rate. Fourth, declining marriage rates are likely to raise rates of labour force withdrawal given that non-work is much more common for unmarried than married men.What will this mean for the American family? ... For alienation and support for toxic populism? These are vital questions. Even more vital is the question of what is to be done. These questions should preoccupy social science researchers.In August, however, he suggested the fix to many social problems is a ""tight labor market,"" where unemployment is low and salaries are rising.Tight labour markets are the best social programme, as they force employers to hire the inexperienced: https://t.co/lQBXwltDks via @FT-- Lawrence H.

On the basis of these factors, I expect that more than one-third of all men in the US between 25 and 54 will be out work at mid-century. Very likely more than half of men will experience at least a year of non-work out of every five. This would be in the range of the rate of non-work for high school drop-outs and exceeds the rate of non-work for African Americans today.

""I was so disappointed with the people in Washington for allowing her to get away with it.""Not only did Clinton get away with deleting and bleaching her emails, she also destroyed 13 cellphones with a hammer, he said.In past campaign events, the New York City developer has talked about the Democratic nominee and her shady relationships and and he often used the line: ""She turned the State Department into her own hedge fund.""But, never before has Trump been so precise and focused on what he calls the ""the politics of profit.""Trump told his Hawkeye State supporters that the Clinton campaign has accepted $100 million dollars from Wall Street and the hedge funds.Trump leads the former first lady in Iowa according to polls.

Additionally, Harris reportedly received $15,000 from Planned Parenthood during her re-election campaign in 2014.Former Los Angeles district attorney Steve Cooley - who now represents Daleiden - referred to Harris' level of involvement in the Planned Parenthood legislation to punish undercover journalists as ""extraordinary.""""It is common to work on legislation pending before the California state legislature -- the attorney general's office does occasionally weigh in,"" Cooley said, according to the Times. ""It is extraordinary to collaborate with a particular entity on what is clearly legislation of specific benefit to them."" The U.S. Senate race in California features Harris running against fellow Democrat Rep. Loretta Sanchez, due to the state's ""jungle"" primary system. The RealClearPolitics polling average has Harris up by about 15 points.Lila Rose, president and founder of pro-life organization Live Action, calls Harris' involvement with Planned Parenthood to penalize journalists who expose the abortion giant's alleged criminal activity ""indefensible."" In a statement sent to Breitbart News, Rose said:Instead of investigating Planned Parenthood for trafficking in baby body parts, Kamala Harris reportedly has been secretly working with Planned Parenthood to write a law to criminalize the very investigative journalism that exposed those horrific injustices. Planned Parenthood is dismembering preborn children through abortion, and its CEO, Cecile Richards, even admitted in a letter to Congress that the corporation had accepted $60 for each child's organ it had harvested.""As attorney general, Kamala Harris is supposed to represent the people and uphold the law,"" Rose added. ""Instead, these emails show Harris is more interested in brazenly attacking the First Amendment and helping Planned Parenthood hide human rights abuses and potentially illegal and abusive activity from public view.""The documents are another indication of Ms. Harris' close relationship with Planned Parenthood and call into question the impartiality of her ongoing investigation of Mr. Daleiden, legal experts said.
The emails show Beth Parker, chief legal counsel for Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, sending multiple drafts of AB 1671 to Jill Habig, who was at the time special counsel to the attorney general.
""Attached is the language for AB 1671, proposed amendments to Penal Code section 632,"" Ms. Parker wrote in an email marked March 8. ""I look forward to your thoughts about this.""
Ms. Parker sent a revised draft of the legislation to Ms. Habig on March 16. ""Here's the rewrite of the video tape bill,"" she wrote.

Many of the latter believe that this new religious movement has added to Mexico's rise in violent crimes as well as demonic possessions.In his visit to Mexico last February, Pope Francis denounced the devotion to Santa Muerte, telling the Mexican bishops that he was particularly concerned about ""those many persons who, seduced by the empty power of the world, praise illusions and embrace their macabre symbols to commercialize death.""Andrew Chesnut, professor of religious studies at Virginia Commonwealth University, and author of Devoted to Death: Santa Muerte, the Skeleton Saint, said that the Pope's remarks were ""an obvious reference to the saint of death.""As ""the fastest growing new religious devotion in the Americas,"" Chesnut noted that the Pope ""called out Santa Muerte as a dangerous symbol of narco-culture.""""The Church views veneration of the Bony Lady as tantamount to Satanism since death is the antithesis of the eternal life that Jesus Christ made possible to believers,"" Chesnut said.The President of the Pontifical Council for Culture, Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi, has also condemned the cult of the skeleton saint as ""sinister and infernal"" and called for both Church and society to mobilize against devotion to Saint Death.""It's not religion just because it's dressed up like religion; it's a blasphemy against religion,"" he said.""Everyone is needed to put the brakes on this phenomenon, including families, churches and society in its totality,"" Ravasi said, adding that the Santa Muerte cult ""is the celebration of devastation and of hell.""Follow Thomas D.

Then lawmakers will have 30 days to block the sales, although such action is rare.Reuters reported earlier this month that the U.S. government was poised to approve the long-delayed sales to Kuwait and Qatar.The State Department said it could not comment on any ongoing government-to-government arms sales.Delays in the process had caused frustration among U.S. defense officials and industry executives, who warned that Washington's foot-dragging could cost them billions of dollars of business if buyers grew impatient and sought other suppliers.The approval of the fighter jet sales comes as the White House tries to bolster relations with Gulf Arab allies who want to upgrade their military capabilities. They fear the United States is drawing closer to Iran, their arch-rival, after Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers last year.Sources said officials at both the State Department and Pentagon had largely agreed to the deals some time ago, but had been awaiting final approval from the White House.Qatar, home to the largest U.S. air base in the Middle East, and Kuwait have ramped up military spending after uprisings across the Arab world and amid rising tensions between Sunni Muslim Gulf Arab states and Iran, the region's Shi'ite power.Both Qatar and Kuwait are part of a 34-nation alliance announced by Saudi Arabia in December aimed at countering Islamic State and al Qaeda militants in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Egypt and Afghanistan.The sales will boost fighter production for both companies.Boeing's F-15 line is set to close in 2019 after Boeing completes work on a large order for Saudi Arabia, unless a follow-on order is approved.As orders slow, Boeing is increasingly relying on technology upgrades and services sales to maintain its revenue stream from fighter jets, Shelley Lavender, president of Boeing's military aircraft division, said in an interview.The company is adding new technology to the F-15 and F/A-18 and other aircraft, and is refurbishing them on the same assembly lines use to build new aircraft, she said.When the current fighter jet lines end, that loss of revenue will be offset by upgrade efforts. ""We're blurring the traditional lines of new aircraft builds and sustainment,"" Lavender said.Boeing's broad portfolio from commercial derivatives rotocraft, autonomous vehicles, fighters and weapons ""will allow us to remain healthy for the decades to come,"" she said.Byron Callan with Capital Alpha Partner said he expected all three sales to be approved.SIGN UP"

Jerry Brown have added yet another layer of regulation to the road, with the passage and Monday signing of a bill that puts further restriction on use of a cell phone while behind the wheel.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAB 1785 prohibits a person from driving ""motor vehicle while holding and operating a handheld wireless telephone or an electronic wireless communications device unless the wireless telephone or electronic wireless communications device is specifically designed and configured to allow voice-operated and hands-free operation, and it is used in that manner while driving.""A small exception is made if a ""cell phone"" or ""wireless communications device"" is GPS-style mounted, dashboard mounted, or center console mounted. Then a ""single swipe or tap of the driver's finger"" is allowed if ""used to activate or deactivate a feature or function of the handheld wireless telephone or wireless communications device.""The penalty for violating this ban is $20 for a first offense and $50 for each subsequent offense. It is not clear from the bill whether the offense qualifies as a primary or secondary offense. The current law pertaining to using a cell phone to text while driving is a primary offense, according to the Governor's Highway Safety Administration. The handheld ban is a primary offense for all drivers under current law.Legislative Counsel's Digest of the bill also states that it ""would impose a state-mandated local program.""The bill is said to close some loopholes in laws currently on the books, such as taking pictures while driving and shooting streaming video.There is also an exception for ""an emergency services professional using an electronic wireless communications device while operating an authorized emergency vehicle, as defined in Section 165, in the course and scope of his or her duties.""California has had a ban on texting or listening and talking while driving since 2006 unless a hands-free device was used. In 2013 that was expanded to prohibit anyone younger than 18 from using a cell phone or wireless communications device even with the assistance of a hands-free device.In 2014 California's 5th District Court of Appeals ruled that current law only banned holding a wireless telephone while carrying on a conversation on it.Assembly Transportation Committee analysis of AB 1785 cited the California Department of Motor Vehicles when it stated, ""In 2015, there were 12 fatal collisions involving handheld cellphone use as an inattention factor, over 500 injury collisions, and nearly 700 property damage collisions. That same year, California Highway Patrol alone issued over 13,000 citations for violating the ban on writing, sending, or reading text-based communications while driving, and 78,000 citations for using a wireless telephone while driving.""The analysis goes on to state, ""Despite this level of enforcement, a study conducted in the spring of 2015 by the Office of Traffic Safety and UC Berkeley observed 9.2% of motorists using cell phones, up from 6.6% in 2014. To help combat the dangers of distracted driving, the most recent Strategic Highway Safety Plan (SHSP), prepared by the California Department of Transportation, recommends strengthening laws on distracted driving.""Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana SIGN UP"

Nor does Turkey, for its part, wish to break from the Turkish-Russian understandings that ushered in its intervention in northern Syria.Saudi Arabia and Qatar, however, are ready to pay for and provide the supplies immediately.""The Sunni bloc, chiefly Saudi Arabia, are alarmed at the prospect that Aleppo will fall,"" he said. ""They think it would instigate a domino effect that would demoralize the rebels and discredit them ... that's why they've been relentless in lobbying the US.""In parallel, he said, the Saudis and Qataris are pressuring the Front for the Liberation of Syria, formerly Nusra Front, to fully cut its ties with Al Qaeda and become full members of the coalition of opposition groups, especially in relation to its policy on peace negotiations.The source said that Washington has been reluctant to comply, fearing that the advanced weapons might end up in the possession of the Islamic State or some Nusra Front elements who are still committed to Al Qaeda.""But most of all they fear of the repercussions it may have on their relations with Russia,"" he said. ""The effect of a Russian jet downed by the rebels, using a missile provided by the Americans, will be devastating, as well as exacerbate the fighting. That's why, for now, it's out of the question for the administration.""He said that the missiles will not be provided by the US, but rather via third party Arab countries. He added that Israel, albeit sharing Saudi Arabia's concerns about Iran's growing influence in the region, adamantly opposes the notion of arming the rebels with antiaircraft missiles.It is widely understood that some Syrian rebel elements have already obtained and deployed the portable air defense systems known as MANPADs.SIGN UP"
