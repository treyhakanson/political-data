Both were brought to a stop on the adjacent side of the Signature facility.Hillary Clinton's motorcade left first. It consisted of several police motorcycles and cars, several SUVs, several vans, and several full-size buses. Donald Trump's motorcade -- significantly smaller, with police vehicles, several SUVs, and two small buses -- paused to allow them to pass.Members of the traveling press, amused, took video and photographs.Clinton headed to a rally in Raleigh, where she was to appear with her former rival from the Democratic primary, Sen.

Mike Pence, Sen. Chuck Grassley, and Rep. Steve King. Pence and Cruz held a small press conference before boarding the campaign plane for a rally in Portage, Michigan.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERMedia reporting on former 2016 presidential candidate Cruz's speech at the event honed in on an absence of the explicit use of the name of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. What Cruz did say, in part, was, ""If you care about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, if you care about free speech and religious liberty and the Second Amendment, then this election, putting a Republican in the White House and keeping a Republican Senate, is the whole enchilada. We are one liberal [Supreme Court] Justice away from losing our constitutional rights.""At a small joint press event with Pence and Cruz after the rally and just outside the Trump-Pence plane, Cruz made the following comments when asked about whether he was excited for Trump to become president:I'm here campaigning for Donald Trump, for Mike Pence.I recognize some of you guys are wanting to write stories suggesting divisions among Republicans. I'll make a point, I'm getting ready to get on a gigantic airplane that has Donald Trump's name painted on the side of it.On Monday of this week I voted for Donald Trump. I voted for Mike Pence and I'll tell you, we're just a few days away from election day and I'm doing everything I can to defeat Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton would be an absolute disaster as president. I'm doing everything I can to keep a Republican majority in the Senate.As Mike pointed out I think there are many issues front and center in this election, but none is more important than the U.S. Supreme Court.Pence endorsed Cruz in the Republican presidential primary, just before the Indiana primary election. Cruz was the closest competitor to Trump in the race for the Republican presidential nomination. Pence was later chosen as Trump's running mate. Cruz spoke at the Republican National Convention where Trump and Pence officially accepted their party's nomination. He did not endorse Trump at the time, but later, after Trump expanded his list of potential nominees to the U.S. Supreme Court -- which included Cruz friend Sen. Mike Lee -- Cruz endorsed Trump.Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana I'm here campaigning for Donald Trump, for Mike Pence.

They're all cracking up under the pounding of your brothers near the border of the Welayat [region]."" He further gave updates about alleged victories in the outskirts of Mosul, where Iraqi forces admitted they met formidable resistance.Fighter Abu Talha Aljazrawi wrote: ""Thanks to Allah, we are confident in our sons the mujahideen. We are here deep inside the region of Ninveh, waiting impatiently for our turn to take part in jihad for Allah, the one and only. We swear in the name of Allah to parade the heads of the nonbelievers and Shi'ites in the center of Mosul. We're not afraid and won't let their airplanes frighten us. They have America on their side, we have Allah on ours.""The app user who goes by the name of Mossab Almuhajer resorted to Islamic theology: ""The speech of Allah does not allow the men of evil to defeat the believers. We set up Allah's faith on earth, but it is likely that Allah allowed evil to win because he wants to shame them, and wants to delay the victory of the believers to separate them [from the nonbelievers]... We promise you will find us tomorrow on the ramparts of Baghdad... You rely on the airplanes of the coalition, we are confident nothing can harm us, except what Allah has planned for us.""Usama Almaghrebi (""the Moroccan"") wrote: ""We left our countries to fight for the victory of Allah's faith...

We're ready and waiting for them. I swear to Allah that neither America nor any other country could help them. We will annihilate them. They will take Mosul only after all of us are killed in the name of Allah. The mujahideen are racing for places on the explosive car, they get on and shout: 'I can smell heaven already!'

4	4	http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/11/03/fishbowl-politics-reduces-donald-trump-polling-support/	Rigged Polls: Tests Show College Grads Conceal Support For Donald Trump	"A large percentage of college graduates are hiding their support for Donald Trump, according to test surveys of 309 college graduates conducted by Morning Consult. SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThat hidden support for Trump could be providing Hillary Clinton a false, 2-point advantage in election polls, according to the polling firm's results. The public's practice of hiding support for Trump comes as the Internet's expansion helps progressives identify and penalize the professionals and other white-collar Americans who privately champion conservative policies and ideas. Even high-status professionals, such as software designer Brendan Eich, have been exposed, outed and professionally harmed in his Internet-enabled era of ""fishbowl politics"" after angering peers who are progressives. The Morning Consult survey used two tests. One test quizzed 1,249 people in a phone interview, another test quizzed 825 people online via a computer. The combined survey reached 309 college graduates and 388 people with incomes above $50,000.Among the college graduates reached for the person-to-personal test, only 39 percent told pollsters they backed Trump. But Trump got 46 percent support from college graduates who participated in the online test. That means the two tests of 309 college graduates showed a 14-point switch from Clinton and Trump, so reducing an apparent 21-point support gap down to a seven-point support gap. This huge shift was repeated among the overlapping group of 388 voters who earn more than $50,000 per year. This group showed a 11-point shift away from Clinton and towards Trump. According to Morning Consult,On the phone, Trump trails Clinton by 10 points, 54 percent to 44 percent, among voters in households which earn more than $50,000. But in online surveys, Trump leads Clinton by 1 point, 50 percent to 49 percent, among those voters.This hidden support for Trump won't have a huge impact on national polls, says Morning Consult, because the 7 percent slice of college graduates only comprise 1 percent of the the nation's electorate. That two-point shift is ""not statistically significant,"" says the polling firm, which describes the threatened and intimidated Trump supporters with a condescending term, ""shy Trumpers.""The survey was done with Politico, which also dismissed the results, even though Politico acknowledged a real-world difference in average results from in-person polls and automatic polls. According to Politico, there is ""an emerging disparity in the public polling: Hillary Clinton leads Trump by 4 percentage points in national, live-interview phone polls, according to HuffPost Pollster's average as of Wednesday night -- but only by 2.6 points in online and automated phone polls.""The evidence of 'fishbowl politics' in national elections follows a long series of news stories about academics and other professionals being fired, stigmatized or punished for conserving ""classical liberal"" ideas about individual rights and free speech, amid progressive demands for imposed diversity, group rights and ""politically correct"" stigmatization of classical American ideas. Unlike companies, which use advertising, low prices and new products to win sales in a dog-eat-dog free market, professionals rely on friendships with other professionals to win contracts, clients and status. That makes professionals very vulnerable to threats and punishments from even a minority of their peers. Business executives at companies tend to downplay political disagreements because they tend to measure their personal success via the non-political measure of their company's collective profit-and-loss. But outside the dog-eat-dog of marketplace competition, some professionals choose to measure their success by advancing a progressive claim, especially if they have a very personal connection to the progressive claim. These fishbowl politics seem to be particularly prominent for people in government-funded universities. For example, a tenured professor at New York University was recently forced out out his job by his peers for challenging progressive hegemony at the university. According to the New York Post: An NYU professor crusading against political correctness and student coddling was booted from the classroom last week after his colleagues complained about his ""incivility,"" The Post has learned.Liberal studies prof Michael Rectenwald, 57, said he was forced Wednesday to go on paid leave for the rest of the semester.""They are actually pushing me out the door for having a different perspective,"" the academic told The Post.Rectenwald launched an undercover Twitter accountcalled Deplorable NYU Prof on Sept. 12 to argue against campus trends like ""safe spaces,"" ""trigger warnings"" policing Halloween costumes and other aspects of academia's growing PC culture.He chose to be anonymous, he explained in one of his first tweets, because he was afraid ""the PC Gestapo would ruin me"" if he put his name behind his conservative ideas on the famously liberal campus.The pressure is also imposed in the workplace by individual progressives, especially university-educated women, according to a new survey by Pew. According to the survey:nearly six-in-ten registered voters who back Clinton (58%) say they have a ""hard time"" respecting someone who supports Trump for president; 40% say they have ""no trouble"" with it. Nearly the opposite is true among Trump supporters, with 56% saying they have no trouble respecting someone who backs Clinton and 40% saying they do have trouble with it.The poll showed that 68 percent of Clinton's white female supporters, and 66 percent of college graduates who support Clinton, have a ""hard time"" respecting Trump's conservative supporters.The progressive pressure is being amped up by progressive leaders, including Clinton, who declared Sept. 9 that:You know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic -- you name it. And unfortunately there are people like that. And he has lifted them up ... some of those folks, they are irredeemable, but thankfully they are not America.In contrast, conservative voters are far more comfortable when dealing with Clinton supporters, according to the Pew survey.Other pollsters also report evidence that Trump supporters hide from pollsters.

A suspicion of terrorism was immediate, and that suspicion was only strengthened by the evidence discovered and reported each passing hour.On the morning of December 3, Schwerin wrote, ""For the town hall topper this afternoon, I think we should drop all gun references. The story is moving more and more toward terrorism and it seems like by riffing on guns just now she looked a little behind the curve.""Of course, this did not mean that Clinton's campaign opposed using a terror attack to push gun control. Rather, Schwerin was stressing that Clinton looked like she did not understand what was happening; she appeared to have missed the terror aspect of the attack.Just days after Schwerin's email, the Clinton campaign reworked the San Bernardino gun control approach, placing references to gun control in a speech about defeating the Islamic State (ISIS). The speech references, also contained in an email released by WikiLeaks, revolved around expanding background checks to include the no-fly list and/or terror watch lists. It contained the quote, ""If you're too dangerous to fly in America, you are too dangerous to buy a gun in America.""Notably, neither San Bernardino attacker was on a watch list of any kind, so Clinton's gun control suggestion would have done nothing to prevent or even hinder the attack.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of ""Bullets with AWR Hawkins,"" a Breitbart News podcast.

Moerman even claims some prison employees acted as lookouts to make sure no one interrupted the sessions.The suit goes on to charge that prison officials neglected to stop the rapes.""Defendants failed to provide Mr. Moerman humane conditions of confinement by knowingly, voluntarily, recklessly, and with willful disregard to Mr. Moerman's personal safety, allowing him to be sexually assaulted and raped,"" the suit says.Moerman also charges that the prison counselor underwent fertility treatment to assure he impregnated her.According to records, therapist Clingerman and the prisoner were caught in the act of having sex in September of 2014. The woman later admitted to having sexual relations with the prisoner and informed her superiors that she had become pregnant with Moerman's child.Clingerman also said in a statement that she knew what she was doing was wrong. ""I did not know I could be prosecuted for this,"" she wrote. ""I knew I could get into trouble -- including firing.""The therapist has since had her social worker license revoked and was fired by the prison system.Clingerman pleaded guilty to a felony charge of misconduct in office to stay off the sex offender registry.

Kadzik gave Podesta a potential timeline for the State Department to post work emails -- which Clinton sent and received over an unsecure, homebrew email server -- that she turned over years after leaving her position as Secretary of State. Kadzik apparently sent this message through a Gmail account and not his .gov address.Shortly after seeing this email, Breitbart News contacted the DoJ via email and phone but spokesmen failed to comment. The department's silence also extended to several establishment outlets, including Bloomberg, Politico, and CNN.Fox News received a response from a DoJ spokesman who signaled that the federal agency, led by Attorney General Loretta Lynch, does not see the incident as unethical. Fox reporter Cody Derespina writes:A Justice Department spokesman, though, downplayed the significance of Kadzik's 2015 email, saying it was ""about public information"" and sent ""in his personal capacity, not during work hours.""""He wasn't communicating via official channels because it wasn't official business,"" Kevin Lewis told FoxNews.com.

However, the FOIA development was not public information. Other Wikileaks emails show that an unnamed Justice Department employee leaked a document with this information to the Clinton campaign's press secretary Brian Fallon -- just a day before Kadzik's ""heads up."" Derespina continues:And it seems the Clinton camp already was well aware of the State Department FOIA case filing.On May 18, Fallon received a copy of the filing from someone inside the Justice Department and forwarded the document to Mills, Podesta and others. It's unknown who the original sender was because the person's name was stripped before Fallon forwarded the message. Lewis told FoxNews.com he also didn't know ""who Brian spoke to.""Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his supporters have accused the DoJ of failing the public's expectation of impartiality, starting with a secret meeting between former President Bill Clinton and Attorney General Lynch. Clinton and Lynch claimed to have spoken only about golf, grandchildren, and their travels on a private plane. However, only days after this meeting, FBI Director James Comey announced that the bureau would not pursue criminal charges against Clinton for violating federal laws on the handling of classified material.Trump reacted to the release of Kadzik's private email on Wednesday, telling a rally audience in Miami, Florida: ""The spread of political agendas into the Justice Department... is one of the saddest things that has happened to our country.""A Justice Department spokesman, though, downplayed the significance of Kadzik's 2015 email, saying it was ""about public information"" and sent ""in his personal capacity, not during work hours.""

""Remember, she lied 39 times. I don't recall. I don't recall. Well, those are all lies because she recalled every one of them. These are sad events for our country.

If she were to win, it would create unprecedented constitutional crisis.""""Here we go again with Clinton,"" Trump continued. ""You remember the impeachment and the problems. She is likely to be under investigation for many, many years. Also likely to conclude in a criminal trial. This is not what we need in this country folks. We need somebody that is going to go to work to bring our jobs back, to take care of our military, to strengthen up our borders. This is not what we need. It is going to be a mess and they say it. They say it. This is going to be a mess for many years to come before they figure it all out. We don't need that.""The GOP nominee, as he had in his previous stops in Florida, offered his list of policy proposals, one of which included his proposal to repeal Obamacare and reminded attendees of the looming rise in health care premiums due to the Obamacare legislation.Trump's visit to Jacksonville is his fourth of a four-stop swing through the Sunshine State in the waning moments of the presidential cycle. Yesterday, the GOP nominee made stops in Miami, Orlando and Pensacola. Polling shows Trump in a dead heat with Clinton in the contest for the state's 29 electoral votes.This is Trump's second appearance in Jacksonville in recent months. He made visit back in August to what is known as Florida's First Coast. Duval County, which is incorporated as all of Jacksonville, has gone traditionally voted Republican in presidential elections.

As The Daily Signal observes, Obama vetoed the NDAA last year mainly because he refused to increase defense spending if the budget for his non-military programs was not increased as well.This year, Obama is threatening to veto the NDAA over the Russell Amendment, a measure that simply restates what is currently law in the United States via the First Amendment.As analysts Roger Severino and Melanie Israel report at the Signal, Oklahoma Republican Rep. Steve Russell's amendment ""applies decades-old religious exemptions from Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (1964) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (1990) to federal grants and contracts.""For example, faith groups that run adoption facilities and hold a belief in traditional marriage have not been barred in the past from receiving federal grants and contracts. So, too, religious groups have a right to hire individuals who are committed to living out the beliefs of their faith. The fact that Obama is willing to veto the NDAA over a restatement of what has been an application of the First Amendment is yet another sign of his design to transform the country.The authors write:Obama's veto threat is actually the strongest proof of why the Russell Amendment is needed. It shows that the president wants absolute freedom to discriminate against religious social service providers that interact with the government--all because many religious organizations won't endorse the LGBT cause. Congress should say no to the president's blatant attack on religious diversity....Obama would interpret existing religious protections narrowly in order to make religious groups bend to the LGBT agenda. As seen in the administration's education and health care mandates on gender identity, in practice, this means requiring employee bathrooms and showers meant for women be opened to biological men who self-identify as female regardless of people's religious beliefs on the matter. The administration's proven lack of respect for religious freedom when it comes to sexual orientation and gender identity policies is more than enough reason to keep the Russell Amendment.Senate Democrats, led by Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, joined Obama in what they claim is an amendment that would permit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, reports Roll Call. The Democrats expressed concern such a provision could undermine Obama's prior executive order that prohibits groups with federal contracts from claiming their First Amendment rights.""The Russell Amendment is one of the most significant threats to LGBT people and women we have seen in Congress in years,"" said ACLU deputy legal director Louise Melling. ""It must be removed from the defense bill -- freedom, equality and fairness are at stake.""Dissident group ""Catholics for Choice"" tweeted its hostility toward the Russell Amendment:It's time to #RejectRussell. #Religiousfreedom does not mean freedom to discriminate with taxpayer funds.-- Catholics for Choice (@Catholic4Choice) October 25, 2016As did Planned Parenthood:We're joining the #RejectRussell chat to reject tax-payer funded discrimination -- join us! pic.twitter.com/Lu0ZxptwWq-- Planned Parenthood (@PPact) October 25, 2016Advocates for the First Amendment and religious freedom, however, say Obama is once again using Americans to advance his own political agenda.""The Obama administration and its left-wing allies are engaged in yet another attempt to undermine religious liberty in America, and this time they're using America's military as pawns,"" said Heritage Action vice president Dan Holler. ""The Russell Amendment simply reaffirms and reapplies longstanding federal protections of religious liberty.""Obama's veto threat is actually the strongest proof of why the Russell Amendment is needed. It shows that the president wants absolute freedom to discriminate against religious social service providers that interact with the government--all because many religious organizations won't endorse the LGBT cause.

And Trump emerged onstage in Colorado on Sunday holding a rainbow flag with the words ""LGBTs for Trump"" written on it.Though the crowd in Jacksonville was predominantly white -- and someone high in the stands even brought a Confederate flag -- the supporters were an eclectic mix.Rabbi Eli Wilansky, distinctive in his black suit and hat, walked through the crowd, looking for Jews who wanted to put on tefillin, the leather straps and boxes that are traditionally worn by Jewish men in morning prayers.He held a sign: ""#MakeTefillinGreatAgain.""He said he was not trying to make a political point, and that he would do the same at Hillary Clinton rallies, given the opportunity. As for the election, ""God controls the world,"" he told Breitbart News. ""God is going to make the final decision.""Andrea Colson of Jacksonville held a homemade ""Redheads for Trump"" sign. She said what inspired her to support Trump was his love for America.""He loves America. He is giving up so much for us, because he loves us. You can just feel the love in his voice when you hear him speak. He really loves this country.""Galina, a Russian-American immigrant, said she supported Trump's foreign policy. ""I like the idea of peace between Russia and the United States,"" she said.There were several families, including children, at the rally. Ashley Lagazo brought her daughter, Ahliana, to see Trump, whom she said was ""the best candidate addressing all the issues.""Kyle Helm, also of Jacksonville, said that he supported Trump because of his business experience.""Finally, we have someone who knows about money ... We need a leader who truly understands how to make change rather than printing and spending more money, and creating more problems.""Trump's major themes in the address included Obamacare, job creation and military spending. He touched on the latest news about the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server, noting that an indictment had been reported likely in the inquiry into the Clinton Foundation.And he expanded on his recent remarks criticizing Hillary Clinton for cheating during the presidential debates by accepting leaked questions from former CNN contributor, and current Democratic National Committee chair, Donna Brazile.He added that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) had been the main victim of the cheating, and wondered why Sanders had not yet given up on Hillary Clinton.""Doesn't he tell his supporters to go vote for trump at some point?"" he asked, to cheers.Trump was scheduled to make appearances in North Carolina later Thursday.This post has been updated to correct Donald Trump's schedule.Joel B.

President Obama and Michelle Obama will join her on stage as well as her husband Bill Clinton and her daughter Chelsea Clinton.This will be the first time that Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton have campaigned together since they were at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.The Obamas have been acting as surrogates for Clinton, as the president has campaigned tirelessly for her in the final week of the campaign. First Lady Michelle Obama joined Hillary Clinton for a rally in North Carolina.Throughout the campaign, Clinton has relied on more popular surrogates including Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vice President Joe Biden, and former Vice President Al Gore, to try to energize Democratic voters.Her final rally, therefore, will be less about change, and more about continuing the same policies sought by the Obama administration and the first Clinton administration.It also suggests that the campaign sees Pennsylvania as the most important state to keep Democratic, as they face more difficult odds against Donald Trump in Florida and North Carolina.Clinton will spend Election Day in New York City at Manhattan's Javits Center.SIGN UP	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]
