Located in the influential Midwestern region and known for holding the first primary in the nation, Iowa was long considered a Republican stronghold until the state went blue in both 2008 and 2012 for President Barack Obama.Chuck Grassley has also won reelection for a seventh term, saving his Senate seat from Democratic challenger and former lieutenant governor Patty Judge. Grassley was predicted to win despite heavy criticism from Democrats for his blockage of Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland.Grassley was an early Trump supporter.BREITBART LIVE	['Grassley', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

Jerry Brown, the California Democratic Party and a host of other elected officials and Democratic organizations.Sanchez attempted to pull votes from Republicans who'd been left without a candidate, a casualty of the state's jungle primary system that left the choice between two Democrats.

Ron Johnson Defeats Russ Feingold, Again	In a closely watched race in the swing state of Wisconsin, incumbent Sen. Ron Johnson wins re-election against the man he ousted six years ago.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERWith two-thirds of the vote in, Johnson had a solid lead.During a late surge, Johnson and his surrogates launched a last minute spending spree on campaign ads in the last weeks of the campaign as some polls showed former Sen. Russ Feingold's large lead dwindling to, in some cases a tie and in others only a small Feingold lead.Johnson, a businessman and first time politician when he first ran in 2010, was swept into office along with a wave of conservative-minded challengers that year. While he departed often from the Tea Party line during his tenure in Washington, he has certainly been more conservative than Feingold, whom he replaced as the Badger State's Senator.For his part, Feingold is a liberal lion of very long standing and held the seat Johnson now occupies from 1992 all the way to 2010 when Johnson shocked by toppling the then powerful Wisconsin Democrat. Holding the seat gives Republicans a good chance of retaining control of the Senate.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.SIGN UP	['Holding', 'Warner']	[]

Because the system is a universal, government-paid initiative, it would have ended Obamacare, a result that many have said is the ultimate goal of Barack Obama's signature health care law: to raise premiums so high and restrict choices so much that Americans would clamor for a fully government-paid health care system.As CNBC recently reported, ColoradoCare would have been funded with a 10 percent state income and payroll tax. Employers would have been required to pay two-thirds of the payroll tax, while their workers would have paid one-third. Colorado citizens who are unemployed or deemed below the poverty level would have been covered with full health insurance but would have remained exempt from the tax.Opponents of the amendment -- who have expressed concern about the long-term funding for the government insurance program -- have been Democrat Gov. John Hickenlooper and Progress Now.""We're grateful to the people of Colorado for carefully considering Amendment 69 and voting overwhelmingly against a measure that was clearly risky, untested, and fiscally irresponsible,"" said Kelly Brough, president and CEO of the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce and chair of Coloradans for Coloradans. ""We worked hard to build a coalition of groups across the political spectrum, and we came together to explain how ColoradoCare would have been devastating to working families, small business and Colorado's economy.""""An analysis by the Colorado Health Institute concluded that ColoradoCare would break even in its first year but would 'slide into ever-increasing deficits' longer-term without tax increases,"" reported CNBC.SIGN UP"	['Hickenlooper']	['creation']

Zawistowki largely took the lead of pro-Trump ground efforts in Ohio after the Trump campaign split with the state party. He worked closely with Women for Trump, which kept the ground game going, and the NRA, which kept the mailing game going.""Six to seven points is where we thought we were going to be,"" Zawistowski said, noting that Clinton was only around 51 percent in Cuyahoga County, which is usually a landslide Democrat area.

Jeff Sessions: Trump Results ‘A Powerful Expression by the American People’	"NEW YORK, New York -- Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), a key ally of, and adviser to, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, told reporters on the floor of the Trump victory party that Trump's strong performance on Election Night was ""a powerful expression by the American people.""SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAs Sessions spoke, the presidential election looked too close to call -- a surprising result, given than most analysts predicted Clinton to win easily.Sessions said: ""Every time they count him out, he's still standing.""He added:""Trump's prospects have improved, and he's running against the mainstream media and moneyed interests.""He's been outspent by a tremendous amount, but because he had the courage to stand up for fundamental principles ... like the trade laws, like immigration ... people stuck with him.""They didn't cut and run, and he didn't cut and run.""Sessions spoke as networks called a close race in Virginia for Hillary Clinton, and just before they called Ohio for Trump.Hillary Clinton also won Colorado and New Mexico, with results still coming in the key Upper Midwest states of Michigan and Pennsylvania, where both campaigns fought hard in the closing days of the campaign.Polls had also just closed in Iowa and Nevada, two swing states that were targeted by both campaigns. Trump was expected to win Iowa, but early voting numbers favored Clinton in Nevada.One of the reasons Sessions supported Trump from an early stage -- when few in Congress would -- was his positions on trade and immigration. Those positions are also the greatest reason for Trump's strong performance in Ohio and his competitive fight in other Rust Belt states.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Just like his father, Birch Bayh, Evan was a one-time U.S. senator from Indiana, but he is also a past Indiana governor.Despite that rich history, Bayh's well-known name was not enough to send him to victory in his attempt to once again go to Washington for Indiana.In a year where voters were looking for outsiders, Bayh was dogged by his work as a lobbyist and was stung when news broke that he did not even have a permanent home in his state.Instead, Indiana voters chose two-term Republican Congressman Todd Young, who made a name for himself by beating an incumbent Democrat congressman for his first run for Congress in 2010.Indiana easily went for Trump and became one of the earliest states to be called for a candidate on election night. The state is also the home state of the GOP vice presidential nominee, Governor Mike Pence.But tonight's results may bode ill for the 2018 re-election campaign of Joe Donnelly, Indiana's only Democrat U.S. senator.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.SIGN UP	['Pence', 'Trump', 'Warner']	[]

Marco Rubio won re-election to his seat in Florida, a race he entered late, only after his presidential campaign faltered.And Tammy Duckworth, the Democratic Illinois congresswoman, defeated incumbent GOP Sen. Mark Kirk in a race that was widely predicted would hand Democrats one of the seats they were looking for.The map for the Senate favored Democrats this year, with all but one of nine seats most likely to decide the balance being held by Republicans.The nine races where a seat is open or most likely to change hands were in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Illinois, Wisconsin, Missouri, Nevada, Florida and Indiana. Of that group, seven seats belong to Republican incumbents trying to hang on. Only two are open seats, Indiana and Nevada. The only one in Democratic hands presently is Nevada, where Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid is retiring.Coming into Tuesday, the House seemed a much safer bet for Republicans -- and the election night tallies proved true. The GOP held an enormous 59-seat advantage coming into Tuesday. The non-partisan Cook political report listed 18 seats as pure tossups, not enough to flip control of the chamber to Democrats, even if they ran the table in all of them.BREITBART LIVE	['Cook', 'Kirk', 'Paul', 'Reid', 'Rubio']	[]

Patrick Murphy (D-FL) on Tuesday with the race being called for the incumbent shortly after the polls closed.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAlthough who won Florida's 29 electoral votes in the state's presidential contest was still in question when the race was called, there was little doubt for Rubio.The discourse between the two candidates was heated at times during the campaign, but Rubio was shown to be consistently ahead in the polls over Murphy immediately after announcing his candidacy for U.S. Senate, which came days after he bowed out of the presidential race.In his victory speech in Miami, Rubio congratulated Murphy over a ""good race.""""Let me start by saying this is a lot better than the last time I did one of these in Miami,"" Rubio said to open his address. ""Let me begin by telling you a few moments ago, I got off the phone with Congressman Murphy and I congratulated him on a good race. Congressman Murphy is a young man with a bright future and i thanked him for his willingness to step forward in public service. Running for office is hard. Putting your name forward is hard. I want to begin by acknowledging what I always do. Absolutely, you should clap for Patrick. He ran a great race.""A portion of Rubio's victory speech was also given in Spanish. During that portion, Rubio thanked Puerto Ricans, Venezuelans, Colombians and ""obviously the Cubans"" for their support.Rubio went on to acknowledge there are disagreements given the diversity of the country, but argued disgreement should not result in hate. He went on to add how he sees the state of the country and the Sunshine State and what the role of the government is for both to ""move forward.""""[I] hope that I and my colleagues as we return to work in Washington D.C. can set a better example how political discourse should exist in this country,"" Rubio said. ""And I know people feel betrayed and you have a right to. Every major institution in our society has failed us -- the media, the government, big business, Wall Street, academia -- they have all failed us. So people are so frustrated and angry. But we must channel that anger and frustration into something positive. Let it move us forward as energy to confront and solve our challenges and our problems. America has never had an easy era. Florida has never had an easy era. Our state has always confronted great long and so too has our people. And yet in each generation Americans have stepped forward to confront their challenges and embrace their opportunities. And now the time has come for us to do the same.""""I believe with all my heart if we do what needs to be done in the years to come that my children and yours will be the freest and most prosperous Americans who have ever lived,"" he continued. ""But we must start now. For while we have time to get this right, we do not have forever. I will close by saying I have belief that the decisions we make in government are important. I know in the end America will not be saved by politicians. I hope that we as a nation will return to our roots as a people and as a nation, respecting our diversity but understanding that ultimately what unites us people iscommon dream and common hope of a better life. And that we can only achieve that if we all achieve that and I hope God gives me the opportunity and voice to move forward.""At the end, he urged Americans to say a prayer for the country, ""irrespective""of the outcome of the presidential race.Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poorSIGN UP"	['Rubio']	['god']

While Republicans lead in ballots requested with 36.5 percent of the total, Republicans also lead in ballots returned with 40 percent of the total.ColoradoIn Colorado, Republicans have continued to build on daily leads in ballots returned, and now have an advantage in total ballots cast, 775,000 to 756,000, the RNC reports. In the following swing counties, Republicans are currently outperforming their share of registered voters in that county: Arapahoe - Republicans make up 29 percent of all registered voters and 34 percent of all votes cast to date. Jefferson - Republicans make up 30 percent of all registered voters and 33.5 percent of all votes cast to date; Larimer - Republicans make up 31 percent of all registered voters and 35 percent of all votes cast to date.This is very promising to see, as Republicans are also outperforming their share of registered voters in traditionally strong Republican counties, the RNC said.In Douglas County, Republicans have returned 49 percent of 151,000 ballots cast and in El Paso County, Republicans have also returned 47 percent of 248,000 ballots cast.GeorgiaFor much of the summer and early fall, the media was reporting that Georgia was in play for the Democrats and their presidential nominee Hillary R. Clinton.The RNC reports that although Georgia does not have partisan registration, there are numerous strong indicators in the early voting trends so far.Republicans said that when examining the Atlanta suburbs of Cobb County and Gwinnett County, which Romney won 55-43 percent and 54-45 percent respectively, turnout appears way up compared to this point in 2012.In Cobb County, there has been a 34 percent increase in absentee and early vote turnout to date, which has amounted to over 40,000 more total ballots cast to-date, and in Gwinnett County, there has been a 55 percent increase in turnout to date, which has amounted to over 59,000 more total ballots cast to date, the GOP said.FloridaThere is no state more tightly contested than Florida. The Republicans report that they trail by 78,000 fewer ballots cast than on Election Day in 2012, which completely erases the margin Romney lost Florida by in 2012. This is a very promising sign into tonight in one of the most important races in the country. In the 2012 election, President Barack Obama beat his GOP rival W. Mitt Romney by less than one percent.IowaThe RNC reports that in Iowa, Republicans today continue to make up 2.5 percent more of the total share of ballots cast, having closed the deficit in ballots cast by over 22,000 compared to this day in 2012. They also contend that there is a clear difference in enthusiasm between the two parties here in Iowa. While Republicans have cast 14,000 more ballots to-date than in 2012, Democrats have cast 7,000 fewer ballots to-date.MichiganThe Republican nominee for president Donald J. Trump put Michigan in play in the last two weeks of the campaign, and just after midnight Trump held his last rally of the campaign in Grand Rapids.Republicans report that voter turnout is up throughout Michigan, although it would appear to have spiked especially high in Republican-leaning regions of the state. In Kent County, the largest county to support Romney in 2012, there has been an increase in ballots returned by over 56 percent compared to 2012, which amounts to an additional 26,000 ballots cast. In Livingston County and Ottawa County, which Romney carried by 61 percent to 38 percent and 67 percent to 32 percent, respectively, each have increased the amount of ballots returned by 36 percent compared to 2012.NevadaThe Republican National Committee said its field operatives have outperformed 2012's final Early Voting/Absentee Voting vote total by over 16,000 ballots cast. This has led Republicans to closing the Early Voting/Absentee Voting margin compared to 2012 by over 2,000 ballots cast.North CarolinaThe GOP reported that as of Election Day, Republicans trail by over 140,000 fewer ballots cast than in 2012. Romney ultimately prevailed in NC despite facing a much larger absentee and early vote deficit going into Election Day.As a whole for absentee and early voting, Republicans have cast over 115,000 more ballots than we did in 2012, while Democrats have cast over 20,000 fewer ballots through today than they had in 2012, they said. Democrats have dropped in the total vote share six percent compared to 2012, while Republicans have increased their early vote share by 0.5 percent.OhioThe RNC reported that they continue to see a significant drop-off in turnout from the counties that supported President Obama four years ago.Cuyahoga County has had over 52,000 fewer ballots cast than they had in 2012, which is a 20 percent drop off of voter turnout. Franklin County has had over 18,000 fewer ballots cast than they had in 2012, which is an eight percent drop off of voter turnout. Hamilton County has had over 13,000 fewer ballots cast, which is a 12 percent drop off of voter turnout, and Summit County has over 5,000 fewer ballots cast, which is a six percent drop off of voter turnout.Another positive sign for the Republicans, they said, is key counties that supported Romney, where there is stronger support than in 2012 absentee and early voting:Warren County has already cast over 6,500 more ballots than in 2012, an 18 percent increase in voter turnout. Delaware County has already cast 1,500 more ballots, a four percent increase in voter turnout. Greene County has already cast 2,500 more ballots, a 10 percent voter increase, and Miami County has also cast over 2,500 more ballots, a 15 percent voter increase.SIGN UP	['Clinton', 'Romney', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

She has no idea if her vote was counted and was very upset by the process.There are 18 different polling sites that have had similar problems taking place, Kelly said. The state party is looking into the discrepancies.If votes are only being flipped one way, ""it's a computer fix, not a computer glitch,"" Kelly said.Concerned voters can call the GOP hotline: 1-877-91-PAGOP, Kelly said.Calling the hotline if anything worrying occurs is key, Kelly said, and so is reviewing the vote you cast: Voters ""have to look at the [ballot] summary to make sure it's exactly the way you voted.""""We're hearing these things are changing, and it's all one way,"" Kelly said. ""You can say, well, maybe it was a computer glitch, but it's all people voting for Trump. And it's defaulting to Clinton.""BREITBART LIVE"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

Trump's policies are appealing to blacks. There are even some polls out there, like a survey USA poll, saying Trump is actually doing fine with Latinos.""In the Nevada primary on Tuesday, Trump not only won the Hispanic vote; he not only won 17 points more of the Hispanic vote than his next closest rival; but his Latino vote nearly matched that of the two Latino candidates combined.In one of the few times you might have heard this point expressed on television airwaves, Marlow said that the No. 1 issue for Breitbart News' 20 million readers, ""has consistently been -- since last year -- immigration. They are looking for someone who is going to seal the border and prioritize border security as No. 1.""Obviously, Marlow was right about everything. According to Nexis, that was the last time he appeared on TV.It would be as if, after discovering America, Christopher Columbus reported back to the King and Queen of Spain, but the booker for Ferdinand and Isabella decided that, instead of Columbus, she'd get the guy who never actually set sail for the New World because he was afraid he'd fall off the edge of the Earth into a fiery pit.11:32: Game, Set, Match?

About a quarter of voters surveyed said the debates were the most important factor in their decision in a country in which 69% of voters said they were either ""angry"" or ""dissatisfied"" with the federal government. The electorate was tailor-made for Trump's anti-establishment message on trade, anti-cronyism, and immigration. But Trump never effectively made that case when he had the most number of eyeballs on him during the debates, which generated Super Bowl-sized audiences. If Trump loses tonight, it may well be because he didn't prepare for the debates and left so many points on the field in light of the mood of the electorate, according to the Reuters/Ipsos online exit poll that found (say what you want about Trump supporter Bill Belichick,  but he would have never ever let one of his players be as unprepared as Trump, who seemed like a player who did not even take the time to read his team's playbook, was during his three debates):- 75 percent agree that ""America needs a strong leader to take the country back from the rich and powerful.""
- 72 percent agree ""the American economy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful.""
- 68 percent agree that ""traditional parties and politicians don't care about people like me.""
- 76 percent believe ""the mainstream media is more interested in making money than telling the truth.""
- 57 percent feel that ""more and more, I don't identify with what America has become.""
- 54 percent feel ""it is increasingly hard for someone like me to get ahead in America.""5:35: Get ready for the usual suspects to push more amnesty:Exit poll has now-standard silly ""legalize or deport"" immig. question, according to voter who took it.

-- Asma Khalid (@asmamk) November 9, 2016""The media has lied about the race and Breitbart repeatedly"" @AlexMarlow
-- Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) November 9, 2016Alex Marlow, editor in chief of Breitbart News, explained everything that was about to happen in this race back on the Sept. 14 edition of CNN's Erin Burnett show.
While all the other ""strategists"" gibbered about Trump losing the Hispanic vote, Marlow said: ""Trump is growing the big tent. ... Trump's policies are appealing to blacks. There are even some polls out there, like a survey USA poll, saying Trump is actually doing fine with Latinos.""
In the Nevada primary on Tuesday, Trump not only won the Hispanic vote; he not only won 17 points more of the Hispanic vote than his next closest rival; but his Latino vote nearly matched that of the two Latino candidates combined.
In one of the few times you might have heard this point expressed on television airwaves, Marlow said that the No. 1 issue for Breitbart News' 20 million readers, ""has consistently been -- since last year -- immigration. They are looking for someone who is going to seal the border and prioritize border security as No. 1.""
Obviously, Marlow was right about everything. According to Nexis, that was the last time he appeared on TV.

His initials are commonly used in the published emails.Latham's email further contains a draft message to Foxx from Podesta, written entirely in lowercase letters. The email makes clear the materials being sent to Foxx were campaign related:Secretary Foxx,really great to catch up earlier today, thanks again for your time next week. our Iowa team is ready to welcome you - pack some extra layers! as discussed I wanted to share our latest talking points on what's at stake in this election, our policy paper on our infrastructure plan, and thought you may find it helpful to read Tom Perez's speech from his trip to Iowa with Sec Clinton.don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or need anything further.best,JohnFisher replied, ""Sure!""On January 11, five days after the email referencing the campaign's Iowa team was sent, Foxx officially endorsed Clinton at a campaign event in Iowa.  He became the fourth Obama Cabinet member to back Clinton's presidential bid.The emails from both Latham and Fisher were sent from their domains at Clinton's campaign, @hillaryclinton.com. Podesta's gmail account was copied in the exchanges.No explanation was provided for why the campaign staffer was asked to bypass Foxx's government address.

Local Republicans have taken to social media @PhillyGOP to share their accounts with the nation in real-time.A small sampling of these tweets (with ""minority inspector"" referring to Republican inspectors) just from the morning hours of Election Day include:Most of these tweets were tagged with #VoterFraud.Political analysts sometimes say that Pennsylvania is ""Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Alabama,"" meaning that there are two Democratic strongholds in the Keystone State, surrounded by vast expanses of deep-red support for limited government, faith, marriage, and the Second Amendment.Philadelphia is nothing short of notorious for voter fraud. One of the most infamous examples of voting-law violations in modern history was when The Justice Department secured a court judgment against the Black Panthers for a videotaped incident of voter intimidation, a case that after the government won but before enforcement could take place, Barack Obama's then-new Attorney General Eric Holder to drop the case and let the Black Panthers go.Some polls are split regarding whether Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton is likely to win Pennsylvania, with Republicans complaining that voter fraud is so rampant in Philadelphia that it could steal a victory from Donald Trump if the margin is close.Trump has been pounding away on the theme that aspects of the system are ""rigged"" urging his supporters to turn out in massive numbers to ensure victory when the polls close.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.
