Either one of these candidates could realistically run the table in these seven states. The big question is if Donald Trump can mobilize his voters and get them to the polls, if he can't then he will lose,"" stated the Director of Remington Research Group Titus Bond.In North Carolina, 2,596 likely voters were surveyed November 1 and November 2, where Trump was the top pick. According to the results, he leads Clinton by three points, 48 percent to 45 percent -- just outside the 1.92 percent margin of error.Trump only leads by one point in Nevada, within the 2.31 percent margin of error. The Nevada survey questioned 1,793 likely voters on November 1st and 2nd.The Republican nominee is up three points over Clinton in Florida, just outside the 2.02 percent margin of error, in a survey questioning 2,352 likely voters from November 1 and November 2.He only leads Clinton by one point in Ohio where 2,557 likely voters were surveyed November 1 and November 2.

Trump's final stop of the night was scheduled to be Virginia, completing five rallies in one day, and travel to seven states.The rally began two hours late, but supporters waited patiently to see Trump -- including several small children, who were dressed in Trump-themed superhero costumes or wrapped in Trump flags.Trump arrived in dramatic fashion on his plane, which taxied in front of the hangar, whose doors then opened. He came down the jetway and immediately waved a Terrible Towel, a favorite symbol of the Pittsburgh Steelers.Trump promised to bring steel jobs back to Pennsylvania, and promised to defend the shale oil industry from Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.Retiree Ron Wright and his wife, Nancy, came to the rally from Pittsburgh. ""I can't stand the Clintons,"" Mr. Wright told Breitbart News. ""This guy's got flaws, but if he campaigned for the last eight or nine months, he'd be far ahead today.""Mary Lou Durham of Houston, Texas was in town as part of a group of 20 called the Mighty American Strike Force, which deploys from the Lone Star State to canvas voters in swing states during presidential elections. She said that she had been met with a very warm response from Pennsylvania voters, who are concerned about taxes and their effects on jobs, as well as the costs of Obamacare.Pennsylvania has 20 Electoral College votes. It has not cast them for a Republican presidential candidate since 1998, when George H. W. Bush won in a landslide. However, Republicans have looked to the Keystone State as a possible pickup for several successive elections.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

""I would rather have Trump be president for four years and build a real left-wing movement that can get us what we deserve as a people, than to let Hillary be president and we stay locked in the same space where we don't get what we want.""I'm not scared of Trump. I'm scared of us as a country moving in the wrong direction... I have very l little trust in what Democratic party is doing. And I worry we're investing so much faith in them out of fear... They're essentially saying, ""If you don't vote for us, then you're going to have Donald Trump and your life will be ruined."" If you frame that as the choice, you never get to demand what you actually deserve and what you actually want.Hill explained that the Democratic Party, now relying on a campaign of fear to pressure progressives to vote Clinton, is the same Democratic party that launched ""a campaign of dirty tricks, lies, misrepresentations and outright just egregious acts of unethical behavior"" in order to ""pus[h] Bernie [Sanders] out and marginaliz[e]"" Sanders's progressive message.On Saturday, rapper and vocal Sanders supporter, Killer Mike, took to Instagram to tell black voters to ""stay the f*ck home"" if politicians on the ballot do not represent their views on certain political issues.""Black Voters in states like Georgia this is your chance to MAKE A DEMAND and have it met! Don't remain a pasty [sic] and pet simply doing what u are told. Get something for your vote or stop complaining and accept your role as a 2cd Class citizen once and for all,"" Killer Mike wrote.""If you're voting for Trump or Hillary Clinton, you're voting for the same thing,"" Killer Mike told TMZ in August after Sanders had lost the Democratic primary. While Killer Mike did not indicate who he was voting for at that time, he explained that, ""We had one candidate this year -- who had a strong chance of winning -- who was anti-growing war, and that was Sanders, and we didn't vote him in, so we're getting what we asked for... We're asking for more war. And if you don't want any war, you'd be voting Jill Stein.""Are we supposed to be impressed when one criminal who lied to bring us to war in Iraq endorses another? #NoMoreWar https://t.co/BlqsELPJxe-- Dr. Jill Stein (@DrJillStein) October 27, 2016At a Saturday campaign rally for Clinton, the president of Iowa State University's chapter of Students for Bernie, Kaleb Vanfosson, took to the stage and excoriated Clinton, telling rally attendees not to vote for her as the liberal crowd cheered him on.""The only thing she cares about is pleasing her donors, the billionaires who fund her campaign,"" Vanfosson declared. ""The only people that really trust Hillary are Goldman Sachs, CitiGroup can trust Hillary, the military industrial complex can trust Hillary. Her good friend Henry Kissinger can trust Hillary.""""She is so trapped in the world of the elite that she has completely lost grip on what it's like to be an average person,"" Vanfosson continued. ""She doesn't care. Voting for another lesser of two evils, there's no point.""Earlier this week, Dave Chappelle blasted Clinton's integrity during a set at The Cutting Room in New York City.""On Friday night, he shocked the crowd with a 60-minute set largely devoted to slamming Hillary Clinton,"" the Observer reported in a piece titled, ""Dave Chappelle Defends Trump, Rips Clinton, 'She's Not Right and We All Know It.'"" Chappelle said he ""didn't feel good"" about voting for Clinton. ""She's going to be on a coin someday. And her behavior has not been coin-worthy,"" Chappelle reportedly said.On Tuesday, Jill Stein won the endorsement of actress and former Sanders supporter Susan Sarandon.""Fear of Donald Trump is not enough for me to support Clinton, with her record of corruption,"" Sarandon wrote in a letter announcing her decision to endorse of Stein. ""Now that Trump is self-destructing, I feel even those in swing states have the opportunity to vote their conscience.""Sarandon listed nearly a dozen reasons why she could not support Clinton, including the fact that Clinton ""supports TPP"" and ""takes lobbyists money for campaigning.""Sarandon has denounced Clinton repeatedly throughout the campaign and has said that she believes a President Clinton's hawkishness and ""moral judgement"" is ""more dangerous"" than a President Trump.""I'm more afraid of actually Hillary Clinton's war record and her hawkishness than I am of building a wall,"" Sarandon said back in April.""She did not learn a thing from Iraq. She is an interventionist. She's done horrible things, horrible things, and very callously,"" Sarandon said in June. ""I don't know if she's overcompensating or what her trip is. I think we'll be in Iran in two seconds. That scares me. That frightens me... [I] know what her policies are... [I] know where she's taking money from.""Saudi Arabia:-top Clinton Foundation donor-lobbies US via Podesta group-got record arms deals from Obama/Clinton-top terrorism sponsor-- Dr. Jill Stein (@DrJillStein) November 4, 2016Back in June, Sarandon warned that a Clinton indictment was ""inevitable."" As The Hill reported:Sarandon predicted in a separate interview that Clinton will ultimately face indictment for her use of a private email server while secretary of State.""Nobody's even talking about this indictment,"" she told MSNBC. ""What happens with that, besides the trust issue of catching her in so many lies?""""Well, there has been no indictment,"" Chris Jansing responded.""No, but there's going to be,"" responded Sarandon. ""I mean, it's inevitable.""""The woman is a disaster!"" dissident feminist Camille Paglia told The Spectator last month. ""It's an outrage how she's played the gender card. She is a woman without accomplishment. 'I sponsored or co-sponsored 400 bills.' Oh really? These were bills to rename bridges and so forth. And the things she has accomplished have been like the destabilisation of North Africa, causing refugees to flood into Italy.""Michael Moore, a former Sanders supporter who now is actively campaigning for and supporting Hillary Clinton, has explained that the lack of enthusiasm for Clinton is, in part, a result of Trump's populist message that speaks to ""people who are hurting,"" combined with Clinton's longstanding record of championing policies that have ""royally screwed"" people in middle America who are hurting.In a July post titled, ""5 Reasons Why Trump Will Win,"" Moore wrote, ""Let's face it: Our biggest problem here isn't Trump - it's Hillary. She is hugely unpopular -- nearly 70% of all voters think she is untrustworthy and dishonest.""""Her vote for the Iraq War made me promise her that I would never vote for her again,"" Moore wrote, noting that even though he's now breaking that promise so that he can to vote against Trump, ""I sadly believe Clinton will find a way to get us in some kind of military action. She's a hawk, to the right of Obama,"" Moore said.""She represents the old way of politics, not really believing in anything other than what can get you elected,"" Moore added. ""That's why she fights against gays getting married one moment, and the next she's officiating a gay marriage... No Democrat, and certainly no independent, is waking up on November 8th excited to run out and vote for Hillary the way they did the day Obama became president or when Bernie was on the primary ballot. The enthusiasm just isn't there.""Moore explained that, by contrast:[Trump has] said (correctly) that the Clintons' support of NAFTA helped to destroy the industrial states of the Upper Midwest. Trump is going to hammer Clinton on this and her support of TPP and other trade policies that have royally screwed the people of these four states. When Trump stood in the shadow of a Ford Motor factory during the Michigan primary, he threatened the corporation that if they did indeed go ahead with their planned closure of that factory and move it to Mexico, he would slap a 35% tariff on any Mexican-built cars shipped back to the United States. It was sweet, sweet music to the ears of the working class of Michigan, and when he tossed in his threat to Apple that he would force them to stop making their iPhones in China and build them here in America, well, hearts swooned... From Green Bay to Pittsburgh, this, my friends, is the middle of England - broken, depressed, struggling, the smokestacks strewn across the countryside with the carcass of what we use to call the Middle Class. Angry, embittered working (and nonworking) people who were lied to by the trickle-down of Reagan and abandoned by Democrats who still try to talk a good line but are really just looking forward to rub one out with a lobbyist from Goldman Sachs who'll write them nice big check before leaving the room. What happened in the UK with Brexit is going to happen here.Slavoj Zizek, a Lacanian Marxist philosopher and superstar professor amongst collegiate millennials, said earlier this week that, if he were American, he would vote for Trump over Clinton.""I'm horrified at him,"" Zizek said, ""[but] I'm just left thinking Hillary is the true danger. Why? She built an impossible, all-inclusive coalition. Look, the one point when I fully agreed with Trump was, you remember, when Bernie Sanders endorsed Hillary? ... Trump said it's like somebody from Occupy Wall Street endorsing Lehman Brothers.""""I'm just afraid that Hillary stands for this absolute inertia, the most dangerous one, because she's a cold warrior, and so on, connected with banks pretending to be socially progressive,"" Zizek added. ""In every society, there is a whole network of unwritten rules, how politics works, and how you build consensus. And Trump disturbed this. If Trump wins, both major parties-Republicans and Democrats-would have to return to basics, rethink themselves, and maybe some things can happen there ... It will be a kind of big awakening. New political processes will be set in motion, will be triggered.""In July, Dr. Cornel West, a prominent and provocative democratic intellectual, endorsed Stein over Clinton, explaining Stein is ""the only progressive woman in the race.""""The Clinton train-- [of] Wall Street, security surveillance, militaristic-- is not going in the same direction I'm going,"" West told Bill Maher earlier this year.She's a neoliberal... [I] believe neoliberalism is a disaster when it comes to poor people and when it comes to people in other parts of the world dealing with U.S. foreign policy and militarism. Oh, absolutely. Ask the people in Libya about that. Ask the people in the West Bank about that.West has separately explained that Clinton's ""militarism makes the world a less safe place"" and that her globalist agenda created the ""right-wing populism"" that has fueled Trump's rise.Clinton policies of the 1990s generated inequality, mass incarceration, privatization of schools and Wall Street domination. There is also a sense that the Clinton policies helped produce the right-wing populism that we're seeing now in the country. And we think she's going to come to the rescue? That's not going to happen.""It's too easy to view him [Trump] as an isolated individual and bash him,"" West told Maher. ""He's speaking to the pain in the country because white, working class brothers have been overlooked by globalization, by these trade deals,"" trade deals which Stein also opposes.More Clinton-style trickle-down won't stop right-wing extremism.

They were also upset by -- what Stein has described -- the revelation of the Clinton camp's ""collusion"" with corporate media and the DNC's efforts to ""sabotage"" Sanders's campaign against Clinton.They've similarly been outraged by the discovery of Clinton's private beliefs relayed to Wall Street executives in paid speeches delivered behind-closed-doors -- including Clinton's belief that politicians need to have ""both a public and a private position"" on every issue.Are you still against the TPP, @HillaryClinton?

[...] among progressive operatives, goodwill for Clinton -- and confidence in key advisers featured in the emails including John Podesta, Neera Tanden and Jake Sullivan -- is eroding...Parting with Clinton, some prominent progressives have explained that they want a candidate and a vision they can vote ""for"" rather than just something to vote ""against.""""I don't want to vote against Donald Trump. I want to vote for workers' rights. I want to vote for living wage, for clean energy, for a world without mass incarceration. I want to vote for those things,"" Marc Lamont Hill said Sunday. ""That's what Green is about for me. It's about being able to vote for something, not just against something.""Hill explained that buying into the argument that voters need to choose the lesser of two evils means that voters are still forced to vote for evil.""Let's not choose evil,"" Hill said, explaining his support for Stein.On Sunday, Stein made her closing argument to the American voters and laid out what is at stake this election for the country and for the American people.""This election we are not only deciding what kind of world we will have, but whether we will have a world or not going forward,"" Stein said:Not only in regards to climate, not only in regards to these expanding wars where Hillary has this proven track record... of the most pro-conflict military policy as possible and she's calling for a no-fly zone in Syria which means we're essentially declaring war on Russia if Hillary gets elected. Declaring war on Russia at a time when we have 2,000 nuclear weapons between us and the Russians on hair trigger alert. This is a mushroom cloud waiting to happen. So it's really important right now for us to stand up and start building a force to do the right thing.""It's very clear what kind of a trend we're on,"" Stein explained:This is a race to the bottom between the greater and lesser evil. Where is the exit strategy if you buy into this [idea that one must vote for one of the major parties]? It means that in every election we have two candidates that are more corporatist, more militarist, more imperialist, more economic elites, more serving Wall Street, offshoring our jobs, more of these rigged corporate trade agreements, more of this climate policy... there is no exit strategy if you buy into the lesser evil. It means with each race we come closer and closer to the cliff.""""No one should fool themselves into thinking that the dangers will be smaller, that they will be mitigated in any way for having Hillary in White House, in some ways they're arguably even more immediate and intense,"" Stein added. ""But the dangers will be mitigated if we have created a strong force and we stand up loud and clear and we have a political base for this social movement that is coming together across this country and really across the world.

He also criticized the Syrian refugee program, and Obama's foreign policy in Syria, where he had announced his intention to attack Islamic State-held Mosul long before doing do.(U.S.-backed forces attacked the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa this weekend, but without similar fanfare, perhaps in reaction to such criticism.)As he has done at previous rallies, Trump attacked the media, who were booed by the crowd. The audience also burst spontaneously into a chant of ""CNN sucks!""Trump also drew cheers and jeers by mocking Jay-Z and his wife Beyonce, who performed for Hillary Clinton late last week. He said that he did not need celebrities, or guitars, to draw a crowd.That created a moment of awkwardness, since Trump had preceded onstage an hour before by musician Ted Nugent -- whose speech and performance Trump missed as his motorcade rushed from the airport to the venue.

Nugent praised his fellow ""Michiganiacs"" who had showed up to pack the rally.He told the audience to go home after the event and ""fix"" anyone who needed to be ""fixed"" to vote for Trump.Michigan has 16 Electoral College votes, which it has not cast for a Republican presidential candidate since 1988. However, Trump's threat to Clinton there is real.

The injunction was left standing by the U.S. Supreme Court in June.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe plaintiff illegal alien in the California lawsuit, Rocio Sanchez Ponce, contends that the legal block does not apply to her because a nationwide injunction against amnesty is improper and unlawful. She and two other plaintiffs from other ""pro-amnesty"" areas, New York and Illinois, are trying to have the nationwide injunction confined to only the 26 states that brought suit against President Obama.The states joined Texas in suing the federal government for dictating that the DAPA program (Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents) be implemented. The November 2014 executive order also expanded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (""DACA+""). Obama used federal government action to create DAPA in his post-midterms executive action announcement and unilaterally expanded his previous 2012 DACA program by extending amnesty and work-permit benefits from two to three years. This was despite the President publicly admitting many times that he lacked the authority to create such programs without congressional authorization.The executive amnesty litigation by the 26 states involved the legal questions of the proper scope of presidential power to bypass Congress and separation of powers, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) passed by Congress, and violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and other federal laws. The APA requires a time period for notice to and comment from the public before issuing rules that create public policy mirroring law. The INA was passed by Congress and it provides who can be immigrants, and who can become U.S. citizens.The court-ordered injunction against the DAPA program is not being challenged in the California case filed this past week. The federal lawsuit seeking DACA benefits, has been attached below.As of November 2015, approximately 1.2 million persons qualified for DACA, and approximately 636,000 applications were approved through 2014.If the federal government were to narrow the existing injunction to only those states that challenged Obama's amnesty order, either by judicial order or by a ""settlement"" with the illegal alien plaintiff, it appears there would be little that could prevent illegal aliens from one of the 26 states that brought the original lawsuit, including Texas, from going to another state to apply for and receive DACA+ benefits, say immigration reform activists and lawyers.U.S. district court Judge Andrew Hanen in the Southern District of Texas, issued the order blocking the unilateral federal action in February of 2015, as reported by Breitbart Texas. On appeal from that order, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed in November 2015. A tie at the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2016, left in place the injunction of Judge Hanen after the Fifth Circuit affirmed the lower court ruling, as reported by Breitbart Texas. Breitbart Texas reported in early October that the United States Supreme Court denied President Obama's request to rehear the executive amnesty case. The federal district court injunction therefore stands.The lawsuit filed on November 3 in California, is a ""copy-cat"" lawsuit by the firm. The first lawsuit was filed in New York on August 25, and the second was filed on October 12 in Chicago.The latest lawsuit has also been filed by the National Immigration Law Center (NILC). The Center states on its website that it ""is one of the leading organizations in the U.S. exclusively dedicated to defending and advancing the rights of low-income immigrants."" The Center is funded in part by George Soros' Open Society Foundations as well as the Ford Foundation and the Carnegie Endowment.Like NILC's other suits, this one alleges DHS violated the rights of their illegal alien client when it revoked her work permit under DACA+ which had been given to her before the injunction came down. The plaintiff, who still has her renewable two-year permit, described the decision to take away her DACA+ permit as ""not right."" As NILC contends, the revocation ""was done without observance of procedure required by law, as it violates binding DHS regulations that permit revocation only when a condition upon which employment authorization was granted has not been met or ceases to exist; upon a showing that the information in the application is not true and correct; or for 'good cause shown.'"" None of which were present here, they state.Further, NILC states that DHS further erred in revoking the work permit as it was based on ""an overly broad preliminary injunction entered by a court in Texas that lacked jurisdiction to reach California residents.""The Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI), which filed multiple friend of the court briefs in support of the 26 states challenging amnesty, says NILC's claims are beyond baseless.As the executive director and general counsel for IRLI, Dale Wilcox, told Breitbart Texas, ""This is the third copy-cat lawsuit in almost as many months brought by the same Soros-funded law firm. They're arguing that nationwide injunctions are 'unprecedented' which is not only absolutely false but completely absurd as nothing would stop an illegal alien in Texas from travelling to California to apply for DAPA-benefits. The injunction has to be nationwide.""Wilcox added, ""To confine to certain states Judge Hanen's injunction order, which SCOTUS has affirmed, would be absolutely hypocritical on the part of the Obama Administration. No administration has been more shrill about immigration law being strictly federal and no administration has attacked individual states so viciously when they try to 'go their own way' and attempt to enforce the laws which the feds refuse to.""As reported by Breitbart News in August, the plaintiff in the New York litigation, Batalla Vidal, was a DACA recipient who received a three-year work permit under the expanded DACA. He received the benefit before the official implementation date. Vidal came to the U.S. from Mexico at the age of seven and says he has lived in New York for approximately 20 years. When the Texas district court judge issued the preliminary injunction in February 2015, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services revoked his three-year permit and replaced it with a two-year work permit in May 2015. Vidal's lawsuit seeks a court declaration that the injunction does not apply to New York residents, he asks the court to declare the revocation ""unlawful""and to vacate and set it aside, and to reinstate his three-year employment authorization, as well as block the defendants in this case from revoking his employment authorization on the basis of the injunction in Texas v. United States.The lawsuit filed in Illinois on October 12th, Jose Lopez v. Richardson, et al., also challenges the ""unlawful revocation of employment authorization."" Lopez says he has lived in Chicago for ""virtually his entire life."" He, like the other plaintiffs, complains that the revocation was done on the basis of the injunction in the Texas-led case. Similarly, he argues that ""the district court lacked jurisdiction or remedial authority to enter, a preliminary injunction reaching Illinois."" Lopez says he was not a party to the Texas lawsuit and did not have a ""full and fair opportunity to defend his interests in that action."" He urges that the revocation of his employment authorization violated his rights under the Administrative Procedure Act. Lopez came to the U.S. from Mexico at the age of four.Lana Shadwick is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas. She has served as a prosecutor and associate judge in Texas.

In 1998, the state of Oregon became the first U.S. state to use a mail-in ballot system as the primary mechanism for voting, so the GOP worried that many voters may miss their chance to vote if their ballot never made it to them in the mail.The state GOP's robocall said in part: ""A review of voter registration records in [your county] indicate that your voter registration may be marked inactive. This could be the result of a change in address recently or the Motor Voter law that was enacted this year. This means you may not have received your ballot in the mail for next Tuesday's election.""The robocall did not, however, tell voters that their votes did not count, only that their names were marked as inactive and that if they didn't receive a ballot in the mail they should make sure to get one before Tuesday's Election Day deadline.The state's Democrat Secretary of State, though, seized on the ""controversy"" to attack the GOP and call their robocall a false flag effort to suppress the vote.When a few voters began to call her office to ask about the robocalls, Secretary of State Jeanne P. Atkins, a Democrat, used the incident to launch a partisan attack on the GOP claiming the robocalls were a ""type of voter suppression activity"" and called for the Oregon Department of Justice and U.S. Attorney's Office to investigate the calls.The media jumped right in to help Democrat Atkins turn the GOP voter outreach effort into a criminal act by misleading readers about the story.The Associated Press, for instance, published a story saying the state GOP ""admitted"" to making false statements.For the AP, Gillian Flaccus wrote: ""Oregon Secretary of State Jeanne P. Atkins said Saturday the state's GOP has acknowledged making automated calls that falsely told voters their ballots won't count.""This is untrue. The state GOP made no such admission. The party did admit to the calls, but did not admit that the calls were false.In fact, according to KOIN channel 6, the Oregon Department of Justice said the calls were entirely legitimate.Bill Currier, head of the Oregon Republican Party, later said that the calls were a simple voter outreach tool.""The Oregon Republican Party is reaching out to legitimately registered Republican voters who are currently marked inactive by the Secretary of State and have not received their ballot,"" Currier told the media. ""Because many of them are not aware that they will not be able to vote and our goal is to help them get their ballot so they can cast their vote in this election.""""We have been aware that some dishonest efforts are (being) made to mischaracterize these calls as attempts to discourage active voters who may have unintentionally received these calls,"" Currier added.""Our efforts to help already registered voters vote should earn applause, not dishonest spin.""Republicans noted that calls like this aimed at getting every Republican voter to mail in a ballot is important especially in light of the 2010 election when GOP candidate Chris Dudley who lost his election for governor by less than one percent.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.SIGN UP"

The FBI focused on Weiner despite the fact that it had the authority to re-open Hillary Clinton backup devices that were not opened during the first investigation.The Republican National Committee, through chairman Reince Priebus, pointed out that the FBI is still investigating the Clinton Foundation for public corruption. Chuck Grassley is making it clear that James Comey is probably going to be back before his committee at some point in the near future.""The growing number of unanswered questions demand explanations: Is the FBI continuing to review the newly-revealed emails? Did the FBI limit its review to email from when Clinton was Secretary of State, leaving out emails that could shed light on possible obstruction of Congress?"" Grassley said.""Did the Justice Department authorize an application for a search warrant for this latest review, and if so, was it the first time such a tool was used in this investigation?

Among those with a union member in their household, Clinton only leads Trump 50 percent to 45 percent.Trump also leads with first-time voters, with 57 percent backing him. Clinton and Trump are statistically tied with voters aged 18 to 24, at 51 percent and 49 percent respectively. Clinton leads with voters between the ages of 25 and 44, and Trump has the 75 years and older vote locked up.The Dispatch's poll also found 36 percent of voters surveyed already cast their ballots. Among those who voted early, Clinton leads by ten percentage points.Another Ohio poll conducted by CBS News and YouGov finds Trump leading Clinton by one percentage point, 46 percent to 45 percent, in a race that also includes third-party candidates. Their poll, which collected responses from 1,189 likely voters and has a margin of error of 4.1 percentage points, found 19 percent of respondents had already voted in Ohio. Of those who had not yet cast a ballot, 84 percent said they plan to vote on Election Day.Enthusiasms are running high: 73 percent said they ""can't wait to vote,"" and 97 percent said their presidential choice was strong or very strong. Another 69 percent said they will wait in line ""as long as it takes"" to vote.And enthusiasm appears to be on Trump's side: Asked, ""how do you feel about voting for Donald Trump compared to past Presidential candidates you've supported,"" 55 percent of Trump supporters said they are more enthusiastic about him than past GOP presidential candidates. But only 32 percent of Clinton supporters said the same about her, with a plurality, 37 percent said they are less enthusiastic.Whether or not those numbers will translate into a win or defeat for either candidate in Ohio remains to be seen. While 75 percent of Democrats say they plan to vote on Election Day, 85 percent of independents and 89 percent of Republicans plan to cast their ballots then. A quarter of Democratic voters already sent in their ballots, explaining Clinton's lead in early voting. White voters back Trump over Clinton 53 percent to 37 percent, while black voters support Clinton 95 percent to four percent. About 31 percent of black voters cast their ballots early, and 68 percent plan to vote on Election Day. Among white voters, only 13 percent voted early and 86 percent plan to vote on Election Day. Ohio's demographics show the state is 85 percent white, 11.5 percent black, and 1.9 percent Hispanic.YouGov states early voters (19 percent of those surveyed) ultimately favored Clinton over Trump 63 percent to 33 percent. But among the overwhelming majority of voters who have yet to cast their ballots, Trump leads Clinton 49 percent to 41 percent.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERDemocrats used their extensive get-out-the-vote organization in Las Vegas and the surrounding Clark County to get 324,239 registered Democrats to vote early. They won a lead of 72,000 voters in Clark County, but the GOP offset that in other areas with a statewide turnout of 276,611 registered Republicans. That leaves a state-wide Democratic lead of 48,000 more registered voters.But an unknown number of Republicans and Democrats voted across party lines, muddying up the estimated GOP shortfall. If Trump gained 7 points more than he lost in the party-switching -- as some poll-watchers estimate --then Hillary Clinton's apparent advantage shrinks from 48,000 votes to 25,000 votes. In addition, 167,148 independents also cast ballots during the the early voting period. If Trump has a 7 percent advantage among these voters, as claimed by some estimates, Trump could have already banked a 12,000 vote-lead in this independent group over Clinton. If so, Trump has reduced the estimated post-party-switching shortfall of 25,000 votes down to 13,000 votes.But 769,948 Nevadans have already cast their ballots, leaving only about 385,000 Nevadans likely to vote on election day, according to the pattern set by the 2008 and 2012 elections. To make up that 48,000-vote to 13,000-vote shortfall on election day, Trump's grassroots will have to boost their turnout by roughly 10 percent or 20 percent or even 30 percent, from perhaps 180,000 Trump supporters to 195,000 Trump supporters or even 210,000 Trump supporters. That task could get tougher, because the Democrats' union-powered turnout-machine is also identifying all of Clinton's supporters who didn't vote early, so they can be bussed, driven and dragged to the poll on Nov. 8. Still, a poll conducted Oct. 29 to Nov. 1 showed Trump leading Clinton in Nevada by 48 percent to 43 percent, while libertarian Gary Johnson gets only 5 percent. The poll of 723 people was conducted via the Internet by the People's Pundit Daily website. The RealClearPolling site tracks multiple polls and shows Trump in the lede with 46 percent support, 44 percent for Clinton and 4 percent for Johnson.

On May 5, 2016, her spokesman Josh Schwerin told Huffington Post Clinton ""believes Heller was wrongly decided in that cities and states should have the power to craft common sense laws to keep their residents safe.""Neither Schwerin or Clinton point out that the law Heller struck down was a ban that the prevented law-abiding Washington, D.C. residents from owning handguns. And far from keeping residents safe, that law simply empowered criminals who continued to possess handguns.Writing in Real Clear Politics, author William Bennett warned that the Second Amendment would be a ""primary target"" for a Clinton-stacked SCOTUS and that her activism would not be directed toward Heller alone.

The most recent one is H.B. 2023, signed by Gov. Doug Ducey earlier this year. This law allows for election workers, postal workers, family members, household members, caretakers, and various other types of persons to handle, collect, and deliver a voter's early ballot, but makes it a felony for an authorized person to do so.Hillary Clinton's campaign, the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the Arizona Democratic Party, and various liberal groups sued in federal court. These plaintiffs include those who organize teams to show up at voters' homes to collect ballots.Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan and Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich argued that without this law, unauthorized persons might pressure a voter to fill out their ballot where the collector can see the markings, and might pressure voters to vote for particular candidates, or discard ballots after collection if they believe a particular voter did not vote for the person the collector supports.The U.S. district court ruled in favor of Arizona, and a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in a 2-1 decision.But then Clinton and the Democrats petitioned the full Ninth Circuit to rehear the case en banc, and on Nov. 4 an 11-judge panel of the San Francisco-based appeals court reversed the three-judge panel in a narrowly split 6-5 decision.This en banc decision was written by Chief Judge Sidney Thomas, a liberal Democrat considered for the Supreme Court by President Barack Obama. Thomas had been part of the original three-judge panel, and was the dissenting judge among them.In his panel dissent, he argued that H.B. 2023 violates the U.S. Constitution and also the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965. Thomas dropped all such references in the en banc opinion, writing for the liberal majority that the court was merely maintaining the status quo (meaning the state's laws before H.B. 2023 was passed) until after the election, and then would render a final decision on the merits.Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain wrote the principal dissent for the five dissenting judges, beginning:The court misinterprets (and ultimately sidesteps Purcell v. Gonzalez) to interfere with a duly established election procedure while voting is currently taking place, contrary to the Supreme Court's command not to do so. I thus respectfully dissent from this order enjoining the State of Arizona from continuing to follow its own laws during an ongoing election. And let there be no mistake: despite the majority's pretense to the contrary, the order granting the injunction is a ruling on the merits, and one based on an unnecessarily hasty review and an unsubstantiated statutory and constitutional analysis.The reference to Purcell is that the Supreme Court held in 2006 that when courts are asked to interfere with state election laws only days or weeks before an election, they must regard that as an additional factor counseling restraint, weighing against inserting the judiciary into the political process.The very next day after the en banc ruling--Saturday, Nov. 5--the Supreme Court took the unusual step of granting a weekend stay, setting aside the Ninth Circuit's en banc order and allowing H.B. 2023 to continue in effect through Tuesday's election. This stay will last at least until the full Ninth Circuit issues an officially final decision on the case's merits next year.There were no published dissents with the stay, but it takes five justices to grant a stay, so at least one of the liberal justices joined along this time.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.
