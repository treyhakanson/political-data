That's an increase of five points.According to the poll, Trump is doing better among single women than failed 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney.

""Maybe we should boycott Starbucks. I don't know.

The organization hopes to roll out even more such events on November 8th.""We've enlisted our most loyal companions to help during this historic election,"" said Nick Ellis, a ""National Puppy Coordinator"" for NextGen Climate. ""We are excited about this new approach to voter outreach."" Ellis appears in an ad for the campaign with an adorable, playful puppy, Petey.The puppy idea arose organically during NextGen Climate's voter registration drives. Volunteers who had puppies with them inevitably gathered more signatures than those without pooches. Deciding that this phenomenon was no accident, NextGen Climate figured that if puppies could get people to sign up to register, surely they could convince people to show up to vote, as well.This makes sense. Anyone stupid enough to choose the next president of the USA based on the rush of oxytocin they experience on looking into the adorable eyes of a juvenile dog is 99.99 per cent likely to be a natural Hillary voter.It also makes sense for NextGen Climate, the Super PAC run by billionaire Tom Steyer who made part of his fortune out of fossil fuels but now sees a brighter future in green activism.If he has called this presidential election correctly then he and the rest of the green mafia stand to benefit hugely, just like they did under the Obama administration: the global warming industry is worth an annual $1.5 trillion - and most of that money is not earned the hard way but rather dispensed, in the manner of some monstrously corrupt 17th century court, by the state to its most slavish courtiers.If, on the other hand, Hillary is defeated then the Green Ponzi scheme will collapse almost immediately - and you should probably sell all the renewable energy shares in your portfolio.It won't be pretty for those puppies, either. I'm not saying that environmentalists are the most evil people in the world - I find that disability campaigners, ME-sufferers, SNP voters and Third Wave Feminists are even more vicious - but I would still expect that if the last ditch puppy trick doesn't work out, we're going to see a tragically large number of wriggling sacks being tossed in rivers near voting locations across the US by the middle of next week.

Riyadh supports the rebels.Earlier this year, the kingdom halted a $3 billion programme of military aid to Lebanon to protest what it said was ""the stranglehold of Hezbollah on the state"".It also urged its citizens to leave Lebanon and avoid travel to the country.SIGN UPRIYADH (AFP) - "	[]	[]

Members of the Iraqi forces told Reuters the documents originated from Islamic State, although this could not be independently verified.Iraqi security forces and Kurdish peshmerga fighters have seized several villages and towns during an offensive against the northern city of Mosul, Islamic State's last stronghold in the country.When Islamic State swept through the north in 2014, it announced a self-proclaimed caliphate, which appealed to some fellow Sunnis who felt marginalized by the Shi'ite-led central government.But that appeal faded as Islamic State enforced its medieval thinking with brute force, beheading anyone deemed an opponent.Slick, colorful posters, pamphlets and documents highlight Islamic State's intense focus on dictating what it called proper Islamic behavior for the citizens of its caliphate.Violations of its rules meant punishment such as public whipping or being hauled off to Mosul for execution, according to several villagers who recently escaped from Islamic State areas.A green wallet-size insert lays out guidelines for how to pray properly. It shows a young boy undertaking ablutions. ""Wash your feet from the direction of your toes down to your heels,"" it said.GOLD BRACELETSA five-page pamphlet with pictures of gold bracelets, diamond rings and wheat on the front spelled out instructions on how to give alms, an obligation under Islam. Failure to do so would mean a penalty.In the village of Shura, where seven Islamic State suicide bombers were recently shot dead as they rushed toward Iraqi forces, militants kept meticulous records of who had given alms. Entries showed whether an individual owned gold, property or a car. Monthly salaries were also noted.Unlike al Qaeda, its predecessor in Iraq, Islamic State made its name in the jihadi world by becoming the first militant group to capture significant amounts of land in the Middle East, hold it and then set up an administration.But air strikes by a U.S.-led coalition targeting Islamic State's leaders and its sources of income have dealt a major blow to the caliphate.Islamic State's inclination to codify its system of rule extended to what it called the spoils of war.A pink and red pamphlet includes 32 questions and answers on how to deal with female captives.A senior Islamic State cleric has the authority to distribute female captives among its fighters, it said.""Non-Muslim women can be taken as concubines,"" according to the leaflet.Militants can own two sisters as concubines but only have sex with one.""Pre-pubescent girls can be taken as concubines. You cannot have penetrative sex but you can still enjoy them,"" the leaflet added.One question in the pamphlet asks whether a group of militants can share a concubine. The answer: only a single owner can sleep with a concubine.After blazing through northern Iraq, Islamic State took hundreds of women from the Yazidi minority as sex slaves.Under Islamic State's rules, women were required to largely stay at home or wear head-to-toe black coverings if they ventured out. Men wore short pants which were deemed Islamic along with beards of appropriate length.One of the pamphlets begins by defining a beard as ""hair that grows on your face and your cheeks"".There were few forms of entertainment under Islamic State, which banned the internet and music along with cell phones.A ban on satellite dishes deprived Iraqis of news of the outside world. In a huge slick poster, entitled ""Why I Should Destroy My Dish"", the jihadists provided 20 reasons, revolving mostly around the immorality of satellite television programs.Reason 8: ""Because satellite channels show stories of love and naked women and inappropriate language.""Reason 10: ""Because satellite channels normalize men being effeminate and sissies.""SIGN UPwomenwomen"	[]	[]

Nearly the opposite is true among Trump supporters, with 56% saying they have no trouble respecting someone who backs Clinton and 40% saying they do have trouble with it.That's a 17-point tolerance difference between the two parties.Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump holds a campaign rally at the Bank of Colorado Arena on the campus of University of Northern Colorado October 30, 2016 in Greeley, Colorado.The pro-Clinton group that has the most difficulty tolerating their political rivals are white women, many of whom are university educated. Pew's poll showed that 68 percent of this group ""have a hard time"" respecting Trump's supporters. Also, 66 percent of all Clinton women supporters with college qualifications have a hard time respecting Trump's supporters.In contrast, 53 percent of Clinton's non-college female supporters say they have a hard time reconciling with Trump's supporters. There's little difference between the various groups of Trump supporters, except for age.The least tolerant Trump group are men older than 65, but only 45 percent of them say they have a hard time respecting Clinton supporters. That's 21 points lower than the intolerance among Clinton's female college-educated supporters.The most tolerant of Trump's group are young people aged 18 to 34, of whom only 29 percent ""have a hard time"" dealing with Clinton's supporters.This younger group of Trump's supporters is a mirror image of Clinton's female groups, because more than two-thirds of Trump's young supporters -- 69 percent -- say they ""have no trouble"" respecting Clinton supporters.Clinton's younger supporters, however, are far less tolerant that Trump's younger supporters. They're 32 percentage points less willing to tolerate their peers in Trump's campaign.Pew's large survey of 2,583 adults, including 2,120 registered voters, was conducted from Oct. 20 to Oct. 25, well after Trump was portrayed as a sexual predator by Clinton and her allies, and well after Trump's supporters had been carefully described by Clinton as insanely hostile and unAmerican.Here's Clinton's full Sept. 9 statement at her fundraiser with gay supporters;""You know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic -- you name it. And unfortunately there are people like that. And he has lifted them up. He has given voice to their websites that used to only have 11,000 people, now have 11 million. He tweets and retweets offensive, hateful, mean-spirited rhetoric. Now some of those folks, they are irredeemable, but thankfully they are not America.Clinton's speech spotlights the difficulty that Democrats have in keeping their diverse, chaotic and often incompatible coalition united in the run-up to an election. There's little to unite this diversity except shared hostility to their supposedly hateful political rivals, which is echoed in Clinton's slogans, ""Stronger Together"" and ""Love trumps hate.""In contrast, Trump has united most of the GOP's fewer factions -- employees, employers, social-conservatives and foreign policy hawks -- around a unifying nationalist message, ""Make America Great Again.""October 17, 2016 in Green Bay, Wisconsin.Read the Pew survey here. nearly six-in-ten registered voters who back Clinton (58%) say they have a ""hard time"" respecting someone who supports Trump for president; 40% say they have ""no trouble"" with it. Nearly the opposite is true among Trump supporters, with 56% saying they have no trouble respecting someone who backs Clinton and 40% saying they do have trouble with it.

On Sunday, Clinton made an appearance at New Mount Olive Baptist Church and at Betty's soul food restaurant in the same neighborhood.Right away, she took a shot at Trump after a heckler in the crowd shouted ""Bill Clinton is a rapist.""""I get sometimes a little overwhelmed by the fact that I love this country,"" Clinton declared. ""I think we already are great. I think we could be greater, and, you know, I am sick and tired of the negative, dark, divisive, dangerous vision and behavior of people who support Donald Trump. It is time for us to say, 'No, we are not going backwards. We are going forward into a brighter future.'  So how do we do that? For the next seven days, we focus on what is important, do not get distracted or diverted - focus on the kind of country and world that we want to help create.""Pro-Trump heckler escorted out of Hillary rally by police. Goes out shouting ""Trump 2016"" pic.twitter.com/d3GQjSFHHz-- Jeff Poor (@jeff_poor) November 2, 2016Clinton rattled off her list of policy positions, which included pay equality, climate change, same-sex marriage, the war on terror, gun control, college debt, health care and taxes. Then she urged supporters to stage an ""intervention"" if they knew someone who was going to vote Trump.""I want you to do me another favor, if you know anybody who says they are thinking of voting for Trump, I want you to stage an intervention,"" Clinton said. ""And I want you to talk to this person because unless they are a billionaire who avoided paying taxes for 20 years and lost a billion dollars running casinos, they do not have anything to gain from Donald Trump. In fact, they do have so much to lose. Every single issue we care about may not be actually listed on the ballot but make no mistake, it is on there. And talk to your friend or coworker and say, 'You know, really, you may be angry about something that anger is not a plan. Don't be used. Don't be exploited. Stand up for what we can do together.' Because that is what this election comes down to. It is about our future. It is about who we are as a country.One of the reoccurring themes of Clinton and her running mate Tim Kaine's appearances in Florida has been urging attendees to participate in the early voting process. It was on display again on Wednesday as the venue for the rally was next to an early voting center and giant ""Vote Early"" letters were place above a riser behind her podium.""[W]e know that we've got to turn out the vote. And what that means is that every one of you who can should vote early. How many of you have already voted?"" she said to wide applause. ""That does not surprise me because 4 million people in Florida have already voted, but there are millions more that we have got to get to go out and vote.""Opening for Clinton were Reps. John Lewis (D-GA), Patrick Murphy (D-FL) and Alcee Hastings (D-FL). Murphy, who is in a race for the U.S. Senate against incumbent Sen. Marco Rubio, was received by the crowd with ""beat Rubio"" chants. Others appearing at the rally for Clinton were Reps.

Those numbers match the data provided in a recent TIPP poll for Investors Business Daily. Based on TIPP's data, and the 4 million early votes cast by Monday, Trump will get 45.4 percent of the state's vote -- and the November win -- if the NPA vote splits 48 percent for Trump, 33 percent for Hillary Clinton, and 19 percent for third parties, including Jill Stein of the Green Party.  That scenario would leave Clinton with 42.1 percent of the statewide vote, and third-party candidates would get 12.5 percent of the statewide votes. If polling data from The Washington Post is used to allocate the Republican, Democratic, and NPA early voters to the various candidates, then current early voting trends show Trump beating Clinton by 5 points, 47.68 percent to 42.68 percent. By Monday, 4,077,521 Floridians had voted. They included 1.648 million registered Republicans, 1.623 million registered Democrats, and 697,783 NPA voters. So far, the Republicans are staying just ahead of the Democrats in the early voting, while the NPA voters comprise a decisive, election-swinging 16.95 percent of the early vote. That's one in six voters.Also, black American turnout in the state has dropped sharply, creating more bad news for the Clinton team. In 2012, after just two days of early in-person voting, black Americans contributed 25 percent of the vote. In 2016, despite five days of early voting, black Americans comprised only 16 percent of voters by Monday. But experts warn that Florida's early voting numbers in 2016 are distinctly different from the 2012 early voting numbers.The state's population has changed with the addition of many voters from Puerto Rico, while many more voters are voting earlier than in prior years because of pressure from state election officials and from the two political parties. Those early GOP voters won't be able to vote again on November 8 to counter any last-minute surge among Democratic voters.  The parties want their supporters to vote early, partly so they can concentrate their resources late in the race on turning out their most cautious or hesitant supporters. So whatever the early voting numbers and current polling show today, the final result won't be known until November 8 -- or whenever all of the uncertain votes and ""hanging chads"" are determined during a recount after a very close race.SIGN UPFlorida's early voting numbers show that Donald Trump is on track to win the state if he can gather support from half of the state's ""No Party Affiliated"" voters by November 8.The calculation assumes that Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton each keep 87 percent of their partisan supporters in Florida, gain 4 percent or 5 percent from the other party, and lose 8 percent or 9 percent to third-party candidates.

He has also, Hannah-Jones writes, integrated the black working class into the mainstream of ""hard-working"" Americans. In that way, she says, he has put black Americans into a position where they have real political power, if they want to use it.She writes:Whatever his motives, Trump was talking about the black working class in a way that few national politicians do.......

What dividends, exactly, has their decades-long loyalty to the Democratic ticket paid them? By brushing Trump's criticism off as merely cynical or clueless rantings, we are missing an opportunity to have a real discussion of the failures of progressivism and Democratic leadership when it comes to black Americans.Trump is not wrong when he says that black Americans have suffered in a particular way in blue cities and blue states.

That's why Hillary is now only saying she has problems with the TPP 'in its current form,' - ensuring that she can rush to embrace it again at her earliest opportunity.""Indeed, during a recent CNBC interview, Bill Clinton said that the case for approving the TPP is ""clear."" Similarly, just last week, Clinton's running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine, seemed to leave the door open to the possibility that a Hillary Clinton administration would pass an Asian trade deal similar to the TPP, declaring ""you never close the door"" on passing this type of multi-national trade deal.The Washington Post has reported that Clinton's agenda on foreign trade would likely be advanced by Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan. Like Clinton, Ryan has been an enthusiastic advocate for globalist trade policies. In 2015, Ryan was President Obama's ""partner"" in their effort to fast-track the Trans-Pacific Partnership. In a 2015 Wall Street Journal op-ed, Ryan described the TPP as an ""historic"" agreement which ""would mean greater access to a billion customers for American manufacturers, farmers and ranchers.""However, like Clinton, Ryan was forced to rhetorically distance himself from his prior support for TPP when faced with a primary challenge this past summer.""After spending more than a year praising the TPP, and pushing through the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) package needed to grease the skids for it last year, Ryan"" backed away slightly from his former position as a result of his contentious primary battle in Wisconsin's first Congressional district, Breitbart reported earlier this year. ""I have my own problems with TPP. It is not ready,"" Ryan said of the 12-nation trade pact in August- indicating that he'd be open to enacting a tweaked version of the agreement at a later date. While campaigning, Ryan told his Wisconsin constituents that he wouldn't bring the deal up for a vote during the lame-duck session of Congress ""as long as we don't have the votes.""A recent blockbuster POLITICO pro-Harvard poll found that among those who have heard of the TPP, 63% oppose it and 68% think it ""should not be voted on until the new Congress comes into office after the lame-duck session.""The polling data also revealed that a majority of Americans reject the globalist trade agenda of Washington leaders like Clinton and Ryan. By a five-to-one margin, Americans believe that trade policies with other countries have lost American jobs. By a nearly four-to-one margin, Americans believe our trade policies have lowered rather than raised wages. Only 14% of Americans believe our trade policies have raised U.S. wages.Yet if Forman's predictions are correct, the public's opposition to such deals will not stop elected representatives in Congress from voting to enact one of the largest multinational trade agreements in history.Trump has previously made the case that a Trump presidency is the only way to stop the passage of TPP.""Our leaders have negotiated terrible deals that are bleeding this country dry,"" Trump told Breitbart News earlier this year. ""The TPP is another terrible one-sided deal that rewards offshoring and enriches other countries at our expense. I will stop Hillary's Obamatrade in its tracks...""Indeed, while Clinton now publicly claims to oppose the deal, in a private speech made public by WikiLeaks, Clinton made clear that she believes politicians need to have ""both a public and a private position"" on every issue.During a closed-door speech delivered to Goldman Sachs executives, Clinton declared that her ""dream"" is for a ""hemispheric common market with open trade.""Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein has explained how both Republican and Democrat establishment politicians are united in their efforts to push the globalist trade deal that will ""give corporations more power than nations.""Both Democrats & Republicans are pushing the TPP, a secret trade deal that would give corporations more power than nations. #NoTPP-- Dr. Jill Stein (@DrJillStein) October 28, 2016Stein and her party have explained how the TPP will be ""NAFTA on steroids"" and will ""enrich wealthy corporations by exporting jobs and pushing down wages.""

And as they've rallied entirely behind Kelly, after Kelly made a move to oust Roger Ailes as the chairman of the company, alleging without evidence that he made an unwanted sexual advance against her years ago, the network's ratings have collapsed.Kelly has also emerged as the network's leading anti-Donald Trump voice, using her platform to try to disparage the Republican presidential nominee and his supporters. The highest profile spat, which came last week, was a battle she had with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich over former President Bill Clinton's alleged sexual assaults and alleged rapes.In mid-October, Kelly continued parading her anti-Trump narrative as she's done throughout the course of the campaign. Since she took a position against him early in the primaries in the summer of 2015, MSNBC's Rachel Maddow on at least two occasions beat Kelly in both the demo and overall ratings.""Rachel Maddow made history last week when her show beat Fox News' The Kelly File in both total viewers and the key news demo of adults age 25-54 on Thursday... then it happened again on Friday,"" The Wrap's Brian Flood wrote on Oct. 20. ""Thursday's victory was the first time The Rachel Maddow Show has ever beaten Fox News in both categories. She averaged 609,000 demo viewers and 2.5 million total viewers. Maddow's show debuted in 2008. The momentum continued, at least in the demo, on Monday when Maddow beat CNN and Fox News among viewers age 25-54, but fell to Megyn Kelly's The Kelly File in total viewers.""SIGN UP"	['Hill', 'Trump']	[]

The campaign writes:Hillary Clinton supported the ""new, improved"" Korea trade deal and said it would create more exports and more jobs.vIn reality, the U.S. trade deficit with Korea surged $15.4 billion (99 percent). The increase in the U.S. trade deficit with Korea equates to the loss of more than 102,500 American jobs in the first four years of the deal. After the Korea Free Trade Agreement, the U.S. trade deficit with Korea in the top ten products that New Mexico exports to Korea - including everything from transportation equipment to metal manufacturing- exploded 117 percent as exports stagnated and imports rose... In the first four years of the Korea [Free Trade Agreement], U.S. exports to Korea of dairy products- a top New Mexico agricultural export - plummeted 88 percent compared to the annual average of the four years before the [agreement].Most significantly, Trump's campaign argues that ""Hillary's TPP [Trans Pacific Partnership agreement] will do even more damage."" It says:The TPP would destroy lives in New Mexico and across the country. Hillary Clinton supports the TPP. Donald Trump will kill the TPP. The TPP grants special rights to 81 foreign corporations to sue New Mexico before secret international tribunals. These panels can require New Mexico's taxpayers to pay unlimited sums for the corporations' loss of expected future profits. These foreign corporations need only convince the lawyers that a U.S. or New Mexico law violates their TPP rights. Their decisions are not subject to appeal and the amount they can award has no limit.Hillary Clinton played a ""leading part in drafting the Trans Pacific Partnership,"" according to Bloomberg, and is on record as having praised or promoted the deal at least 45 times, according to CNN.During the campaign, Clinton was eventually forced to distance herself from her prior support for TPP-now publicly claiming to oppose the deal in its current form. However, as she explained in a private speech made public by WikiLeaks, Clinton believes politicians need to have ""both a public and a private position"" on every issue.In a private speech to Goldman Sachs executives, Clinton said that her ""dream""  is for a ""hemispheric common market with open trade.""Clinton's support for globalist trade policies has earned her criticism from conservatives and liberal progressives alike.Are you still against the TPP, @HillaryClinton?

His ""message for any Democratic voters who have already cast"" their ballots was that Wisconsin is one of the states that allowed them to change their minds. (Minnesota is another.)Trump traveled to the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire as he continued his attempt to expand the electoral map with an appearance Tuesday evening in this rural town in a state known historically for its ""progressive"" politics.Earlier in the day, Trump had delivered a policy address on Obamacare in Pennsylvania. On Monday, he campaigned in Michigan, and on Sunday, he visited Nevada, Colorado, and New Mexico -- all states that have recently trended Democratic, but where some polls suggest Trump is competitive with Hillary Clinton.The Clinton campaign announced Tuesday that it will campaign in Michigan on Friday, and it is spending money on new ads in states it once considered secure.Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani spoke at the event, as did local political leaders: Rep. Sean Duffy of the local 7th district, Wisconsin GOP chair Brad Courtney, Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus, and Gov. Scott Walker.Only one prominent Wisconsin leader, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, was absent. Ryan withdrew from a ""unity"" event last month after the release of a video from Access Hollywood in 2005 showing Trump joking about groping women.Trump praised Walker: ""I want to tell you, I ran against him. He is tough,"" Trump said.Trump added that Hillary Clinton had cheated in her presidential debates with Bernie Sanders by having questions provided in advance by CNN contributor Donna Brazile.Brazile is now the chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), after the resignation of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), who was alleged to have colluded with the Clinton campaign after Wikileaks released emails from the DNC in July.""She was just fired from the network. She should resign from DNC,"" Trump said.Trump hit many of his familiar points from the trail, including his argument that Hillary Clinton's eagerness to intervene in Syria could lead to a confrontation with Russia ""that, frankly, for all we know, could trigger World War III.""The most recent public Wisconsin poll, by Remington Research, shows Trump 4 points behind Hillary Clinton, just outside the poll's 2.9% margin of error.Joel B.

A number of precedents established at the domestic level in other democracies lend further support to this view.""Despite being called a ""Zionist billionaire"" in Iranian media, Soros has a long history of funding Palestinian and Israeli NGOs that demonize Israel.Earlier this year, Breaking the Silence's soldier testimonies came under scrutiny in an expose on Israeli television.The State Attorney's Office claims that addressing the alleged ""war crimes"" is more important than maintaining anonymity and is demanding that BtS reveal the soldier's identity.BtS's lawyer Michael Sfard told the court in May that a ruling against the NGO would be a major blow to Israeli democracy and freedom of speech, the Jerusalem Post reported.Ad Kan! argued that were BtS awarded media privilege it would still be insufficient, since even journalists are subject to reprimand and must adhere to ethics boards. BtS, on the other hand, is not supervised by any board and giving them media privileges would effectively grant them carte blanche to delegitimize Israel.SIGN UP"	['Israel']	[]

They held a variety of anti-Trump signs, ranging from the angry to the zany.
Protesters also led several chants, including ""Black Lives Matter!"" and ""Make America Native Again!""Breitbart News spoke to one student who held a curious sign reading, ""Trump Deletes Tweets.""She explained that he often tries to hide the evidence when he says ""controversial things."" She also intended the sign as a counter to Trump's complaints that Hillary Clinton deleted her emails. She looked on, seemingly with approval, as Breitbart News tweeted the photo.Later, she approached Breitbart News and asked if the tweet could be deleted.Two male students held up a sign promoting the Islamic faith:And two female students held a sign reading: ""Friends don't let friends vote Trump.""One, Lindsay Hein, said she did not have any friends who were actually voting for Trump, but that some of her relatives were, and they had decided not to discuss politics. The other, Shannon Gunderman, said that one of her friends was at the Trump rally, and that they had discussed the election in a spirit of mutual respect. ""We talk even though we disagree.""On the other side, Jake Smith, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who served two tours of duty in Afghanistan, held his 16-month-old son, Wyatt, and sported a ""Bomb the shit out of ISIS"" button.He had driven to the rally from Minnesota, he said, because he was pro-military and pro-gun. He also said he hoped to see ""more detail"" about Trump's economic policies, and wanted to make sure Trump would ""not decrease the size of our military, but keep our military strong.""Another Trump supporter, Pearl, a housewife who drove from Minneapolis to be at the event, said she was determined not to see Hillary Clinton elected president. ""I think this country's really gone bad if we elect her -- she belongs in jail,"" she said.Asked about the protesters across the street, Pearl said: ""They don't look too bad. I don't think Hillary paid these ones.""She added: ""As usual, they can't even spell.""She seemed to be referring to a sign accusing Trump of ""rasism"":As shouts were volleyed back and forth across the police cordon, several female students began chanting, ""Get off my campus!""One of them told Breitbart News that while she supports free speech, ""what I don't respect is that students of color are attacked by Trump supporters yelling 'Go back where you came from'.""She said one such incident had happened that day.People continued to arrive at the rally, standing patiently outside in the cooling air as the sun began to set, despite the fact that there was unlikely to be any room left in the building.The Zorn Arena holds 3,500 people in the bleachers, and has room for roughly 1,000 additional people on the floor.(Special thanks to Phil of Eau Claire Bike Cabs.)Joel B.

In an October 31 statement, CNN lamented, ""We are completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor.""The behind the scenes collusion was so blatant it drove GOP nominee Donald Trump to say he would be sent ""to the electric chair"" if he had been caught cheating so obviously.However, despite the revelations and the lack of any evidence that the emails revealing Brazile's actions are false, the DNC operative has continued to deny the charge of collusion.Despite being fired by CNN, in an interview with Fox News, Brazile even insisted, ""[A]s far as I know, that, CNN has never provided me with questions, absolutely, ever.""Brazile also hyperbolically proclaimed that any questions about her behavior is like ""Christian persecution.""And even after the latest revelations, Brazile tried to spin the discussion by criticizing the source of the leaked documents and disparaging them as ""stolen"" in an effort to discredit the actual charge that she supplied the Clinton campaign with insider information.I did not expect to come out of this unscathed.

If the Clinton campaign can deny Trump a victory in the Tar Heel state, his path to an electoral majority narrows significantly.Struggling with multiple scandals and the FBI's decision to reopen the investigation into Hillary's handling of classified information, the Clinton campaign's choice to make their final stand in a state where they need to outperform President Obama reeks of desperation.As the Trump campaign expands campaign operations into states like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which until recently were considered safe Clinton victories, President Obama, Vice President Biden, former President Bill Clinton, VP nominee Tim Kaine, comedian Will Ferrell, HBO's Lena Dunham, rapper NE YO, and Hillary herself are making separate campaign appearances here in the final days before the November 8th election.Hillary struggles to piece together the Obama coalitionThe Clinton campaign's tactics and messaging here show they are worried about the lack of enthusiasm with major voting blocs in the winning Obama coalition. Early voting shows turnout among North Carolina's black voters lagging behind Obama in 2012 and polling shows her bleeding support with millennials. The campaign is turning to surrogates without Hillary's baggage to turn out these critical voting blocs.A radio ad airing on one of Charlotte's R&B/Hip-Hop radio stations, 92.7 The Block, barely mentions Hillary and instead focuses on President Obama. ""My legacy is on the ballot,"" Obama roars in the ad. ""Tolerance is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Good schools are on the ballot."" Noticeably absent among the things Obama lists as being on the ballot is the person whose name actually appears on the ballot, Hillary Clinton. Other radio and video ads released by the Clinton campaign and their allies attempt to focus the attention away from Clinton and to Obama.Obama will also stump for Hillary at an event aimed at millennials at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on Wednesday. Over the Halloween weekend, the Clinton campaign deployed Lena Dunham and Will Ferrell to colleges across the state to woo millennials, many of whom are angry over collusion between the Democrat Party, DNC, and Clinton campaign to rig the Democrat presidential primary against Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.Clinton slides in polls despite spending advantageClinton has held a small lead in North Carolina polling, but two polls sampled after the FBI reopened the criminal investigation into her emails show Trump surging into the lead. A SurveyUSA poll conducted over the weekend shows Trump opening up a seven-point lead, 51-44%.The Clinton campaign has spent $5.5 million in the state, while the Trump campaign has spent less than $2 million, according to OpenSecrets.Clinton campaign loads schedule with NC events in final dayVice President Joe Biden will campaign in Charlotte and rapper NE YO will hold a free ""Get Out The Vote"" concert in Raleigh Tuesday evening.President Obama will campaign in Chapel Hill on Wednesday.Hillary is scheduled to make a campaign stop in the state on Thursday, although the campaign has not released details.President Obama will hold separate campaign events in Fayetteville and Charlotte on November 4th.Trump adds two campaign stops in NC on ThursdayThe Trump campaign announced today that Trump will hold rallies in Concord and Selma North Carolina on ThursdayDustin Stockton is a political reporter for Breitbart News, a community liaison for Gun Owners of America, and a political strategist.
