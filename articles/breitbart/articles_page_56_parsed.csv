More than a quarter of all deaths are children.No UN aid convoy has entered Aleppo since July 7 and food rations will run out by the end of October, Ban warned, saying hunger was being used as a weapon of war.The meeting at the General Assembly was called by 72 countries led by Canada to try to break the deadlock after the Security Council failed to take action to end the bombings and revive peace efforts.Two resolutions were defeated during a stormy council session earlier this month, one of which was vetoed by Russia, which is backing the Syrian regime in its war against opposition fighters and jihadists.Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said he was ""puzzled"" by the statements at the meeting because they failed to mention the urgent need to combat terrorism in Syria.Churkin said Ban and others had not pronounced ""a single word to talk about terrorist organizations, as if the disaster in Syria was like the hurricane that hit Haiti.""US, Russia clashRussia has long maintained that it is supporting the regime of President Bashar al-Assad in a war against the Islamic State and Al-Qaeda-linked jihadists, both designated as terror organizations by the United Nations.US Ambassador Samantha Power shot back.""Let us be real: terrorists are not the ones dropping bunker-busting bombs on hospitals and civilian homes in eastern Aleppo, nor are they besieging civilians there,"" she said.""The Assad regime and Russia are.""Canada's Foreign Minister Stephane Dion called for a formal emergency session of the General Assembly to discuss urgent measures that could be taken by the 193 UN member-states.""We need to act and to act now,"" he said.It remained unclear what concrete action the assembly -- whose resolutions are non-binding -- could take to address the humanitarian crisis in Syria.The gathering was seen by some diplomats as an attempt to turn up the pressure on Russia and Syria to halt the bombing of Aleppo.Russia this week declared a humanitarian pause in the assault on eastern Aleppo, where more than 250,000 civilians have been trapped, under near-continuous siege since July.SIGN UP"	[]	[]

The Home Office says it would be quite, quite wrong to test their age by examining their teeth because that would be ""inappropriate and unethical"".SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERUsing your skill and judgement, see if you can guess which aspect of this scandal is most troubling the British celebrity chattering classes, aka the Wankerati.Is it:a) Potentially dangerous illegal migrants are burning their passports and lying about their age in order to take advantage of the gullibility, inefficiency and political correctness of Britain's immigration officers and gain citizenship to which they are in no way entitled, at the expense of more deserving candidates and without the consent of the British people, who are going to be stuck forever with these cheating scumbags;b) The French. It's the bloody French's fault. They've been desperate to get rid of the violent, sexually predatory, criminal mob of migrants making life hell for everyone in the Calais Jungle and this ""Zut alors! But we thought all Syrian children had crow's feet, walking sticks and white beards!"" buck-passing is their devious French way of getting rid of a few of them, knowing the English will be too polite to complain:c) Britain's hard-pressed social services are being overwhelmed. As Harriet Sergeant reports in this must-read article in the Daily Mail, workers in residential care homes are now wearily used to having to house refugees in their 20s and 30s masquerading as children. Naturally, this has a disastrous effect on both the local schools forced to take these patently unsuitable adults into their classrooms, and also on the care homes where these dodgy young men corrupt the real children with drugs, alcohol, and sex.Yes, you guessed correctly: it's none of the above.Instead, what most exercises the Wankerati is this one:d) Expressing any form of reservation about migrants is racist and evil.Taking the lead on this issue was Lily Allen, the privileged millionaire pop starlet daughter of a millionaire comedy actor, best known for her songs about cocaine hangovers, wet patches on bedsheets, and the one about how awful racists are which goes: ""Fuck you. Fuck you very mu-u-u-u-ch."" (I'm actually quite a fan, btw. But that racist song one really was quite demeaningly trite and lame and she really should have nixed it.)Lily went to visit the Calais Jungle for a few hours and was moved to tears by the plight of a 13-year old (or so he claimed) boy from Afghanistan. It subsequently emerged that the boy's father had been a commander in the Islamist group Hezb-e Islami, led by the Butcher of Kabul, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar - but had fled to Britain when it became clear that his side were about to be defeated by the British- and U.S.-backed Northern Alliance. Lily nonetheless felt compelled to apologise on behalf of her country - and then to accuse critics who called her on this of being ""Nazis"".But Lily was merely the bellwether for the celebrity flock who, in the last few days, have been bleating ever more noisily about how terrible it is to criticise refugees, even refugees who claim to be 13 but have the skin, bone-structure, and manner of men fast approaching middle age.Here's Gary Lineker.Wonder what makes some people feel, by sheer good fortune of place of birth, superior to others. I need a lie down.-- Gary Lineker (@GaryLineker) October 19, 2016(Lineker - for the benefit of U.S. readers - is Britain's foremost potato chip salesman and was formerly a successful football player.)What really sent the Wankerati into virtue-signalling overdrive, however, was when they thought they'd spotted a weakness in the refugee opponents' case.Apparently, one of the grown-up looking refugee children that nasty right-wing people, including the nasty right-wing Sun, had criticised on Twitter wasn't actually pretending to be a child at all: he was an interpreter!!!Great was the rejoicing in Wankerdom at this wonderful news. It meant that everyone who had attacked the lovely, sweet, enriching man-children refugees wasn't just evil - but ignorant and wrong, too.Cue, much hopping aboard the Twitter Outrage Bus. (I would put up their tweets but unfortunately the key one has since been taken down so they make no sense.) Among the passengers: Gary Lineker, activist blonde Caroline Criado Perez, comedy scriptwriter David Schneider...But then - as Guido first spotted - disaster struck. It turned out the story was false - the result of a misunderstanding (or possibly worse) by a charity called TACT care.Well, fine. But even supposing for a moment they hadn't been revealed in this way to be self-serving, gullible, virtue-signalling fools desperate to believe any old tittle-tattle which served their cause, even supposing that this particular guy had been an actual interpreter - then so what? Would that invalidate the myriad of other examples of refugee children who patently aren't children but grown-ups? (In Britain, last year, according to Eurostate, 3045 unaccompanied minors claimed asylum, of which 91 per cent were male and only 8 per cent were under 14.)Or is it perhaps, yet another case of the Wankerati doing what they always do: clutching at straws, burying their heads in the sand, and seizing yet another opportunity to pontificate and virtue-signal about a problem that isn't going to affect them much, cushioned as they are by money and celebrity.

More than 100 US special operations forces are embedded with Iraqi units in the offensive, and hundreds more are playing a support role in staging bases.The American had been operating as an explosive ordnance disposal specialist in support of the Iraqi Kurdish force known as the peshmerga, the US officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss details.Roadside bombs and other improvised explosive devices pose a particular danger to advancing Iraqi forces and the US advisers who are with them. The Islamic State group, which has occupied Mosul for more than two years, has prepared extensive defenses in and around the city.As they charged toward the town of Bartella, nine miles (15 kilometers) from Mosul's outskirts, the Iraqi special forces faced another favored weapon in the IS arsenal: armored trucks packed with explosives and driven by suicide bombers. The militants' signature battlefield tactic, the weapons offered a glimpse at what Iraqi forces can expect as they close in on the extremists' biggest urban bastion.The pre-dawn assault on Bartella was part of a multi-pronged operation on eastern approaches to Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. Attack helicopters strafed militant positions as they advanced amid a hail of gunfire.The US-trained special forces, officially known as the Counter Terrorism Service, are widely seen as Iraq's most professional and least sectarian fighters, and have served as the shock troops in previous campaigns against IS. They are expected to lead the charge into Mosul.IS militants unleashed at least nine suicide car and truck bombs against the advancing troops, eight of which were destroyed before reaching their targets, while the ninth struck an armored Humvee, Lt. Col Muntadhar al-Shimmari told The Associated Press.He did not give a casualty figure, but another officer said five Iraqi soldiers were wounded. The officer spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release information.""After we break them in Bartella, everywhere else, they will crumble,"" said Maj. Gen. Fadhil Barwari. He said IS had few defenses in the town, which was almost completely empty of civilians. ""They just left some snipers and suicide car bombs,"" he said.Meanwhile, Iraqi Kurdish forces announced a simultaneous attack, with peshmerga fighters deployed on mountains northeast of Mosul descending from their positions and charging toward the front line.Under cover of mortar and gunfire, the Kurdish troops used bulldozers and other heavy equipment to fill trenches dug by the militants as part of their defense of the IS-held village of Barima, then advanced with their armored vehicles toward the extremists' positions.Military operations also appeared to be underway in the town of Bashiqa, northeast of Mosul, where thick smoke could be seen billowing up. A day earlier, Bashiqa was pounded by airstrikes and mortar fire from peshmerga positions high above.Lt. Gen. Talib Shaghati told a news conference late Thursday that the special forces had succeeded in retaking Bartella. But Iraqi forces were still facing stiff resistance inside the town shortly before he spoke, and past advances against IS elsewhere in Iraq have often proved fleeting.Soldiers stationed a few miles from Bartella said they watched as some 20 car bombs exploded in the town over the course of the day, each one sending a plume of smoke into the air. By late afternoon the skies over Bartella were black.IS has used the tactic in past battles to wreak havoc among front-line troops, but Iraqi forces have become better at stopping the suicide attackers.""We destroyed the bombs with tanks,"" Sgt. Maj. Qusay Rashid said. ""They are sending all these car bombs now because we're at the beginning of this huge battle. They are trying to put up their best defense.""After Bartella, Iraqi forces advancing toward Mosul will begin to hit villages and suburbs where civilians still live, a factor that will further complicate military operations that rely heavily on artillery and airstrikes to clear territory.Mosul is home to more than a million people, and rights groups fear a potential humanitarian crisis.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said Mosul may fall sooner than expected. The campaign to retake the city, which began Monday, had been expected to last weeks, if not months.Speaking by video transmission to a conference in Paris focused on post-liberation planning for Mosul, the Iraqi leader said the Iraqi ""forces are currently pushing forward ... more quickly than we thought, and more quickly certainly than we established in our plan of campaign.""The Islamic State group captured Mosul and the surrounding area during a lightning advance across northern Iraq in the summer of 2014, and IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi announced the formation of a self-styled caliphate from the pulpit of a Mosul mosque.Iraqi forces crumbled that summer, beating a humiliating retreat and leaving weapons and vehicles behind. But the special forces held together and fought back, and since then they have played a central role in retaking cities and towns from the extremist group.The force was created by US Special Forces shortly after the 2003 invasion to hunt down top insurgents and stage commando raids, but its mandate has since expanded. Its members include Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds, and its human rights record is better than other forces taking part in the operation.Mosul is a Sunni majority town, and many fear the involvement of state-sanctioned Shiite militias in the operation could stoke sectarian tensions. The Shiite militias have said they will not enter the city itself.But even among the special forces there are traces of sectarian fervor. Many of the black Humvees that rode into battle in Bartella were decked with Shiite religious banners in addition to Iraqi flags.Ali Saad, a 26-year-old special forces soldier, said Kurdish forces had asked them to take down the religious banners, but they refused.""They asked if we were militias. We said we're not militias, we are Iraqi forces, and these are our beliefs,"" he said.SIGN UP"	[]	[]

It was only mentioned once in the second debate. And it was ignored again in the third debate. (The vice presidential debate ignored it, too.)SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThat sole mention of Benghazi occurred when Donald Trump brought it up in his own defense, in response to a question about why he had tweeted at three o'clock in the morning. about a dispute with a former Miss Universe.Yes, the debates were that trivial.Here, for the record, is the only mention of Benghazi:COOPER: Mr. Trump, let me follow up with you. In 2008, you wrote in one of your books that the most important characteristic of a good leader is discipline. You said, if a leader doesn't have it, quote, ""he or she won't be one for very long."" In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape.

It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.COOPER: You mentioned sex tape.TRUMP: By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o'clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi. She said who is going to answer the call at 3 o'clock in the morning? Guess what? She didn't answer it, because when Ambassador Stevens...COOPER: The question is, is that the discipline of a good leader?TRUMP: ... 600 -- wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times. Well, she said she was awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o'clock in the morning, but I won't even mention that. But she said she'll be awake. Who's going -- the famous thing, we're going to answer our call at 3 o'clock in the morning. Guess what happened? Ambassador Stevens -- Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help. And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who's her friend and not a good guy, by the way. So, you know, she shouldn't be talking about that.We never had ""what happened at Benghazi?"" -- but we did have ""did you tell people to check out a sex tape at 3 a.m.?"".Trump deserves some criticism for neglecting Benghazi, which he should have brought up in every debate. But the real blame rests with the moderators.Even Fox News' Chris Wallace, who earned praise by conducting the only fair debate of the three, failed to mention Benghazi.Patricia Smith, mother of the late Benghazi hero Sean Smith, told me before the third debate that she hoped to hear about what happened on Sep. 11, 2012 -- and told me afterwards how disgusted she was that it was ignored.A simple, straightforward question would have sufficed.""Secretary Clinton, the Benghazi terror attack happened while you were Secretary of State. Should the voters consider that a test of your ability to perform as commander-in-chief?""For balance, he could have asked Trump a tough follow-up.""Mr. Trump, you have criticized Secretary Clinton on Benghazi. But she has been in the Situation Room, and you have no experience in national security. Are you, sir, ready to be commander-in-chief?""But the only time we heard anything about ""commander-in-chief"" was in the first debate, when Clinton invoked the phrase -- to argue that Trump was unfit to serve in that role.No one -- neither the moderators, nor the candidates -- mentioned it again.It might be argued that Benghazi was an issue for 2012, not 2016; that the person in charge that night was Barack Obama, not Hillary Clinton; that after years of investigation there was no ""smoking gun"" -- ""no scandal at all,"" the Washington Post said.All of that could be true, and the omission of Benghazi would still be a disgrace, not only because so many of the other issues raised were so meaningless, but fundamentally because we still do not know why Americans in danger were left to die alone.What about the future? Will the next president seek the whole truth? What steps will the next president take to ensure that never happens again? How will the men who died -- and saved dozens of others, thanklessly -- be honored for their sacrifice?We have some idea -- from portions of Trump's speeches -- but voters deserved to hear answers in the debates.History will not care whether Miss Universe once had sex on television. History will judge our neglect of the dead, and the carelessness with which we treat our future security.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Smith, the artistic mind behind Clinton Cash: A Graphic Novel, called the best-selling book ""the most subversive foray into pop culture the right has ever attempted.""""The Right has not lost the culture war. The Right has almost ceded the culture war by not engaging, and I really wanted to use the Left's weapons back on them,"" Smith said in August on Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM radio.""It's payback time.

It is about betraying the people's faith that when public monies are spent on services for citizens - from infrastructure to education - none of those funds will be misappropriated for selfish ends. And it is about poisoning the civic spirit of a people - displacing passion with cynicism, and solidarity with suspicion.""And that is why the U.S. Department of Justice has made it a priority to root out, prosecute, and prevent corruption,"" Lynch asserted, explaining that ""what is at stake...is the public's trust that one set of rules apply to all of its members, that we have ordered our markets and our governmental institutions in a fundamentally fair manner, and that our societies will uphold and respect the rule of law.""Lynch said she is proud that the DOJ is ""working tirelessly to detect corruption and bring wrongdoers to justice - no matter how powerful the actors, no matter how complex the crimes, and no matter where the crimes take place.""The attorney general went on to praise the work of the U.S. Attorney Offices and the FBI, which, she said, ""have prosecuted and convicted corrupt officials at all levels of the American government.""Lynch touted dozens of criminal cases against individuals and corporations, and said her department's investigations ""have resulted in the collection of more than $4.4 billion in penalties."" She also boasted of lawsuits brought against companies and individuals by the Securities and Exchange Commission.""We expect businesses and organizations - and anyone acting on behalf of these entities - to play by the rules, whether they act overseas or in the United States,"" Lynch said. ""In our increasingly globalized world, the United States is determined not only to hold U.S. citizens and officials accountable for their crimes, but also to ensure that our financial system offers no haven to those perpetrating corruption abroad.""""In the days ahead, we will continue the hard work of rooting out corruption,"" the attorney general asserted.However, Lynch's remarks come just four months after she met privately with former President Bill Clinton on a private plane.As ABC15 reported, with the scandal involving Clinton's wife - Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton - and her private email server in the midst of being investigated by Lynch's office, and just hours prior to the release of the Benghazi report, the former president met with the current U.S. attorney general.""I did see President Clinton at the Phoenix airport as he was leaving and spoke to myself and my husband on the plane,"" said Lynch about her 30-minute meeting with Clinton, according to the news report. ""Our conversation was a great deal about grandchildren, it was primarily social about our travels and he mentioned golf he played in Phoenix.""However, ABC15 reported Bill Clinton did not play golf during his most recent visit to Phoenix. Clinton reportedly met with prominent real-estate developer Jim Pederson, the former chairman of the Arizona Democratic Party and former candidate for the U.S. Senate.""There was no discussion on any matter pending before the Department or any matter pending with any other body, there was no discussion of Benghazi, no discussion of State Department emails, by way of example,"" Lynch said. ""I would say it was current news of the day, the Brexit decision and what it would mean.""It is about undermining citizens' belief in their elected officials. It is about betraying the people's faith that when public monies are spent on services for citizens - from infrastructure to education - none of those funds will be misappropriated for selfish ends. And it is about poisoning the civic spirit of a people - displacing passion with cynicism, and solidarity with suspicion.SIGN UP"	['Clinton', 'Lynch']	[]

Lamar Smith (R.-Texas), a former chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and a former federal prosecutor.""There is a lengthy process that we go through,"" Smith said. ""After many weeks, many months, we realized we are being stonewalled.""The requests for information began in July, he said.Smith said before Platt River Networks, the committee has never sought to hold someone in contempt.The Colorado-based company has ignored phone calls, official letters, and subpoenas regarding the committee's requests for information related to its investigation of Hillary R. Clinton's handling of classified electronic correspondence and her private email scheme and server that was maintained by Platt River Networks, Smith said.Smith said he was asking questions relating to the security of the private email system used to conduct her official tasks, which is under the jurisdiction of the committee.""Platt River continues to obstruct the Science Committee's investigation into the possible misuse of former secretary of state Clinton's private email server,"" he said. Clinton is the 2016 Democratic nominee for president.Based on emails and other information it has gathered from other sources, the committee is convinced that the company is acting at the direction of Clinton, he said.""These emails not only reveal a smoking gun, but who pulled the trigger,"" the chairman said.""Regrettably, former Secretary Clinton has interfered with the committee's investigation,"" he said.""What is it that former Secretary Clinton does not want us to see?"" he asked. ""What is it that she is hiding?""The chairman said the emails obtained by the committee also show that long-time personal attorney for the Clintons, David Kendall, is coordinating the non-release of information and working to thwart the committee's investigation.Kendall has even directly challenged the chairman and the committee's authority to request information, he said. ""Last month, Kendall sent a letter to the committee that declared certain materials would not be produced.""It was a challenge Smith dismissed.""We will not let our investigation-or let these attorneys-to dictate the scope of lawfully issued subpoenas,"" he said.Smith said that the committee writes three letters before issuing a subpoena, and his decision to ask Congress to hold the company in contempt comes after the company requested a one-week extension Sept. 23, which Smith granted Sept. 28.The Texan said he expected Platt River to comply, as other companies and individuals have complied in the committee's investigation.""Apparently not,"" he said. ""It took them a whole week to decide to give us a two-sentence response.""The response from the company's attorney read:Dear Chairman Smith,I am in receipt of your letter dated September 28, 2016. Neither I nor any personnel at Platt River Networks have anything further to add beyond that contained in my correspondence dated September 23, 2016.Sincerely,//s//Kenneth F. EichnerSmith said it is clear that Clinton is the one directing Platt River Networks to ignore his subpeonas, but he is targeting the company because they are the ones refusing to comply with his order.As the committee chairman, Smith said he intends to call a vote in the committee, when Congress returns from its recess for the lame duck session. Afterwards, the Contempt of Congress resolution would have to clear the Rules Committee before it goes to the floor for a vote.Clinton was trusted to safeguard our nation's secrets and its secured communications, which has been called into question, he said.""The committee wants the truth,"" he said.""The people deserve the truth and the Constitution requires us to get the truth.""Dear Chairman Smith,

During the first week of October, mail-in ballots were sent out to the two hundred and fifty-two voters in the community. Once the ballots were mailed an error was discovered that forced the Pinellas County Elections Commissioner's office to send out a second ballot ten days later with an insert explaining why they were receiving a second ballot. The error at the center of the controversy was a missing field for the city's one contested commission seat.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERJason Latimer, Communications Director for the Pinellas County Supervisor of Elections, insisted that only two of the original ballots were mailed in. He went on to say that those two ballots had not been opened or filed before the mistake was realized. Latimer insisted that the supervisor's system would have caught the error.""We have protections in place,""Latimer said, according to the Tampa Bay Times. ""Once a voter has cast their ballot, we mark that on their record, so they would be unable to vote a second time. This is due to a clerical error and affected 252 voters only in Pinellas County ... There is no reason for people to be worried about security.""However, City Clerk Diana Bruner feels that the city ""dropped the ball"". Bruner said that they [the city] did not follow procedure when it came to the annexation ordinance.The Tampa Bay Times reported that Bruner said, ""We have a system. ... It usually gets distributed to the supervisor of elections, the tax collector, the property appraiser, the 911 center and even a couple of state agencies,"" she said. ""Somewhere we broke down and it didn't get done.""This mishap is the latest problem plaguing Florida's elections. Last week the United States District Judge Mark Walker, a President Obama nominee, ruled that the voter registration deadline had to be extended due to Hurricane Matthew. Following that decision, Walker also ruled that the state must provide a method for voters to fix signature problems on mail-in ballots before the election.SIGN UP"	['Obama']	[]

Tim Kaine of Virginia, however, claimed Thursday that reserving his ""right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result"" was contrary to American political tradition, despite her own vigorous support for Al Gore's exercise of that right in the contested 2000 Presidential election.As the New York Times reported Thursday:But Mrs. Clinton and her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, both said Mr. Trump's defiant comments were far beyond the political mainstream. Mrs. Clinton, who called Mr. Trump's remarks ""horrifying"" during the debate, repeated that criticism on board her campaign plane in Las Vegas, and said Mr. Trump was bucking centuries of American tradition.""We are a country based on laws, and we've had hot, contested elections going back to the very beginning,"" Mrs. Clinton told reporters. ""But one of our hallmarks has always been that we accept the outcomes of our election.""Mr. Kaine went further in a series of television interviews, saying Mr. Trump was trying to take down a ""central pillar"" of the political system because he is on track for defeat.Mr. Kaine said he hoped voters would give the Democratic ticket ""a mandate"" in the election so that Mr. Trump cannot cast doubt on the outcome.At the third and final presidential debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday, debate moderator Chris Wallace asked Trump, ""Do you make the same commitment that you will absolutely -- sir, that you will absolutely accept the result of this election?""""I will look at it at the time. I'm not looking at anything now. I'll look at it at the time,"" Trump responded.""What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense. OK?"" the GOP nominee added.Media pundits have declared that Donald Trump's answer to Chris Wallace's question at Wednesday's third and final presidential debate about accepting the results of the 2016 presidential election was ""a major mistake.""Hillary Clinton supporters agree with the media pundits, while Donald Trump supporters disagree.Early returns from two focus groups of  the all-important undecided voters suggest they disagree with the media pundits.By a 10 to 5 margin, a CNN focus group of undecided voters said Trump won the debate. A Frank Luntz focus group of Nevada undecided voters said that Trump won by a 14 to 12 margin.The media appear to be in lock-stop, using Hillary Clinton's talking points that Trump's answer represented a dangerous threat to our democratic traditions.But Trump's response, though he did not specifically use that term, was all about the rule of law.Rather than accept an unfavorable outcome, as initially reported on election night, as Richard Nixon did when he conceded in the razor-thin presidential election of 1960 to John F. Kennedy, Trump simply said he would keep his options open-exactly what Democrat Al Gore did in 2000, when he withdrew his election night concession to George W. Bush and challenged the election results for more than a month until the famous Bush v. Gore decision was handed down by the Supreme Court of the United States.Dan Balz at the Washington Post, now owned by Amazon's Jeff Bezos, wrote of Trump's debate night response:Asked directly by moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News whether, if he lost, he would accept the outcome of the election as legitimate, he hedged. He would decide at the time, he would ""keep you in suspense."" It was, as Wallace suggested, an unprecedented departure in the history of the country. It was also a major mistake. Yet Trump seemed not to care at all.Brit Hume began his post-debate analysis on Fox News by declaring:The headline out of this debate as far as I can tell is his refusal to say he would accept the results of the election.That doesn't happen in America. It's newsworthy, it's controversial, it is a big deal, and so the question is that something that will help him? I doubt it.""This was his best performance to date,"" Hume added. ""I think he stepped on it by refusing to say he would accept the results of the election,"" he concludedHume's colleague at Fox News, former Walter Mondale speechwriter Charles Krauthammer, called Trump's response ""political suicide.""Tim Alberta and Eliana Johnson, writing at the NeverTrump National Review made the same point:But any points Trump might have scored down the debate's home stretch were negated when Wallace broached the topic Trump has hammered in recent days: a ""rigged election."" The Republican nominee refused to say he would accept the results on November 8, promising only that he would examine them ""at the time."" When Wallace reminded Trump of America's tradition of peaceful transitions of power, and pressed for a more specific answer, Trump replied: ""I'll keep you in suspense."" At that point, Clinton chimed in to underline the moment: ""That's horrifying.""Several media outlets reporting on Trump's speech in Newark, Ohio Thursday blared a headline saying Trump would accept the outcome of the election if he won, but buried his statement that he would accept a clear electoral result, while reserving the right to challenge a contested result far down in their stories.Here's the full transcript of the question and answer from Wednesday's third and final presidential debate, followed by Hillary Clinton's response:WALLACE: Mr. Trump, I want to ask you about one last question in this topic. You have been warning at rallies recently that this election is rigged and that Hillary Clinton is in the process of trying to steal it from you.Your running mate, Governor Pence, pledged on Sunday that he and you -- his words -- ""will absolutely accept the result of this election.""

I want to ask you here on the stage tonight: Do you make the same commitment that you will absolutely -- sir, that you will absolutely accept the result of this election?TRUMP: I will look at it at the time. I'm not looking at anything now. I'll look at it at the time.What I've seen -- what I've seen is so bad. First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt, and the pile-on is so amazing. The New York Times actually wrote an article about it, but they don't even care. It's so dishonest. And they've poisoned the mind of the voters.But unfortunately for them, I think the voters are seeing through it. I think they're going to see through it. We'll find out on November 8th. But I think they're going to see through it.WALLACE: But, sir, there's...TRUMP: If you look -- excuse me, Chris -- if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote -- millions, this isn't coming from me -- this is coming from Pew Report and other places -- millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote.So let me just give you one other thing.

OK?""Well, Chris, let me respond to that, because that's horrifying.

We've had free and fair elections. We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them. And that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election.

He is denigrating -- he's talking down our democracy. And I, for one, am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position.TRUMP: I think what the FBI did and what the Department of Justice did, including meeting with her husband, the attorney general, in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in Arizona, I think it's disgraceful.

I have really been trying to figure this out-my whole life, you know? It is time for him to step up to the plate,"" said Danney Williams, 30, who traveled from his Arkansas home to Las Vegas for Wednesday's third presidential debate between GOP nominee Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton.The Arkansas man is not trolling the Democratic nominee's husband. He said he is formally requesting that the former president submit to a paternity test and put the matter to rest-once and for all.""It is up to him now, "" he said.""I've proven who I am, let him step up and prove me right or prove me wrong,"" he said.Williams' mother, Bobbie Ann Williams, is quoted in media accounts describing how, as a prostitute in Little Rock, the then-governor met her while out on a jog. The two became close and shared several intimate encounters, according to those accounts.After Williams was born, his mother allegedly told the governor about his son and although Clinton was reluctant, she said in interviews, Arkansas state troopers would pay her child support every month with seven $100 bills.The payments stopped however after he announced Clinton was running for president, according to her media accounts.Williams said he has a good relationship with his mother.""My mom? She's been consistent about how she met him and how he's my father-she believes in her heart without a doubt that he is my father,"" Williams, a construction worker, said.""But, it's hard,"" Williams said.""It's hard for her to talk about it now, because of the guilt about how we come up, house-to-house and right? She couldn't provide for us and we didn't have father in our lives,"" he said.Williams said it makes him proud that his mother is proud of him and the man that he has become, but all sons need to hear from their fathers that their own father is proud of them, too.In addition to working construction, Williams said he pumped gas and worked other jobs, sometimes three at a time to provide for his own children as best he could.Now that he is a father, Williams said he cannot understand why his own father does not want to be a part of his life.""Raising my own kids, they all have their own personalities, "" he said. ""You go through the pain and hurt with them, you cry with them and they want to know who my father is and I want them to know.""""I promised my own kids I would always love them and be there for them,"" he said. ""When you don't have a relationship with your father it isn't right. It messes with you and you feel guilty about it-and now my children want to have a relationship with their grandfather.""While the woman he claims as his half-sister, Chelsea Clinton, grew up in the White House like a princess called the First Daughter, Williams said he struggled.""Back in '95, I was in school and he was the president, there were times I would be seeing him on TV-and it just hurt,"" he said.""I just really wanted to know-and it felt horrible because I knew his child Chelsea was well taken care of-and me? Hungry at night and knowing, who my father is, you know that hurts,"" he said.His mother, who battled substance abuse, went to prison and he was raised by his mother's sister and also spent time in Arkansas's foster care program, he said.""I was going house-to-house, I mean my mom was still in the streets and my aunt was trying to raise me-and not only me, I have three little siblings, too-so, it was a struggle, but I am blessed to still be here today and state the true facts of who I am,"" he said.Williams said there were times when he knew he got through to the president.""Yeah, I know he knows,"" he said.""Back in 2013, 2014, I was emailing him. I had to email him through Facebook, but then, I got blocked from his Facebook.""At another time, in February, Williams said he received an email from a man claiming to be a friend of the president.The man, who Williams does not want to name, told him that Clinton knew all about it.""He said if I wanted to meet with my father, he could arrange it, but my father did not want any publicity,"" Williams said.""Nothing ever came of it, I think somebody just wanted to feel me out, see what I was doing, if I was still saying what I had been saying,"" he said.Now, Williams is taking control of his own narrative and his own quest to be recognized as the son of the 42th president.SIGN UP"	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Williams']	[]

Yet despite the influx of Clinton bots, who managed to skew the poll into suggesting Clinton had a 6-point lead, Trump has since overtaken her, regaining an 8-point lead in a poll of nearly 300,000 people (and bots.)When only taking into account votes from American IP addresses, Trump has a lead of 71 per cent to Clinton's 29 per cent.Polling from across the night has so far proved inconclusive. A Washington Post debate poll suggested Trump won the debate 77 per cent thought he was the winner compared to 17 percent who believed the winner was Clinton, whilst a Drudge poll delivered a result of 75 per cent to 25 per cent in favour of Trump.The Washington Times Presidential Debate Poll:TRUMP 77% (18,290)CLINTON 17% (4,100)#DrainTheSwamp #Debate pic.twitter.com/wsgsf5nv6H-- Donald J.

And she says that's true tonight before saying this election will be over soon.9:27: Clinton says Trump looks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a ""4"" or perhaps a ""5."" Clinton says she's now known for her sense of humor and that's why it took a village to write her jokes. Clinton jokes she's the life of every party she has attended and she's been to three. She says when the party gets out of hand, it's imperative to have a responsible chaperone to get everyone home safely, and that's why she picked Tim Kaine. Clinton says it's smart there's no Teleprompter because you saw Trump dismantle his. She jokes it's harder when you're translating from the original Russian.9:25: Clinton jokes about the dinner bringing together bitter foes and asks how de Blasio and Cuomo were able to get together. She makes a ""basket of adorables"" joke. Clinton says Trump should feel free to shout ""wrong"" whenever she is talking. Clinton says it's amazing she is speaking after Donald because she didn't think he would be okay with a ""peaceful transition of power."" She says after listening to his speech, she will enjoy listening to Pence deny he ever gave it.9:21: After Trump gets booed, Clinton now goes to the podium. She says this is such a special event that she took a break from her ""rigorous nap schedule"" to be here. She says it's a treat because usually she charges a lot for speeches like this. Clinton talks about the ""fiery populist"" Al Smith and says he would be very proud of how much money they've raised for needy children. She says if he saw this room full of plutocrats celebrating his legacy, he would be very confused. Clinton also jokes that she may not be eligible for Sainthood but getting through three debates with Trump has to count for a miracle.9:15: Trump says Clinton isn't laughing much tonight because she knows all of the jokes, which were given in advance to her by Donna Brazile. Trump also swipes Clinton for protecting to like Catholics and says Clinton knows ""it takes a village"" and has taken a number of them in Haiti. Trump says he wants to say something nice about Clinton. He says Clinton has been in Washington a long time and knows a lot about how government works. He says according to her sworn testimony, Clinton has forgotten more about government than most of us even know.9:12: Trump also takes a dig at the mainstream press. He also says that the media is so biased because everyone loves Michelle Obama's speech but when Melania delivers the same speech, everyone gets on her case. Trump says Hillary is so corrupt that she got kicked off the Watergate Commission. ""How corrupt do you have to be to kicked off the Watergate Commission?"" he says. Trump says Clinton has been in politics since the 70s and her pitch is the economy is busted and the government is corrupt. Trump says he wasn't sure Hillary was going to be here tonight because ""you didn't send her invitations by email.""There's also this sense that Trump is surprised at the words he's reciting...asif he's never seen the before. (""true! true!"")-- Jeff Greenfield (@greenfield64) October 21, 20169:10: Trump said he called Hillary a ""nasty woman"" last night and after Clinton rattled on and on and on, he doesn't think badly of Rosie O'Donnell anymore.Trump: ""This is the first time ever that Hillary is sitting down with major corporate leaders and not getting paid for it.""-- Roger Simon (@politicoroger) October 21, 20169:09: Trump makes hilarious joke about civility. He says Hillary bumped into him and said, ""pardon me."" Trump says he told her he would talk about it after he gets into office. Trump says Hillary said he would want Trump to be her Ambassador to Iraq or Afghanistan.9:07: Trump makes a joke about how he was a ""carpenter working for his father."" He says what's great about the Al Smith Dinner is that even in the rough and tumble world of politics, the candidates are able to have some lighthearted moments.9:05: Trump gives a ""special hello"" to all in the room who have ""known and loved me for many years."" He says the politicians have asked for his endorsement and always wanted his money. He says when he ran for president as a Republican, they said he is a ""no-good, rotten, disgusting scoundrel."" Trump says people thought he may have trouble with self-deprecating jokes. And he says many have think modesty is his best quality, perhaps next to his temperament. Trump says Cardinal Dolan's property is much more impressive because Trump built his with his beautifully-formed hands while his was built with the hands of God. ""No contest,"" he says.Trump on @senschumer:  ""He used to love me when I was a Democrat""-- Jennifer Epstein (@jeneps) October 21, 20169:03: Trump takes the stage after much ribbing and says, ""that was good.""

""We must mobilize, rebuild and expand services -- or the human and economic burden will continue to grow.""More than 1.5 million people reported cases of chlamydia last year. Young adults, ages 15 to 24, accounted for nearly two-thirds of the reported chlamydia.

About half of the nearly 20 million new STD cases reported every year are among 15 to 24-year-olds.The report also found an increase in syphilis rates among newborns.""The health outcomes of syphilis -- miscarriage, stillbirth, blindness or stroke -- can be devastating,"" Dr. Gail Bolan, director of CDC's Division of STD Prevention, said. She went on to say:The resurgence of congenital syphilis and the increasing impact of syphilis among gay and bisexual men makes it clear that many Americans are not getting the preventive services they need. Every pregnant woman should be tested for syphilis, and sexually active gay and bisexual men should be tested for syphilis at least once a year. To reverse the STD epidemic, we should all learn to talk more openly about STDs -- with our partners, parents, and providers.""It is my hope that a decade from now, we will be reporting on progress, instead of more health inequity in our society,"" Bolan wrote.Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudsonThe resurgence of congenital syphilis and the increasing impact of syphilis among gay and bisexual men makes it clear that many Americans are not getting the preventive services they need.

Campbell merely touched her accidentally, as his attorney had claimed all along.Originally, Harris told local ABC News affiliate WLOS, ""He stopped in his tracks, and he turned around and just cold-cocked me."" She also added a pointed, rhetorical question -- namely, whether ""people find a Trump supporter punching her in the face deplorable.""Now, however, Teter is changing her story rather dramatically. She told WLOS on Wednesday that ""it's possible that he could have struck her with his backhand.""O'Keefe's undercover video showed Democracy Partners consultant Scott Foval -- who has since been fired -- claiming that Teeter was a ""trained"" political activist.WLOS reports that Teter ""vehemently denied being involved in any way with any person, group, or organization, political or otherwise."" She did admit having volunteered on Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.As a result of Teter's initial accusation, police in Asheville issued a warrant for Campbell's arrest, and his name was dragged through the mud nationwide -- for the simple act of attending a political rally.Facebook video of the altercation shows Campbell -- who suffers poor vision as a result of cataracts -- being led through a gauntlet of anti-Trump protesters by his wife.In the video, Teter then follows Campbell and appears to reach for his shoulder. His attorney told Breitbart News that he turned around after being touched, and Teeter then fell down.She showed no visible sign of injury to her face in photographs and interviews that followed the incident.Democracy Partners co-founder Robert Creamer has resigned from his work with the Hillary Clinton campaign as a result of O'Keefe's expose.The spelling of Shirley Teter's name has been corrected.Joel B.

I have an entire chapter in my book In Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome! quoting media savants complaining about Trump's lack of ""policy specifics,"" interspersed, by date, with his major policy speeches and papers.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAt this point, the only ""policy specific"" Trump hasn't given us is which company will supply rebar for the wall.But now, the media's entire campaign against Trump is to prevent him from talking about policy. They would rather talk about fat-shaming than trade, immigration and jobs.Sometimes, it seems like Trump is cheating by taking the vastly more popular side of every issue.The official GOP used to send its candidates out with ankle weights, a 75-pound backpack and blinders. But Trump didn't agree to take any staggeringly unpopular positions, however much the Business Roundtable loved them.He's against amnesty, for building a wall, against the Trans-Pacific Partnership, for Social Security, against the Iraq War and for extreme vetting of Muslim immigrants.That's why the media have to change the subject to something flashy that will capture the attention of the most down-market, easily fooled voters. Trump is a groper!The media's interest in sex scandals goes back and forth, depending on their needs at the moment. When the last name of the perp is ""Kennedy"" or ""Clinton,"" they're not interested. When it's ""the Duke lacrosse team"": Guilty.The fact that a lacrosse team at an elite college had hired a couple of strippers, who -- THANK GOD ALMIGHTY -- turned out to be black, was all the evidence our media needed to conclude that the athletes had committed a gang-rape, based on centuries of entitlement.By contrast, when former U.S. senator John Edwards was cheating on his dying wife -- while he was running for president, paying his mistress with campaign funds and lying to the American people about it, between lecturing us about morality with the unctuous sanctimony that passes for policy in the Democratic Party -- the media primly refused to cover it.That is, until Edwards was out of the race, at which point the media refused to cover it because he wasn't a candidate. (You guys are the best! I love the media.)For more than a year, the National Enquirer had the entire Edwards story to itself. Finally, its reporters chased Edwards into a hotel bathroom at 2:40 in the morning, after having caught him spending the evening with his mistress and their love-child at the Beverly Hilton.At that moment, when the affair was plastered in photos all over the Enquirer, Los Angeles Times editor Tony Pierce emailed his bloggers, instructing them not to mention the ""alleged affair,"" explaining, ""We have decided not to cover the rumors or salacious speculations,"" since ""the only source has been the National Enquirer"" -- he might have added, ""a vastly more interesting and accurate publication than the L.A. Times.""A few years passed, and suddenly we were back to Duke lacrosse standards of proof. As a rule of thumb, the only sex stories our media believe are the false ones.Emma Sulkowicz, or ""Mattress Girl,"" claimed she had been raped by a fellow student at Columbia University and that college administrators refused to take action against her rapist.Columbia, to refresh your memory, is the institution that invited Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to speak. University administrators are constantly changing mascot names and canceling traditional celebrations because some feminist yelps.But, somehow, Mattress Girl's claim that administrators at Columbia turned a deaf ear to her brutal rape was completely believable to our media and political class. You could see the corporate recruiters lining up!Among the many, many articles in The New York Times about brave Mattress Girl, art and culture writer Roberta Smith said her art project -- carrying a mattress around campus to symbolize the weight carried by rape victims -- raised ""analogies"" to Christ's Stations of the Cross (especially to writers at the Times, where not a minute goes by without their thinking about the Passion).Mattress Girl made the Times' ""Quotation of the Day"" for this humdinger: ""I've never felt more shoved under the rug in my life.""Even as the charges were unraveling, easily fooled U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand brought Mattress Girl as her special guest to President Obama's State of the Union address. (If only Clinton had known it was possible to invite girls with mattresses to the State of the Union!)After Mattress Girl had spent a couple of years accepting awards, her alleged rapist finally released her texts to him, both before and after the alleged rape.Here are a few from before the alleged rape:""f**k me in the butt""""I love youuuu""And here are a few after:""I wanna see yoyououoyou""""I love you Paul. Where are you?!?!?!?!""Unlike Trump's secretly recorded hot-mic conversation 11 years ago, the Times never thought it worthwhile to quote any of Sulkowicz's messages to Paul -- much less on its front page, sans asterisks. The closest the Times came to acknowledging these texts was to delicately note that the two had ""traded mutually affectionate messages.""Continuing the media's winning streak, about the same time as Mattress Girl was sitting for her Smithsonian portrait, Rolling Stone's Sabrina Rubin Erdely was all over the news, reaping accolades for a story about a gang-rape at the University of Virginia even more preposterous than the Duke lacrosse case.Sadly for the media, the victim wasn't black. But, on the other hand, the alleged perps were ""frat boys."" (As far as our media are concerned, the lowest circle of hell is reserved for ""frat boys."")Erdely was the toast of the town ... until a few weeks later, when her story completely fell apart. Rolling Stone retracted the article, the Columbia Journalism Review investigated, and there are currently three defamation lawsuits proceeding against the magazine.Now, the same people who brought us the Duke lacrosse case, Mattress Girl and the Rolling Stone abomination -- but who discreetly left John Edwards' sex scandal to the National Enquirer; Bill Clinton's serial sexual assaults to private litigant Paula Jones; and the Kennedy family's whoring to investigative journalists Seymour Hersh (30 years later) and Leo Damore (20 years later) -- these are the people who tell us they're pretty sure Donald Trump is a groper.Three weeks before a major presidential election.Trump has been a rich celebrity for 40 years, employing thousands of women, but this is the first time he has been seriously accused of any sexual impropriety. You will recall that, just this May, The New York Times conducted a major investigation into Trump's treatment of women -- and came up empty-handed.Trump denies the allegations, but don't expect a ""Correction"" like this one from the Chicago Tribune, dated Sept. 5, 1996: ""In her Wednesday Commentary page column, Linda Bowles stated that President Clinton and the former campaign adviser Dick Morris both were 'guilty of callous unfaithfulness to their wives and children.' Neither man has admitted to being or been proven to have been unfaithful. The Tribune regrets the error.""Strangely, the allegations against Trump don't even tell a larger story about the (apocryphal) ""campus rape culture."" Trump's not a member of the Duke lacrosse team. He isn't a ""frat boy.""The only reason for these 11th-hour claims is that the ruling class doesn't want voters thinking about the immigration policies, trade deals and wars that are destroying their way of life. Ever since Trump started raising the issues that no one else would, the media and the political class have done everything in their power to try to stop our movement.They're so close! Just four more years of importing the Third World at breakneck speed, and America will be O-ver.Maybe it will work. And then six months after the election, Americans will realize they've been scammed by the media into giving away their country.SIGN UP"	['Trump', 'Paul', 'Clinton', 'Gillibrand', 'Kennedy']	['god']

Sessions: Obama Keeps 182,761 Convicted Foreign Criminals in United States	"Roughly 180,000 foreign criminals with court-approved removal orders are still living in the United States because President Barack Obama's administration is not trying to send them home, says a new Senate report.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAlabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions hit the administration Wednesday for allowing other countries to treat the United States as a holding ground for their migrant criminals.Agencies working for Obama have allowed almost 1 million illegal immigrants to remain in the country, even though they have been approved by judges for deportation. That number includes 182,761 illegal aliens who have been convicted of crimes inside the United States.The one million total also includes almost one-quarter of a million illegal aliens whose home countries simply refuse to let U.S. officials fly the criminals home.Obama's deputies could pressure those countries to take back their criminals, for example, by denying visas to political and business leaders from those countries. So far, the U.S. has only applied those pressures to the small nation of Gambia.""According to data provided to the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), as of June 25, 2016, there were 953,806 aliens in the United States with outstanding orders of removal, 182,761 of whom were convicted of crimes in the United States,"" Sessions' office stated.""Of the 953,806 aliens who have final orders of removal, 242,772 come from countries that refuse to take back their nationals after they receive final removal orders,"" said the statement.Of the quarter million aliens, ""123,098 [are] coming from the 23 countries that ICE deems to be 'recalcitrant,' and 119,674 from the 62 countries that ICE deems to be otherwise uncooperative.""Tens of thousands of those 242,722 illegal aliens went on to commit more crimes after being released back onto U.S. soil, says the Sessions statement.""57,029 were convicted of criminal offenses, or roughly 30 percent of the criminal aliens with removal orders in the United States--including 28,733 from Cuba, 7,705 from Vietnam, 2,140 from Haiti, and 1,848 from China,"" his office continued.Lax immigration enforcement has allowed much crime by non-departed aliens, including murders.[I]n 2012, ICE released an alien who had completed his sentence for attempted murder instead of deporting him to Haiti, because Haiti refused to accept him. In 2015, the same alien stabbed 25-year-old Casey Chadwick of Norwich, Connecticut, before stuffing her body in a closet.  In 2013, an alien who should have been deported to Cambodia in 2009, but was instead released from ICE custody, molested a child that he picked up from a school without authorization.  And in 2010, an alien who should have been deported to Jamaica, but was instead released, broke into his ex-girlfriend's home and stabbed her and a friend as her children slept nearby.Many criminal aliens are now being released from U.S. jails back into U.S. neighborhoods, instead of being repatriated, the statement says.Further, 95 of these dangerous criminal aliens were recently released early from federal prison, due to retroactive sentence reductions, and not deported, including:A Cuban national with convictions for burglary, drug trafficking, and sex offenses, who was released in Florida;A Cuban national with convictions for eight counts of assault and aggravated assault, along with convictions for battery, selling cocaine, six counts of larceny, and four additional charges related to stolen property, who was released in Texas;A Laotian national with convictions for burglary, drug trafficking, homicide, and sexual assault, who was released in California; and,A Syrian national with convictions for selling cocaine and possession of a weapon, who was released in Illinois.China and Cuba each have resisted taking back tens of thousands of their citizens wreaking havoc in the U.S., with Brazil and Haiti close behind: The only country who experienced repercussions for refusing to take back their criminal citizens was Gambia, who made up less than one percent of the some-quarter million ready to go back if their home countries would allow them. Gambian government employees and their families can no longer receive U.S. visas, a repercussions Sessions called ""mild"" and unlikely to work.The Obama administration also granted U.S. citizenship to over 1,800 illegal aliens from terrorist-infiltrated countries who were set for deportation. Once the massive fraud and security crisis was exposed, the administration shut down the whistleblower program that uncovered it.[I]n 2012, ICE released an alien who had completed his sentence for attempted murder instead of deporting him to Haiti, because Haiti refused to accept him.

But neither did she.The media, of course, will focus on his refusal to say whether he will accept the outcome of an election that has yet to come.Of course not a single actual human being cares about such nonsense but this is what electrifies the stammering media.Or they will focus on his comment about what a nasty woman Hillary Clinton is.

But no biggie.The truth is, Mr. Trump is at his absolute pure best when he is on the attack, prosecuting the case against Mrs. Clinton, talking directly to her. He is animated. He is clear. He is fierce.Unfortunately, he confronted her only a handful of times Wednesday night.From this moment to the end of the election, Mr. Trump needs to wake up every day and go out and pretend he is talking to Mrs. Clinton, calling her a liar, accusing her of rampant corruption, hammering her for disdain for America and all Americans.If he can keep that up, orange just might pay off.
