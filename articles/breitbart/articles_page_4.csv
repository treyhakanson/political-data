The app benefits from a partnership with TSC Targets and ""has signed 100 contracts with bricks-and-mortar shooting ranges to carry TSC Targets in-store."" The app designers also ""secured online retail distribution of TSC Targets through Amazon with free shipping for Prime members.""The goal goes beyond mere target shooting to actually envelope a ""social network for guns.""

""So the word is out that he has not paid any taxes for 10 years. Let him prove he has paid taxes because he has not,"" Reid claimed.Reid never revealed his source or proved his allegation, which turned out to be false, outside of the Senate.

They have arrested a Rockford man now accused of the child's murder.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERPolice arrested Kamel Harris, 41, for the death of two-year-old Kyrian Knox, whose remains were found in Garfield Park lagoon during Labor Day weekend in 2015.Investigators say that Harris committed the murder because the lactose intolerant child was crying and would not stop after having a bad reaction to the milk he was fed. ""He kind of just snapped and couldn't deal with it anymore,"" Chicago Police Commander Kevin Duffin said at a Tuesday news conference.""We promised we'd never give up on him and we haven't,"" the CPD said of the year-long investigation into the death.The Rockford resident was charged with first-degree murder, felony concealment of a homicidal death, and felony dismemberment of a human body.At the time of the murder, the child's mother, Lanisha Knox, was moving to another state and reportedly left the boy with Harris to care for while she moved. Harris was a family friend. Knox professed her satisfaction with the arrest of Harris and noted she was grateful that the CPD did not give up on solving the crime.Harris initially reported that the boy had been kidnapped from his care, but eventually, investigators discovered remnants of the boy's blood in the suspect's car.After finding the child's body parts in the lagoon, Chicago Marine Unit Sgt. Angel Romero said the case was a tough one.""It was pretty difficult to deal with,"" Romero told the media.

Tim Ryan said Thursday he will challenge Rep. Nancy Pelosi as House minority leader, shaking up the Democratic leadership race after the party's electoral shellacking.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""What we are doing right now is not working,"" the 43-year-old Ryan said in a letter. ""Under our current leadership, Democrats have been reduced to our smallest congressional minority since 1929. This should indicate to all of us that keeping our leadership team completely unchanged will simply lead to more disappointment in future elections.""Pelosi, well-known for her ability to count votes, said in announcing her candidacy on Wednesday that she has the backing of two-thirds of the caucus. Ryan dismissed that claim as disgruntled Democrats clamor for change after losing the White House and remaining in the minority in the House and Senate with minimal gains.The election is slated for Nov. 30. It marks the second time Pelosi has faced a challenge after a dismal Democratic performance in an election.In a closed-door session earlier Thursday, Rep. Kathleen Rice, D-N.Y., said she told her colleagues that ""if we don't, as a party, have our leaders accept responsibility for where we are, we can't move forward and get to the point where our message is going to resonate with voters.""Pelosi, 76, is a survivor who enjoys enormous respect and goodwill among most Democrats, even as many of her closest allies have left Congress. She has managed to maintain unity within the diverse flock of House Democrats and is an unparalleled fundraiser for them, collecting more than $100 million in the past cycle alone.She was crucial in ensuring President Barack Obama's health care overhaul became law in 2010. Even in the minority under Obama, Pelosi has been a savvy negotiator with GOP leaders when Democratic votes were needed to advance legislation.The first female speaker of the House, Pelosi has led House Democrats since 2002.""When somebody challenges you, your supporters turn out, both internally in the caucus and in the country,"" Pelosi told reporters at her weekly news conference.Some Democratic lawmakers expressed their frustration in the closed-door session, and some grew angrier after Pelosi left the room to hold her weekly news conference, according to those who attended the session and spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss the session.Among the frustrations for junior Democrats is that several top Democrats on powerful committees have been atop their posts for many years - well into their 80s in some cases - and are not some of the party's most vibrant voices. For instance, the top Democrat on the panel responsible for taxes and the Affordable Care Act is 85-year-old Michigan Rep. Sander Levin, while the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee is John Conyers, 87, who's been in Congress for more than 50 years.""We've got a couple of big issues coming up, not the least of which is defending the very strong parts of the Affordable Care Act,"" said Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., a rival of Levin's on the powerful panel.Some Democrats are pressing for term limits for committee chairmen. Pelosi didn't dismiss the idea.""If you want that, you have to fight for it,' Pelosi said.In the meeting, Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., said he issued a challenge in the caucus ""that anybody who is running for any position of leadership needs to come back and explain to us how we're going to be able to survive one, the Trump years, but two, to not have the same excuse we have every two years where there's some external factor that somehow causes us to not gain the seats that we need.""The elections had been scheduled for Thursday but were postponed until after Thanksgiving.On the budget front, House Republican leaders said President-elect Donald Trump wants a short-term spending bill to keep the government running through March of next year.The current stopgap spending bill runs out in less than a month, on Dec. 9. House and Senate negotiators are working on a bill they could pass before leaving for the holidays.House Republicans met Thursday behind closed doors with Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Speaker Paul Ryan told them the new administration prefers a four-month extension of spending.Such a move would let the Republican-controlled government boost military spending next year while trying to cut domestic programs, but it would require cooperation from Democrats in the Senate.SIGN UP"

The district court order brings the state into compliance with this federal rule and ensures the department may provide this service to Minnesotans,"" the agency said in a statement.Thomas will now be allowed to have his double mastectomy this month, in addition to the counseling and hormone therapy he has undergone to transition into a man.""I'm so happy we won,"" he said. ""The judge's ruling is a forceful statement that transgender people deserve equal treatment under the law.""President Obama tried to make it legal for transgenders to use whatever bathrooms they choose, but a federal judge struck down his directive in August.SIGN UP"

""In so doing, that individual would become an agent for an agenda that both contradicts progressive values and threatens grave harm to our nation's most vulnerable kids.""He continues:The policies and rhetoric of President-elect Trump run contrary to the most fundamental values of what it means to be a progressive committed to educating our kids and strengthening our families and communities. He proposes to eliminate accountability standards, cut Title I funding, and to gut support for vital social services that maximize our students' ability to reach their potential. And, most pernicious, Trump gives both tacit and express endorsement to a dangerous set of racial, ethnic, religious, and gender stereotypes that assault the basic dignity of our children, causing incalculable harm not only to their sense of self, but also to their sense of belonging as accepted members of school communities and neighborhoods.""For these reasons, no Democrat should accept appointment as Secretary of Education, unless and until President-elect Trump disavows his prior statements and commits to educating the whole child and supporting the communities and families they depend on,"" Jeffries says.While on the campaign trail, Trump said he will be ""the biggest cheerleader for school choice"" and spend $20 billion to establish a block grant to fund school choice for children living in low-income areas.Public schools are ""our government-run monopoly"" that has ""trapped millions of African-American and Hispanic youth in failing government schools that deny them the opportunity to join the ladder of American success,"" Trump said in a speech in September, adding:I want every single inner city child in America who is today trapped in a failing school to have the freedom - the civil right - to attend the school of their choice.

The comments led the U.S. Secret Service to interview him for two hours at his Del Mar, California home.The night of the November 8, 2016 presidential election, Harrigan posted several threatening messages to his personal Facebook page: ""I'm going to kill the president.

""Number one, you're not a public safety risk by blocking and obstructing your vision while on the road, but also that you're identifiable to law enforcement.""The new language would read:A person is guilty of a misdemeanor when he or she wears a mask, hood, or device by which any portion of the face is so hidden, concealed or covered as to conceal the identity of the wearer and is upon any public way or public property or upon the private property of another without the written permission of the owner or occupier of the property to do so.The bill goes on to state, ""For the purposes of this subsection, the phrase 'upon any public way or property' includes but is not limited to operating a motor vehicle upon any public street, road, or highway.""The issue of wearing a Muslim veil or burqa has been contentious in several states. Several years ago, a Muslim woman took the Florida Department of Motor Vehicles to court to force it to allow her to wear a burqa for her license photo. A judge denied her request.In another case, the Illinois Secretary of State's office issued a ruling that was initially interpreted as allowing women to wear full face coverings in license photos.

Mitt Romney. According to the flawed exit polls, he was supported by one-in-sex African-American men nationwide.This may come as a shock to the political left, but not everyone who opposed Donald Trump is as angry or despondent as the demonstrators who grabbed headlines nationwide over the past week or the pundits who intellectualized the Democratic hissy fit.On Monday I took a stroll around New York City's Harlem neighborhood ...""Hillary wasn't strong enough. She didn't fight enough,"" said a gentleman leaving a drugstore, who introduced himself as Pace. ""People saw her as weak and thought she'd be weak in the White House."" He also faulted Mrs. Clinton's message. ""She was talking about what she did in other countries as secretary of state. I can understand the situation around the world, but we live here."" Mr. Trump, in contrast, ""was talking about the people who live here--the poor, the veterans.""...Derrick, an off-duty police officer, told me that he considers Mr. Trump a con artist who tricked people into voting for him and won't come through, especially on his promise to bring back manufacturing jobs. ""But I'll give him this,"" he said. ""She was not talking about securing this country, and that's what he was talking about. People are watching people get blown up by these terrorists, and they're scared, and she was talking about an open border. She didn't emphasize scrutinizing the people who are coming in, and he did.""On Nov. 8, Trump got perhaps 10 percent of the African-American vote. Many fewer African-Americans turned out to vote against him than voted against Romney in 2012.If Trump can follow through on his 2016 campaign promises -- such as controlling the border, curbing drugs, reducing crime -- any subsequent shift in African-American voting would have a huge impact on American politics. For example, if Trump bumps his African-American support up to just 20 percent, he gains an extra three percentage points over any Democratic candidate.Read it all here:
