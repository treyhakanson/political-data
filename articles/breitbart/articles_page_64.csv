In addition, O'Keefe and his team show how the Hillary Clinton campaign is coordinating with super PACs through text messages, using consultants as intermediaries -- the ""Pony Express.""SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe campaign and its functionaries hid their efforts using a ""double-blind"" system to allow ""plausible deniability"" if their plans went awry. And they used the media to spread a carefully crafted message that ""Trump is dangerous and divisive, undermining our values and putting our security at risk,"" as one Democratic National Committee (DNC) PowerPoint presentation, revealed by Wikileaks, put it.Hillary Clinton and her secretive campaign apparatus are deliberately turning Americans against each other, using violence that has spread beyond their control and that has led to attacks on innocent people at Trump rallies -- for which elected Democrats and the mainstream media blame Donald Trump, regardless.The entire scheme is managed by Robert Creamer -- a veteran Chicago activist and organizer who was convicted and sentenced to federal prison in 2006-7, but who trained volunteers in the Obama campaign and who remains crucial to Democrats' messaging efforts. His group, Democracy Partners, is the ""pinwheel"" through which the party funnels resources that are used by super PACs and others.Creamer's various protests and provocations are known to the DNC, with Hillary Clinton approving at least one effort, featuring a provocateur in a ""Donald Duck"" costume. A recent Wikileaks email release also showed that Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, had approved a plan for ""bird-dogging"" Trump by inserting immigration activists, including illegal aliens, into his rallies to confront him.Hillary Clinton said at the second presidential debate that she wanted to ""overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another."" She and her campaign are responsible for that divisiveness -- to the point of inciting violence.O'Keefe and Project Veritas have bravely uncovered the corrupt, destructive machine at the heart of Democrats' effort to elect Hillary Clinton at any cost. Their work leaves no doubt as to which candidate is really dividing America.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Campbell, the man accused of punching a protester outside a Donald Trump rally in Asheville, North Carolina, last month tells Breitbart News that a new video produced by James O'Keefe's Project Veritas showing a Democratic consultant claiming responsibility for the incident should exonerate her client.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""Mr. Campbell never assaulted anyone,"" attorney Ruth Smith told Breitbart News via e-mail. ""He went to a political rally as was his Constitutional right.""As a result of Ms. Teter's hoax, he and his wife have been tarred and feathered in the media and he has been charged as a criminal. It's disgusting that people would do this sort of thing to innocent people, and worse that they seem to make a sport out of it.""Campbell, 73, was accused of sucker-punching 69-year-old Shirley Teeter, who wears an oxygen tank. Teeter's claims were picked up by national media, and a warrant was issued for his arrest by local police.Smith told Breitbart News at the time that Teeter had ""made up the whole thing."" She noted that Campbell, who has cataracts, cannot see well and was being led through the throng of protesters by his wife. She pointed to Facebook video that shows Teeter approaching Campbell from behind and apparently reaching for his shoulder. He turned around, she said, and Teeter fell down.The Project Veritas video shows Scott Foval, a consultant for Democracy Partners, who works with the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign, taking credit for Teeter's supposed ""assault.""He describes her as a participant in a tactic called ""bird-dogging,"" where trained activists are sent to Trump rallies to instigate violence, either inside or outside. The goal is to create bad press for Trump and a sense of ""anarchy"" around him that will frighten voters.Foval nods when asked if Democracy Partners is responsible for the incident and confirms that she was ""trained,"" though he adds that his group did not have direct contact with Teeter. ""We didn't know who she was ahead of time,"" Foval says.""We just had somebody who connected with her before that rally. And we knew that she was putting herself out there to draw a fire. That's all we knew.""Focal also explained to Project Veritas' undercover journalist how Democracy Partners arranges for a volunteer to help activists with press coverage, to maximize the impact of each ""bird-dogging"" incident, wherever it occurs.He also explained that ""bird-dogging"" operations can recruit activists from any demographic group, using focus groups to filter potential participants, including the elderly.Joel B.

Gilberthorpe disputed Leeds' claims.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""It really depends, I think, on the hour of the day, and the day of the week, as to what this woman is saying,"" Gilberthorpe said of Leeds. ""I mean, let's get it right. She has waited - she said initially 30 years; that was then moved to 35 years. I've got news for her tonight: it was, in fact, 36 years. I'm not guessing. I'm pretty sure. So let me put that down as a marker first.""""She has made these wild allegations about Trump,"" he continued. ""Now, Trump is old enough, bold enough to look after himself. But you know, sometimes you've got to step up to the plate. In fact, always, you have. I really want to stress to you tonight, and to everyone listening, that whether it was Clinton, whether it was Obama, whether it was Donald Trump - if I knew that what was being said about any one of them was a lie, then I would step up to the plate.""""I know what is being said about me on Twitter, and I am so convinced of my cause that I'm prepared to say, 'Who cares?' I'm here, I've got a message, and I want to be heard. And it's not just a message of opinions or thoughts; it's fact. And that's what I'm prepared - and that is why I've literally come here to New York to say my peace,"" he declared.Gilberthorpe agreed with Marlow that one suspicious detail of Leeds' story is that she claims to have been groped for fully 15 minutes. ""I think any objective observer is going to say, 'Hey, hold on. Let's rewind,'"" Gilberthorpe said. ""First interview, no mention whatsoever of anyone. I mean me, I would want to get it out straight away, my message: 'Hey, you know, it's not just me saying it; other people or another person saw it.' But no mention whatsoever.""He said that in later accounts, Leeds began suggesting there was a witness on the flight who could back up her allegations and was eventually ""convinced there was a man to her right.""""I really, really, really do appreciate her confirming the position of myself there because it's helped an awful lot. It's helped me, it's certainly helped Trump, but it hasn't helped her one bit. That's a second marker, if I may put down to you,"" Gilberthorpe said.""Let's just get the scene, okay? We're all in First Class. I think that's pretty much agreed. I know the configuration of the seats. She's helped me by confirming it. Now, for those 15 minutes of this serious sexual assault - because it wasn't just groping; it was a very, very serious sexual assault - she sat there, okay? Now, ladies, ladies listening: you're on an aircraft. Very few places can be so public or so confined. There happens to be, remember in First Class, no sight nor sound of any stewardess whatsoever. Look, I've traveled in First Class quite a bit, and I think any Coach class, Business, or First Class, you do not not see a stewardess for 15 minutes. I mean, frankly, the stewardess, she should be sacked because she's not doing her job,"" he said sarcastically.""Really, the more one analyzes, the nonsense it is,"" he continued. ""She introduces me then, and says that I just sat there. Now guys who are listening, please tell me this. Place yourselves in that seat, the seat that she says in the adjacent aisle. You sit there, and you're watching a man that you had only met three hours previous, that I had met three hours previous, and I am just looking. I am watching a man sexually assault a woman, but the guy - me - just sits there.""Gilberthorpe said this claim was ""more than insulting because it's making me complicit in that assault, and that's pretty serious stuff."" He also complained that media organizations made no effort to contact him and get his side of the story after Leeds began alluding to his presence as a witness.Resuming his own account of the flight, he said he spoke with Trump for a while before takeoff, ""and then, as a matter of fact, Jessica entered through the front entrance of the aircraft. She was shown to her seat. Her jacket was taken and was stored in the wardrobe, which was to the left. She sat down, and she introduced herself, and this Trump and I - I only knew this guy 'Donald' as he introduced himself three hours previous to me; I didn't know it was Donald Trump."" ""It was back in the days. I'd only visited America one time previous to that. I'm not familiar, as I'm sure with respect to a lot of American listeners tonight wouldn't be familiar with a lot of our British businessmen,"" he explained. ""But he was nice. We were talking, we were laughing, he was reading, I was reading, et cetera. She came on, and she hogged the limelight. She wanted to talk to him in a most animated, exaggerated way. About 45 minutes after she had taken her seat and we had taken off, he went to use the toilet.""Gilberthorpe said that during Trump's absence, Leeds told him who his fellow passenger was, excitedly explaining that he was ""one of the richest men in the world.""""And her quote, not mine: 'Oh, I can't believe that I'm sitting next to him. I can't believe it! This is the man I want to marry!' Okay, it was all said in jest and joke, but she was so excited about having the chance, the opportunity, of sitting next to this man. I attempted to talk over to Trump, but she wasn't really having much of it. I was talking to her, to him, for the remaining two-and-a-half hours of the journey. We landed in New York. Having landed, he politely said, 'Goodbye,' shook my hand, and shook hers. He didn't kiss her, didn't kiss her. And she and I left the plane together. She and I exchanged kisses. I went for my luggage. She did not go for her luggage. That's another marker I'm putting down tonight,"" he said.Gilberthorpe said he was ""absolutely flabbergasted"" by the media reaction to Leeds' accusations against Trump.""I first came across the news story on Thursday, just this Thursday gone,"" he recalled. ""I was with friends, and I was looking at the Internet, as I regularly do, and I recognized her, and, of course, by now, I recognized him. I took a bit of a double look, a double take, and I thought, 'Oh, he and her must have been in a relationship and fallen out. She's accusing him of sexual wrongdoing.'""""Then, in reading further, and looking further into the story on other sites that then were carrying it, I couldn't believe - to actually know, for a fact, that she was, in fact, talking about that one time that she says she did meet him, which was the one occasion when I met her and him together, so I then became most aware myself that it was, in fact, that occasion, that particular flight. And I couldn't believe - so I'll tell you what I did: I found the details of Trump's lawyer, and I tell you why, in one way I wanted, and in another way I did not want to involve myself.""""This is another marker,"" he declared. ""I'm sorry to keep saying, but I want to put these markers down because I don't want anyone to contradict me afterwards, and if they do, I'll be able to refer to these markers that I'm putting down tonight.""""So when I read more of the first story - when, as I say, she made no reference at all to seat configurations, to the particular flight, to when it was, where it was, et cetera and so on. She just said that she was on the flight, and this man - in fact, with respect, it was more than grope, it was sexually assaulted her,"" he repeated, also reiterating that if he had witnessed such a crime without intervening, he would be complicit in what British law considers a felony offense.""It's certainly immoral, to say the least, and it's something I could not, and would not, and did not do,"" Gilberthorpe stated.As some other observers have done, Gilberthorpe disputed the part of Leeds' account where she claims the armrest between her seat and Trump's was raised to facilitate his sexual assault, noting there were actually separate armrests for each seat in the First Class cabin. He also said Leeds began dropping the raised-armrest detail from later recountings of the incident.""A prolonged, intended sexual assault. That is what it is. That is what she claims it is,"" he mused. ""And yet, what amazed me - I could not credit what I hear, and really, frankly, the ladies who are listening tonight, ask yourself this: she then said - I think this was her third - because there are so many differences, frankly, between the first and the second and the third statement - she said that had he continued to just touch her breasts, grope her breasts, then perhaps, well, you know, there you are, one of those things, etcetera and so on. It was only when he attempted to do more with respect - I'm sorry to say, these are graphic - to go lower, did she actually think, 'Oh, I'm going.' Now again, how could anyone sit there for 15 minutes with a man next to her, being watched by the man on the other side of her, and simply say it's okay for him to do what he's been doing for 15 minutes, until he went lower, and then she left her seat?""""This is really the reason why I'm here now, and why I've gathered the irrefutable evidence I have,"" Gilberthorpe said. ""Because in saying what she's saying, if we can just take Donald Trump out of the equation a moment, it's accusing two men - one of serious sexual assault and the other being complicit to that sexual assault. Now, again, it suits some people, either in the press or in other political parties, to actually say how bad this is. But you know, it's worse than bad; it's absolutely the most serious sexual assault.""He said he was astounded by comments from Michelle Obama the other day: ""And again I couldn't believe what she was saying, because she was talking about these women, including Jessica, as though what they were saying had actually been tested through the courts, and she was reading from a judgment of a court where Trump had, in fact, been judged by his peers, by the judge and jury, and found guilty. But he hasn't.""""I'll tell you what really gets to me, is the fact that, as I say, whether it was Trump or whether it was Clinton, I have no allegiance to any of them. In fact, in truth, I favor none of them. I need to stress that,"" Gilberthorpe stated. ""As I say, whoever it was there, but let's just say it was Joe Public; it was one of your listeners. Imagine how would they be able to take it? A lesser man, frankly, would have - well, I don't know how anyone could take it. Because you look, with respect, if I may be so bold as to say yourself - if people, six or seven people are coming forward with no evidence whatsoever, but of saying the same thing, then that really is, you know it's too much for most people to bear,"" he ventured.He concluded by saying, ""So assured as I am of the evidence that I have is that I have stepped up to the plate. I know what is being said about me on Twitter and various, and frankly, it's a side issue to me. I'm here, I've now come to New York, and I'm prepared to stand up and say - because I'd say it for anyone: 'Enough's enough.'

The Wikileaks email trove produced a legal memorandum addressed to Hillary For America (HFA), explaining what types of communication are permitted and prohibited under federal campaign finance laws. It notes:Communications between HFA and Priorities should generally be limited to each entity's finance directors - Dennis Cheng (HFA) and Justin Brennan (Priorities). Communications between Dennis and Justin should be limited to fundraising; they should not discuss polling, research, or other nonpublic strategic information or plans pertaining to either organization's communications or spending. Moreover, we understand that Justin is not privy to Priorities' nonpublic strategic information or plans, which adds an additional layer of protection.However, the communications described by Democracy Partners consultant Scott Foval arguably go far beyond that. According to Foval, a network of consultants maintains the ""Pony Express,"" which he describes as ""a text conversation that never ends.""

Often, the tactic uses the most vulnerable people -- including the elderly and disabled -- to maximize shock value.O'Keefe's extensive video investigation reveals that the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) are involved in ""bird-dogging"" and other provocative tactics through a web of consultants led by Robert Creamer, a veteran Chicago activist and convicted felon who is thought to have planned Democrats' political strategy during the push for Obamacare in 2009 and 2010.Creamer is also the co-founder of Democracy Partners, a consulting group that, according to Project Veritas videos, apparently contracts directly with the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC, and that works with an array of super PACs and consultants to organize, film and publicize their provocations.Robert Creamer (Screenshot / Project Veritas)Creamer affirms on one video that Clinton is aware of ""all"" of his work, and that Democracy Partners has a daily telephone call with the Clinton campaign to coordinate efforts.O'Keefe and his team also obtained hidden camera videos showing one of Creamer's consultants, Scott Foval, describing ""bird-dogging,"" among other tactics, and taking credit for having instigated violence at several Republican events during the 2016 election cycle.Foval -- who praises Creamer as ""diabolical"" -- explains how ""bird-dogging"" works: how they plan confrontations in advance, choose particular individuals to provoke, and maximize media coverage.FOVAL: So one of the things we do is we stage very authentic grassroots protests right in their faces at their own events. Like, we infiltrate. And then we get it on tape. And then, when our guys get beat up --Project Veritas: You mean authentic-seeming grassroots?FOVAL: No, authentic.PV: You mean --FOVAL: Protesters.PV: So like -- progressive, what we saw in Madison.FOVAL: We train up our people, wherever they are, to -- and I work with a network of groups, we train them up on how to get themselves into a situation on tape, on camera, that we can use later.PV: So some of this, so I probably know your work.FOVAL: I know you do. Everybody does. But --PV: You mean like a situation where it's sort of like a --FOVAL: You remember the Iowa State Fair thing where Scott Walker grabbed the sign out of the dude's hand and then the dude gets kind of roughed up right in front of the stage right there on camera?PV: Yeah.FOVAL: That was all us. The guy that got roughed up is my counterpart, who works for Bob [Creamer].PV: And that was like, storyboarded? Him getting roughed up like that?FOVAL: We scenarioed it.PV: And so you, like leant yourselves to that situation and it happened. A self-fulfilling prophecy.FOVAL: We not only leant ourselves, we planted multiple people in that front area around him and in the back to make sure there wasn't just a action that happened up front, there was also a reaction that happened out back. So the cameras, when they saw it, saw double angles of stuff like, they saw what happened up front, and they saw the reaction of people out back.PV: That's fucking brilliant. That's brilliant.FOVAL: And then the reporters had people to talk to.Foval also tells Project Veritas's undercover journalist that Republicans are less adept at such tactics because they obey rules: ""They have fewer guys willing to step out on the line for what they believe in. ... There is a level of adherence to rules on the other side that only when you're at the very highest level, do you get over.""In another video, Foval admits that his organization is responsible for an incident in Asheville, North Carolina in September, where an elderly woman was allegedly assaulted outside a Trump rally.In that incident, the 69-year-old woman, wearing an oxygen tank, heckled a visually impaired 73-year-old Trump supporter, then pursued him. She claimed he then punched her in the jaw, though she had no visible injury; his attorney claims she touched him on the shoulder first, and then fell to the ground as he turned around. The national media covered her claims widely, while largely ignoring his. Foval explains that the woman had been ""trained"" as a part of his operation.Foval also explains how the operation is set up to allow the DNC and the Clinton campaign ""plausible deniability"" in the event that the true nature of the deliberate violence is discovered: ""The thing that we have to watch is making sure there's a double-blind between the actual campaign and the actual DNC and what we're doing. There's a double-blind there, so that they can plausibly deny that they heard anything about it.""He explains the flow of money in ""rapid response"" operations: ""The campaign pays DNC, DNC pays Democracy Partners, Democracy Partners pays the Foval Group, the Foval Group goes and executes the shit on the ground.""And Foval emphasizes that the goal of ""bird-dogging"" is to create a sense of ""anarchy"" around Trump: ""The bird-dogging. The aggressive bird-dogging. What I call it is 'conflict engagement.' ... Conflict engagement in the lines at Trump rallies? We're starting anarchy. And he needs to understand that we're starting anarchy.""Scott Foval (Project Veritas / Screenshot)In another video, Foval notes that the Clinton campaign and the DNC are involved, through a chain of contracts: ""We are contracted directly with the DNC and the campaign. I am contracted to [Robert Creamer] but I answer to the head of special events for the DNC and the head of special events and political for the campaign. Through Bob. We have certain people who do not get to talk to them, at all.""He explains that Democracy Partners then provides material from the field to the campaign, the DNC, and a wide array of left-wing super PACs and organizations involved in the 2016 election effort:We have a clip deliverable that we have to deliver every day for our groups of clients who are involved in this project: AUFC; A4C, which is Alliance for Change; Alliance for Retired Americans, which is part of AFL-CIO -- they're one of our partners on the AUFC stuff ... Depends on the issue. And then there's the DNC, and the campaigns, and Priorities [USA]. Priorities is a big part of this, too. The campaigns and DNC cannot coordinate with Priorities, but I guaran-damn-tee you that the people who run the Super PACs all talk to each other, and we and a few other people are the hubs of that communication.He also explains how the campaign and the super PACs use consultants as intermediaries for communication, since federal law prevents them from coordinating directly. He calls the system the ""Pony Express,"" linking the DNC through Robert Creamer, through Robert Creamer to Foval, and through Foval to Brad Woodhouse's super-PAC, Americans United for Change:FOVAL: We're consultants, so we're not the official entity. And so those conversations can be had between consultants who are working for different parts. That's why there's Bob, who's the primary there, and I'm a sub to him.

It's like that. It's kind of like an ongoing ""Pony Express."" It's not as official as it could be, but that's because the law doesn't allow it to be.The videos obtained by O'Keefe and Project Veritas corroborate earlier evidence of a Democratic plan to use violent imagery against the Trump campaign. A DNC PowerPoint presentation from April released by Wikileaks includes a plan to cite ""incidents of violence"" to create the ""desired perception"" that ""Trump is dangerous and divisive, undermining our values and putting our security at risk.""The ""bird-dogging"" carried out by Creamer and others would appear to be part of that effort.In one hidden camera video, filmed at Creamer's Washington, D.C. office, Creamer explains that Hillary Clinton is aware of ""all"" of his activities, directly or indirectly, and that Democracy Partners has a daily conference call with the Clinton campaign, as well as frequent calls with the White House.Wikileaks reveals that at least one ""bird-dogging"" operation was approved directly by Robby Mook, Hillary Clinton's campaign manager. In an email dated July 4, 2015, Mook approved a plan ""to bird dog"" Donald Trump, meaning specifically to infiltrate volunteers into his campaign events and ask him questions about immigration.Mook e-mail (Wikileaks) Trump supporters have frequently been the victims of real, as opposed to staged, violence.In June, for instance, Trump supporters leaving a rally in San Jose were attacked, beaten and chased by left-wing mobs. One woman was pelted with eggs in full view of the national media. The mayor of San Jose blamed Trump for the violence.Last week, Hillary Clinton supporters attacked a man carrying a sign that read ""Bill Clinton is a Rapist"" at rally in Las Vegas hosted by the Carpenters Union.Creamer, who is married to Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), is a Saul Alinsky acolyte who trained many of the key political figures in the Chicago clique that surrounds Barack Obama. He went to prison in 2006-7 for a check-kiting scheme, but was hired by Obama to train volunteers for his 2008 presidential campaign.In 2011, Creamer opened Democracy Partners together with other veteran left-wing organizers, including Heather Booth. Creamer's occasional columns at the Huffington Post also provide talking points to left-wing activists throughout the country, and are circulated among key Democratic staff.(Full disclosure: the author ran against Schakowsky for Congress in 2010).Joel B.

""But for more sophisticated audiences or interviews, his points are useful add-ons.""As Breitbart News previously reported, the WikiLeaks emails show that Clinton's evolution on TPP was politically motivated, as top members of her staff worked tirelessly to explain why she had to oppose the deal.When it was clear that the campaign would finally move to oppose the deal, the campaign's Labor Outreach Director Nikki Budzinski emailed to signal her delight.""I'm very glad HRC has gotten to the oppose position, this will be very helpful with mobilization on the ground and support within labor during and after this primary,"" she wrote.But Budzinski warned that it might be better for Clinton to wait until the full text of the deal was released, so it didn't look like she was merely positioning herself politically.It was clear, however, that the campaign could not wait any longer.""We can't survive hemming and hawing for 3 weeks,"" Podesta wrote on Tuesday, October 6.On October 7, Clinton announced her decision to oppose TPP after labor leaders signaled that it was a decisive condition for their endorsement.""America's working people are very pleased that Senator Clinton is opposed to the Trans-Pacific Partnership,"" said Trumka in a statement after Clinton's announcement.

We're worried that there is still so much to do and that these are not yet there,"" said Lise Grande, the UN's humanitarian coordinator in Iraq.""In a worst-case scenario, we're literally looking at the single largest humanitarian operation in the world in 2016. In Mosul, depending on what happens militarily, a million people could... move in a time span of a couple of weeks.""If even a sixth of that number of people flee at the same time, it would overwhelm any capacity to help them.- Inadequate funding -""There's an informal rule of thumb that any population movement over 150,000 people at once, no institution in the world can deal with it,"" Grande said.The UN said after Baghdad announced the launch of the operation on Monday that an estimated 1.5 million people still live in the Mosul area and that the fighting could displace up to one million.Those who flee Mosul will likely be able to bring little or nothing with them, meaning basic necessities such as food, water, shelter and clothing will have to be provided.""Many of them are expected to leave Mosul with only the clothes on their backs,"" said Becky Bakr Abdulla of the Norwegian Refugee Council.Despite the massive scale of the humanitarian operation needed to assist people fleeing Mosul, funding is a major problem: of $367 million requested, significantly less than half has been received so far.The International Organisation for Migration has announced that it will build ""emergency sites"" that will provide shelter and basic services for 200,000 people, but said last week that it still needed additional funding.Iraqi forces will have to fight their way through IS-held territory to reach the city, then surround it and launch an assault to retake it.- 'From one hell to another' -Depending on how long that takes, major displacement from the city could come as winter sets in, leaving people with limited shelter in the freezing desert nights.Mosul civilians will be in grave danger during the fighting, caught in the middle of shelling, air strikes and firefights, and may also be held as human shields by IS.""Worst-case scenario, in the densely populated districts of the city... there could be tens of thousands, maybe even hundreds of thousands of civilians at extreme risk, depending upon what Daesh does,"" said Grande, using an Arabic acronym for IS.""If Daesh rings districts with (bombs), if they put snipers at key points, we could see a situation where civilians become human shields,"" she said.Of three Iraqi cities that have been recaptured from IS, only Fallujah had a substantial civilian population, and the way that operation unfolded does not bode well for Mosul.Tens of thousands of people fled the city and surrounding areas in an exodus that appeared to catch the aid community flat-footed, leaving displaced Iraqis in squalid, overcrowded camps.After people escape Mosul, ""hopefully, the humanitarian society will then be able to provide these people with the help they need, so that they don't step from one hell into another hell,"" Abdulla saidSIGN UP"

Under Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and MDHHS guidelines, every refugee who completes such a screening is tested for latent TB infection.But MDHHS says neither the counties nor the private refugee health screening services share this data with them, and the counties and private refugee health screening services who have the refugee latent TB infection data refuse to make that information public.In the case of at least one private refugee health screening service, the Arab American and Chaldean Council, which MDHHS has hired to conduct refugee health screenings in Wayne County, Macomb County, and Oakland County, that data is also not being shared with health departments in those counties. Providing that data to local county health departments is a requirement of the Refugee Act of 1980.As Breitbart News has reported, a number of states routinely make this important public health data available in annual reports: Minnesota, where the latent TB infection rate among newly arrived refugees in 2014 was 22 percent, Indiana (26 percent),  Arizona (18 percent), Utah (18 percent), Texas (15 percent), and California (12 percent), and Florida (12 percent).Other states and resettlement agencies have made the data available after repeated requests from Breitbart News: Tennessee (27 percent), Vermont (35 percent), and Idaho (21 percent).Identifying and treating refugees who arrive with latent TB infection rates is an important element in state and national TB control programs because numerous medical studies, including one conducted at the University of California at San Diego in 2013, have shown that high rates of latent TB infection among resettled refugees pose a public health risk to the general public in communities in which they have resettled.Latent TB becomes a health risk when it activates into active and infectious TB, a process usually associated with a lowered level of immunity among patients who have latent TB.Four percent of the general population in the United States has latent TB infection. Ten percent of this group develops active TB at some point in their life.In contrast, 33 percent of the population in the rest of the world has latent TB infection. When refugees arrive in the United States from other parts of the world with latent TB infection, medical studies suggest that their activation rate is higher than ten percent, due to a number of factors that reduce their immune systems, including crowded living circumstances, failure to initiate or complete latent TB infection medical treatment, and lifestyle choices, such as smoking.Though it refuses to provide latent TB infection rate data on refugees, Michigan is one of fifteen states for which Breitbart News has obtained data on the number of refugees diagnosed with active TB.All told, 468 refugees have been diagnosed with active TB in these fifteen states:Minnesota (296), Wisconsin (27), Nebraska (21), Louisiana (21), Michigan (19),  Vermont (17), Colorado (16), Florida (11), Ohio (11 in one county), Idaho (7), Kentucky (9 in one county), North Dakota (4 in one county),  Indiana (4), California (3), and Tennessee, where two refugees have been diagnosed with the very dangerous, multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB.The vast majority of the more than 4,000 refugees who arrived in Michigan in FY 2016 were resettled in eight counties: Wayne, Oakland, Macomb, Kent, Ingham, Washtenaw, Calhoun, and Kalamazoo.MDHHS says it has contracted with the county health departments in Kent County, Calhoun County, and Ingham County to conduct initial domestic medical screenings of refugees resettled in their jurisdictions. It has contracted with the Arab and American Chaldean Council to conduct initial domestic medical screenings in Wayne County, Macomb County, and Oakland County. In September 2015, it switched its contracted refugee health service screener in Washtenaw County from the Washtenaw County Health Department to St. Joseph's Hospital. In Kalamazoo County, it has contracted with a local private service rather than the Kalamazoo County, according to the Kalamazoo County Health Department.Breitbart News has contacted all eight county health departments in these counties.Two counties that conduct their own initial domestic medical screenings of refugees (Kent and Ingham) have refused to provide latent TB refugee health data. One county that conducts its own initial domestic medical screening for refugees (Calhoun) says it will not be able to provide that data until November. The one county that previously conducted its own domestic medical screening of refugees (Washtenaw) says the data is not readily available.Three of the four counties in which domestic medical screenings of refugees have been conducted by a private service for several years (Oakland, Macomb, and Kalamazoo) tell Breitbart News they do not have latent TB refugee health data in their possession. One of the four counties in which domestic medical screenings of refugees have been conducted by a private service for several years (Wayne County) has not responded to Breitbart News' inquiries.In Kent County (Grand Rapids), a longtime destination for refugees from high TB-burden countries, the Kent County Health Department is refusing to offer any public explanation for a huge spike of foreign-born cases of TB in 2011. In that year, the Michigan public health region that includes Kent County, population 602,000, and eleven surrounding rural counties with smaller populations, reported 22 foreign-born cases of active TB. (See page 24 of the 2009-2013 Michigan Tuberculosis Epidemiologic Trends Report, published by the Michigan Department of Community Health.)Breitbart first asked Kent County about latent TB rates among refugees and the 2011 TB spike on September 10.One month later, on October 13, after several subsequent email exchanges, a spokesperson for Kent County told Breitbart News, ""Due to potential HIPAA concerns identified through our data collection process, the data request is under legal review. We will reply accordingly as soon as possible.""When Breitbart News responded that HIPAA claims for aggregate data are entirely unwarranted, the spokesperson responded, ""We will need your data inquiry processed as a FOIA.We will respond to this inquiry after receipt of a FOIA request.""It's a similar story in Macomb, Wayne, Ingham, Calhoun, Washtenaw, and Kalamazoo counties, other primary locations for refugee resettlement in Michigan.""The data you are requesting is contained in the Federal EDN [Electronic Disease Notification] system, not in any Macomb County system,"" a spokeperson for the Macomb County Health Department tells Breitbart News.""No, that data is not in the Federal EDN system,"" Breitbart responded, and posed this follow-up question:The vendor selected by the state of Michigan to conduct domestic medical screenings in Macomb County, the Arab-American Council, has the data.According to the Refugee Act of 1980, they are supposed to provide that data to Macomb County Public Health.Are they providing you that data or not?Breitbart News has not received a response to that question from the Macomb County Health Department.In Macomb County, one member of Secure Michigan, a local grassroots group, has repeatedly attempted to contact County Executive Mark Hackel, to no avail:Here is the timeline on trying to reach out to Macomb County Executive Mark Hackel to see what position he is taking on the refugees coming into Macomb County. I'm sure he is a welcoming partner, since he developed ""One Macomb.""I first left a message for him through one of his assistants back on Sept. 14th.I called back again on Sept. 21st saying I received no response back on setting up a possible meeting with Mr. Hackel. They said they would again forward my message. I called on Oct. 11th. to say this was my third time calling, and the assistant said I should email Kim Elward, Executive Assistant at the Macomb County Executive Office. I have emailed and still no response to my request from a Secure Michigan spokesperson for a meeting with Mr. Hackel to provide him with the economic, health, and security concerns of refugees being seeded into Macomb County and our state.""We are no longer the provider for local health refugee screening (as of September 2015),"" a spokesperson for the Washtenaw County Public Health Department (Ann Arbor) tells Breitbart News:Prior to that time we did health screenings and reported to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) as required. The information reported does not necessarily address all of your questions. In addition, our local information is not in a format that can be quickly reported to you within the time frame you requested it. I will provide an update as soon as possible and/or ask you to submit a public information request as needed.When pressed by Breitbart News to provide latent TB infection rates among arriving refugees during the period Washtenaw County conducted refugee health screenings, the spokesperson said, ""We are working to compile this information, where we can, from our records.""""While I can compile information in response to your request, I will not be able to meet your deadline of 9am EST Friday, Oct 14th,"" a spokesperson for the Calhoun County Health Department tells Breitbart News, adding that a response will come ""probably not until early November. We are booked solid with Flu clinics currently.""Wayne County's director of the Department of Health, Veterans, and Community Wellness, Dr. Mouhanad Hammami, did not respond to Breitbart News' request for details on latent TB infection rates among arriving refugees in that jurisdiction.The Ingham County Health Department also did not respond to Breitbart News' request for details on latent TB infection rates among arriving refugees in their jurisdiction.""Kalamazoo County Health Department does not complete Refugee Medical Screenings, so we do not have the records you have requested. I would recommend reaching out to the State of Michigan (Michigan Department of Health & Human Services) directly for this data,"" a spokesperson for the Kalamazoo County Health Department tells Breitbart News.In contrast to every other Michigan county health department contacted by Breitbart News, Oakland County has been responsive and provided all the available data in its posession, which did not include latent TB infection rates of arriving refugeees because the state contracted health refugee assessment provider, the Arab American Chaldean Council (ACC), whose legal duty it is to provide that data to Oakland County, is apparently is not sharing that data with the county.Breitbart News has contacted ACC several times but has received no response.Oakland County Executive L. Brooks Patterson has said he intends to sue the federal government for its resettlement of refugees within the county's jurisdiction without complying with the Refugee Act of 1980's consultation clause. That clause requires the federal government and the director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement to consult with executives of state and local governments prior to the resettlement of refugees within their jurisdictions.""Secure Michigan supports the efforts of Brooks Patterson to protect the citizens of Oakland County, by utilizing the legal system as necessary as necessary based on the gross failure of the refugee industry to consult with the county government while delivering more than 10,000 refugees to the county including recently more than 4% of the national total of unvetted Syrian refugees,"" a spokesperson for the local Michigan grassroots group tells Breitbart News:The situation in Macomb County is different. The county government has been more than complicit in transforming the county via refugees including recently more than 3 percent of the total of national total of unvetted Syrian refugees. The inability for citizens of Macomb County to receive vital refugee health information should be alarming to families with children in schools and to other vulnerable communities. Mental health issues like PTSD are a particular problem for refugee families. Will it take individual citizens as part of a class action lawsuit to pry the health records from the county government?Many state and local governments around the country exhibit Michigan's culture of concealment when it comes to reporting both latent TB infection rates among refugees and active TB cases diagnosed among refugees. In fact, the majority of the fifty states currently do not make data on refugee latent TB infection rates or the number of refugees diagnosed with active TB available to the public.Minnesota (296), Wisconsin (27), Nebraska (21), Louisiana (21), Michigan (19),  Vermont (17), Colorado (16), Florida (11), Ohio (11 in one county), Idaho (7), Kentucky (9 in one county), North Dakota (4 in one county),  Indiana (4), California (3), and Tennessee, where two refugees have been diagnosed with the very dangerous, multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB.The vendor selected by the state of Michigan to conduct domestic medical screenings in Macomb County, the Arab-American Council, has the data.
According to the Refugee Act of 1980, they are supposed to provide that data to Macomb County Public Health.
Are they providing you that data or not?Here is the timeline on trying to reach out to Macomb County Executive Mark Hackel to see what position he is taking on the refugees coming into Macomb County. I'm sure he is a welcoming partner, since he developed ""One Macomb.""

15	http://www.breitbart.com/abortion/2016/10/17/ending-days-personally-opposed-abortion/	Ending The Policy of Only ‘Personally Opposed to Abortion’	"Imagine that you're watching an infomercial. For almost a half hour, you hear the hosts promote a product, saying that it should be widely available because it offers so many benefits.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBut at the end of the program, after explaining how everyone could use this item, the hosts look into the camera and say, ""We want you to know that, personally, we wouldn't touch this product with a ten-foot pole. We have major problems with it, although we won't tell you what those problems are. In fact, we won't even describe to you how the product works. And forget about ever seeing it on TV. But if you still want it, we say go for it!""Sound fishy? Raise a red flag or two for you?Of course, but that, in essence, is the pitch that politicians who are ""personally opposed"" to abortion expect you to buy.They insist that there's a ""right"" to take an unborn child's life for any reason at any stage of pregnancy and that taxpayers should finance the procedure. They say abortion is beneficial to society. But in the same breath they add that they want nothing to do with it in their own lives.What's more, these officials won't say why they wouldn't abort their own children.And as for explaining what's involved in the abortion procedure itself, mum's the word. They would never quote a line from the medical textbooks describing abortion.And forget about ever seeing it on TV.The hypocritical stance of ""pro-choice/personally opposed"" politicians boils down to this - they encourage abortion by making it as easily accessible as possible, but then turn around and refuse to defend what they encourage, or even describe what they defend.For decades, we've heard the mantra from candidates and office holders that they would never impose their personal beliefs on others by making even one abortion illegal. Most recently, we heard Senator Tim Kaine in the vice-presidential debate assert that ""it is not the role of the public servant to mandate"" the commands of his or her faith.But in the case of abortion, why not?Just because a policy coincides with your religious beliefs is no reason to claim that that policy cannot be enacted into law. Witness entire state criminal code sections that are in harmony with Biblical prohibitions on murder, stealing, and lying. The freedom to disbelieve the Bible isn't the same as freedom to murder, steal, or lie.My own Catholic faith - a faith that many ""pro-choice/personally opposed"" politicians such as Senator Kaine say they embrace - has taught for two millennia that abortion is always gravely wrong because it is the taking of a human life. This profound teaching raises the question, if Catholic politicians know that abortion takes a human life, how can they say that killing another person is merely a matter of personal conscience?The unavoidable truth for ""pro-choice/personally opposed"" politicians, Catholic or otherwise, is that the baby in the womb is not a religious belief. He or she is a physical reality. The unborn child's humanity is not established by the Church, it's respected and upheld by the Church.Science teaches that a human life begins at its beginning - when egg and sperm unite to form the first cell of an entirely new person - not at some arbitrary point in an unborn baby's development. In fact, science informs the entire pro-life position - just ask a pro-life atheist.So, if you personally oppose abortion because it destroys an innocent human life - which is the fundamental reason to object to abortion - and you're a liberal politician who supports terminating other people's unborn children, you must frame abortion as only a religious question. It's easier to categorize the unborn child's humanity as a belief than it is to recognize it as an objective, verifiable scientific fact. Plus, that way you don't have to talk about the blood-and-guts inhumanity of abortion.But I say to Senator Kaine and other ""pro-choice/personally opposed"" politicians of both parties, if you know the truth of what abortion is, then be honest and tell us. Describe what it is that you privately oppose, but publicly support.For instance, in federal court testimony, abortionist Carolyn Westhoff noted, ""In the dismemberment D&E...it is necessary to insert our forceps...and then crush the head."" The ""pro-choice/personally opposed"" politician should tell us why crushing the head of an unborn child is acceptable as long as it isn't that of his own son or daughter.Abortionist Warren Hern wrote in his textbook Abortion Practice that in second-trimester abortions, ""A long curved Mayo scissors may be necessary to decapitate and dismember the fetus...."" Perhaps a candidate could inform voters that he personally opposes decapitation.And abortionist Martin Haskell testified in federal court, ""When you're doing a dismemberment D&E, usually the last part to be removed is the skull itself and it's floating free inside the uterine cavity...So it's rather like a ping-pong ball floating around...."" We must ask the ""pro-choice/personally opposed"" lawmaker, is this what you mean when you say ""reproductive health""?The days of the personally-opposed-to-abortion subterfuge are over. If a politician wants abortion on demand to be legal, he should defend his position. And if he wants to run away from abortion while he promotes it, he should at least tell us why. Fr.

The sooner it's on the ocean floor - providing a marvellous PS200 million habitat for all manner of marine creatures - the sooner it will be unavailable to ferry around activist scientists making mischief with their cherry picked data, politically loaded hypotheses, and insane policy prescriptions.A good example of this was given by Attenborough himself: the British Antarctic Survey scientists who spotted the hole in the ozone layer and helped effect the worldwide ban in 1996 on CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) - used in aerosol cans and refrigerators.And what was the effect on the ozone layer of this massively intrusive, monumentally expensive piece of meddling global legislation?It made no difference. The hole stopped growing before the ban took effect, then failed to shrink afterwards. We still can't be sure that CFCs were the culprit. What we can be sure of is that this well-meaning legislation led to a massive explosion in the use of HFCs (hydrofluorocarbons) as a substitute. And if you believe experts like US Secretary of State John Kerry, these are a pollutant even more powerful than CFCs because of their deadly greenhouse gas capability, ""equivalent to the emissions of 300 coal-fired power plants every year.""So now, at even more expense, HFCs are going to be banned too. This was decided at a meeting in Kigali, Rwanda last week attended by delegates (and their entourages) from 150 nations. (Luckily they all arrived by bicycle - otherwise, just imagine the carbon footprint of all those jets they didn't take...)Christopher Booker captures the absurdity and pointlessness of the exercise well:As usual, of course, the West, led by US Secretary of State John Kerry, is absolutely gung-ho for the ban to be introduced as soon as possible, in not more than five to 10 years.But, equally inevitably, other countries, led by China and India, say they cannot possibly ban HFCs so quickly, not before 2031. Indeed, as we know, many ""developing"" countries, again led by China and India, as already the world's first and third largest CO2 emitters, have made clear that they have every intention of building thousands more coal-fired power stations, which will massively to increase those emissions anyway.Although it would be sad then to see PS200 million of taxpayers' money to go straight to the bottom after the tragic iceberg collision, the money saved in the wider global economy would be enormous.And we haven't even got onto the benefits in the field of ""climate change."" With fewer scientists stomping around the Antarctic looking for stories to give to BBC journalists that the case for action on climate change is more urgent than ever before, there will be less pressure on governments to take pointless measures to deal with this non existent problem.So that will mean: fewer rainforests being chopped down to grow biofuels; fewer solar arrays frying birds; fewer wind turbines slicing and dicing bats and eagles; fewer old people dying in fuel poverty as a result of energy prices artificially inflated by renewable tariffs; more money available to deal with real environmental problems like overfishing by out-of-control EU member state factory fleets...If Mother Gaia could speak, I'm sure she'd want this vessel sunk as soon as possible. Or maybe if Greenpeace's more zealous representatives were listening to her wounded cries, they could take direct action themselves. Call it revenge for the Rainbow Warrior.As usual, of course, the West, led by US Secretary of State John Kerry, is absolutely gung-ho for the ban to be introduced as soon as possible, in not more than five to 10 years.
But, equally inevitably, other countries, led by China and India, say they cannot possibly ban HFCs so quickly, not before 2031.

Lt. Col. Ali Hussein said his men were also anxious to move out to the front line as soon as possible, but expected they would wait near the town of Khazer for another day or two. He spoke just hours after the long-awaited battle began Monday morning.According to Hussein, an earlier political deal between the country's Kurdish region and the central government in Baghdad has agreed that Kurdish forces would advance first and bring a cluster of villages -- the home of Christian, Shabak and other minority groups -- under their regional control.Saud Masoud, also with the special forces, said that after the Kurdish troops ""take the area that they want,"" the special forces would then move to the new front and continue the push into Mosul.Abadi vowed that only government forces would enter Mosul, a Sunni-majority city that IS seized with relative ease partly because of local resentment towards the Shiite-dominated security forces.Shiite militia groups have been accused of serious abuses against Sunni civilians in the course of operations to reconquer territory from IS.""The force leading liberation operations is the brave Iraqi army with the national police and they are the ones that will enter Mosul, not others,"" Abadi said.Baghdad is also keen to check the influence of the autonomous Kurdish region, which significantly expanded the territory it controls on the back of the 2014 jihadist assault.The Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary organization, which is dominated by Tehran-backed militia groups, has made clear it wants to take part in the Mosul operation.Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga forces have been moving in from the eastern side of the city while a US-led coalition is also providing support in the air and on the ground.Turkey, which borders northern Iraq, has also offered to join the offensive on Mosul.The start of the much-delayed offensive on Mosul risks sparking a humanitarian crisis, with the United Nations warning that up to one million people may be displaced by the fighting as winter sets in.The jihadists are not thought to number more than 5,000 and will be vastly outnumbered but the battleground is vast and the area's ethnic and religious diversity makes it politically complex.Abadi's announcement came a day after rebel forces in the Syrian half of IS' shrinking ""caliphate"" retook Dabiq, a town which holds crucial ideological significance for the group and where it had promised an apocalyptic battle.Iraqi forces recently retook Qayyarah, an area some 60 kilometers (35 miles) south of Mosul, setting the stage for the final push on IS's northern bastion.The force that has led operations to recapture other IS strongholds in Iraq, such as Fallujah in June or Ramadi earlier this year, is the elite counter-terrorism service.Thousands of other army and police forces have also been converging on Mosul in recent weeks.Abadi has promised that Iraq would be rid of the most violent organization in modern jihad by year's end.But even the recapture of Mosul will not mark the end of the war against IS, which still holds other territory in Iraq and is likely to turn increasingly to insurgent tactics such as bombings and hit-and-run attacks as it loses more ground.SIGN UP"

But Dabiq holds crucial ideological importance for IS and its followers because of a Sunni prophecy that states it will be the site of an end-of-times battle between Christian forces and Muslims.US Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said Dabiq's ""liberation gives the campaign to deliver ISIL a lasting defeat new momentum in Syria.""The Observatory, a Britain-based monitoring group, said rebel forces ""captured Dabiq after IS members withdrew from the area"".The Fastaqim Union, an Ankara-backed rebel faction involved in the battle, said Dabiq had fallen ""after fierce clashes"".Fastaqim said rebels then went on to seize several nearby towns, including Sawran, Ihtimaylat, and Salihiyah.Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency said nine rebels were killed and 28 wounded during fighting to capture the towns.Rebel commander Haitham Ibrahim Afassi told AFP: ""I thank God for giving us victory. The heros of the Free Syrian Army have liberated the region.""Video footage showed the streets of the town virtually deserted, with black IS flags painted on the facades of buildings as well as jihadist graffiti.Dabiq has become a byword among IS supporters for a struggle against the West, with Washington and its allies who are bombing the jihadists portrayed as modern-day Crusaders.IS, which seized control of large parts of Syria and Iraq in mid-2014 and declared an Islamic ""caliphate"", has been dealt a series of military defeats this year and is bracing for an assault on its key Iraqi stronghold Mosul.Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Sunday that Turkish-backed rebels would now focus on taking the jihadist-held town of Al-Bab in Aleppo province.- 'Crimes against humanity' -Turkey launched an unprecedented operation inside Syria on August 24, helping Syrian rebels to rid its frontier of IS jihadists and Syrian Kurdish militia.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Saturday said Turkey would push further south to create a 5,000-square-kilometre (1,900 square-mile) safe zone in Syria.Clashes took place in Aleppo's northern and southern outskirts on Sunday, as well as in the city centre, the Observatory said.Air strikes on rebel-held eastern areas killed 31 people, including 15 civilians who died in Russian raids, it added.An AFP correspondent said two buildings had been destroyed and reported nearly non-stop air raids on the opposition-held half of the city since midnight.US Secretary of State John Kerry, in London Sunday for talks on Syria with his British and French counterparts, branded the bombardment of civilians in Aleppo ""crimes against humanity"".British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson warned of possible sanctions.""There are a lot of measures that we're proposing including extra measures on the regime and their supporters,"" Johnson said.""These things will eventually come to bite the perpetrators of these crimes, and they should think about it now,"" he warned.Rebel fire on government-controlled districts of Aleppo left three people dead and more than two dozen wounded, Syrian state news agency SANA said.- 'No appetite for war' -Fighting has surged in the city following the collapse last month of a ceasefire brokered by the United States and Russia, raising deep international concern.Kerry was in London to brief Washington's European allies after ""brainstorming"" talks in Lausanne with the main players in Syria's conflict, but hopes for a breakthrough in the conflict that has killed more than 300,000 people since 2011 remained dim.Saturday's meeting in Lausanne did not produce a concrete plan to restore the truce that collapsed amid bitter recriminations between Washington and Moscow.Kerry warned Sunday that US President Barack Obama had not taken any option off the table in trying to stop the killing, but downplayed the possibility of increased military action in Syria.""We are discussing every mechanism available to us but I haven't seen a big appetite from anyone in Europe to go to war,"" he said.SIGN UP"

Gohmert, who admits he was not in Trump's corner to begin with, explains:In his days as a Democrat funder and his friendship with Bill Clinton, Donald Trump's language was extremely inappropriate, even though Barrack Obama can be seen on video using the same exact language. I knew Donald Trump had such a background, and anticipate there are more atrocious comments in his storied background to be revealed which the mainstream media has been waiting to publicize til October. That's a reason I didn't support him in the primary.However, even knowing Trump's past indiscretions, Gohmert believes that Hillary Clinton is not deserving of the office for which she is currently striving. ""I do condemn Donald Trump's past language, but will do everything I can legally and ethically to see he is elected as President instead of Hillary Clinton. If he is not elected, subpoenaing sermon notes as happened in Houston is a drop in the bucket to what is coming.""Gohmert goes on to point out that, [Hillary] ""has become enriched by, among other things, accommodating the sale of U.S. uranium to Russia. Russia is increasing their nuclear arsenal while ours is deteriorating, but got millions rather than the standard 30 pieces of silver.""As a Christian like millions of American's, Gohmert echoes the concerns about Trump and Clinton's religious beliefs. ""Dr. James Dobson tells me Trump truly has become a Christian, though obviously with a lot to learn. "" Gohmert continues, ""Hillary staunchly condemns those who follow Moses' and Jesus' teaching on marriage and will push even further than the Supreme Court already has until marriage becomes what it was 'in the days of Noah' before the flood. That's rather dangerous.""""I also know that people have 4 choices: (1) vote for Hillary; (2) vote for Trump; (3) vote for a someone besides these two; or (4) don't vote,"" Gohmert said. He highlights the fact that ""Three of those four choices elect Hillary, who supports our killing of 1.2 million more babies a year. Previously I would say ""unborn babies"" but in a recent hearing, we found no Democrats to support a bill that made it illegal to kill a child born alive after an attempted abortion.""As most American's know as well as Gohmert, it is not just the presidency at stake this election. With one seat already waiting to be filled on the Supreme Court, and others possibly being vacated shortly, the balance of the highest court in America, the one the governs us all, hangs in the balance. The people picked to fill these seats will have a tremendous effect on the trajectory of our future as a country.Gohmert closes his statement by making it clear the importance of not allowing Hillary Clinton to fill these seats on the court. ""If Hillary is elected, the Supreme Court decision declaring a Constitutional right for an American to own a gun in a 5 to 4 decision, will go the other way. So will many other cases that protected our religious and speech freedoms.""In his days as a Democrat funder and his friendship with Bill Clinton, Donald Trump's language was extremely inappropriate, even though Barrack Obama can be seen on video using the same exact language.

On the one hand, that is both an irresponsible statement, and also a potentially self-destructive one. On the other hand, it may be true.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIt is irresponsible to claim the election is ""rigged"" for the reason most of Trump's media critics have suggested -- namely, that by casting the result as illegitimate, Trump is ensuring it will be harder to unify the country afterwards.Moreover, it is politically questionable to call an election ""rigged"" while it is still ongoing, because it suggests the candidate making that statement expects to lose. Alternatively, declaring an election ""rigged"" could be a way of motivating supporters to flock to the polls: that is how Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu mobilized support in 2015, when he warned that foreign-funded organizations were frantically busing Arab voters to the polls. (He later apologized -- after he won, of course.)As a factual matter, it is impossible to know whether the election result on November 8 will be ""rigged"" -- that is, if it will be affected by ballot-stuffing, hacking, voter fraud, and so on. Past experience suggests that fraud does have an effect -- just ask former Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman how he lost to Al Franken in 2008 -- but given the sheer variety of jurisdictions that run a typical presidential election, the nationwide effect of voter fraud may be much harder to measure, and probably small.What we do know is that important parts of the election have, in fact, been ""rigged,"" both in the literal and figurative sense. The Democratic Party primary was certainly rigged against Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), both openly and secretly: openly, in the sense that the Democrats' undemocratic superdelegate system is designed to thwart insurgent candidacies; secretly, in that the Democratic National Committee and parts of the media were colluding with Hillary Clinton, as revealed by Wikileaks.More broadly, the election has been ""rigged"" because of the brazen corruption of the nation's system of law enforcement, such that Hillary Clinton evaded prosecution for mis-handling classified information and destroying government documents -- acts that would have landed anyone else in prison. What occurred behind the scenes in 2012, when the IRS silenced conservative non-profit groups, has occurred in the open in 2016: the partisan abuse of the state apparatus of law enforcement (and intelligence, if the reports of ""Russian"" hacking are unfounded).Were the United States a third-world country, international monitors would report the FBI's sham investigation and the Justice Department's cozy arrangement with the Clinton family as signs that the election that followed would be neither free nor fair.Republican voters, at least, feel that the election is being ""rigged"" in the sense that the media are hell-bent on destroying their candidate. That is not, properly speaking, how an election is ""rigged."" The media are generally private actors, even when they are pro-government. And there are alternative media, such as Breitbart News and others, that provide a counterweight to the twisted mainstream.Moreover, the media are always against the Republican Party and its candidates, even if they are more openly so in 2016 than they have ever been before. If this election is ""rigged,"" then so are the many past elections -- most recently, 2014 -- when the media tried to sway the result in favor of the Democrats and failed.But what feels wrong to many Republican voters is that the slew of sexual allegations against Trump have arrived so late in the process. All of the accusations are many years, and even decades, old. There was no reason to withhold them during the Republican Party primary, when voters could have chosen an alternative.And so many Republicans feel the media is trying to nullify their votes. To them, the election is indeed being ""rigged,"" albeit legally.Luckily, they still have a chance to respond.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.
