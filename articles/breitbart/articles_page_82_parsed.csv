Was … An Arm of the Clinton Foundation’	"""The more that comes out, the clearer it is that the Clinton State Department was for all intents and purposes an arm of the Clinton Foundation,"" declares Donald Trump's senior communications adviser, Jason Miller.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""The fact that Hillary Clinton was handing out government contracts to family friends, siding with Clinton Foundation donors over human rights activists in Burma and having her aides coordinate activity between the State Department and her foundation is deeply troubling,"" Miller continued.""A Clinton White House would be more of the same but worse: the highest office in the land would be brimming with corruption and compromised by undue foreign influence.""Miller was responding to an article by Betsy Woodruff published at the Daily Beast on Thursday afternoon, in which it was revealed that Clinton Foundation donors wanted Hillary Clinton's State Department to open Burma to U.S. business interests, and ""they got what they wanted.""The opening to Burma was a matter of public record, announced by Secretary of State Clinton in May 2012. It was ostensibly justified by the once-isolated state's movement toward democracy, particularly the election of formerly persecuted dissident and Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi to the presidency.However, human-rights activists worried that opening Burma up to U.S. investment would set back their cause by empowering the military faction, known as the Tatmadaw, and making the wealth gap between average Burmese and their corrupt oligarchs even worse. Also, activists did not want to relieve the economic pressure on the Burmese government until vital reforms were made.Suu Kyi herself ""supported a partial easing of the U.S. investment ban, but didn't want American companies to be able to invest in the country's energy sector.""But U.S. investment in the energy sector was authorized by Clinton - just like ""energy conglomerate Chevron and other generous donors to the Clinton Foundation wanted."" Burma was one of Chevron's top lobbyist concerns at the time.Those other generous Clinton Foundation donors, according to the Daily Beast's research, included ""Calvin Klein, General Motors, Boeing, ConocoPhillips, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Gap, General Electric, Microsoft, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble.""Many of those entities are also members of the National Foreign Trade Council and US-ASEAN Business Council, two groups very eager for sanctions on Burma to be rolled back.As an extra little bonus, Clinton singled out three Clinton Foundation donors - Boeing, Chevron, and General Motors - for praise during a November 2012 trade mission to Burma.According to human rights activists quoted by the Daily Beast, the fears of those opposed to lifting Burma sanctions have come to pass, as the Clinton Foundation donors made a bundle, the Burmese people got very little, and the persecuted Rohingya, a Muslim minority group, have it worse than ever.The Tatmadaw is still using rape and ethnic cleansing as weapons, and its critics worry that the deals facilitated by Clinton will continue providing it with much-desired hard currency.The Daily Beast cites an October 2015 paper by the International Trade Union Confederation that noted ""underage labor is still common in the country, including in the oil and mining industries----industries which have attracted Western investment."" Foreign investment is also said to be making land confiscation and violence against minority groups worse.Miller's charge that SecState Clinton was ""handing out government contracts to family friends"" refers to the Washington Free Beacon's Thursday expose on Jacqueline Newmyer Deal, who has a defense consulting firm called the Long Term Strategy Group, and just happens to be a close friend of Chelsea Clinton.Among the vast trove of emails Hillary Clinton hid from the American people were conversations that showed Clinton arranging meetings between Deal's consulting firm and Pentagon officials involved in handing out contracts. Clinton specifically tried to help Deal ""win a contract for consulting work with the State Department's director of policy planning,"" in Free Beacon writer Bill Gertz's reading of the newly uncovered emails.""Government cronyism, or the use of senior positions to help family friends, is not illegal. However, the practice appears to violate federal ethics rules that prohibit partiality, or creating the appearance of conflicts of interest,"" Gertz pointed out.""By now there is a strong pattern of Hillary Clinton showing bias in the dispensing of government funds and favors to a long list of friends, political supporters, and Clinton Foundation donors,"" Ken Boehm of the National Legal and Policy Center told the Free Beacon. ""It looks like she was single-handedly trying to revive the corrupt spoils system. As the old saying goes, sometimes things are what they look like.""The Trump campaign also spotlighted a Washington Examiner article on the ""intersection"" of the Clinton Foundation, the State Department, and those unbelievably expensive speeches Bill Clinton was fond of giving.The thrust of this article is that Hillary Clinton's State Department staff spent a great deal of their time working with the Clinton Foundation to ""perform donor maintenance, craft messaging on key policies and put together guest lists for both diplomatic and philanthropic events,"" as well as helping Mr. Clinton with advice on ""how to handle politically-fraught speaking engagements or foundation events.""One such event involved bringing the new president of Libya to a Clinton Global Initiative meeting less than two weeks after the Benghazi atrocity. Things don't get much more ""fraught"" than that.The Examiner notes that Clinton's ability to hide her emails, and turn them over to courts, Congress, and watchdog groups very slowly, have unquestionably helped her minimize the political damage from these revelations.For example, we're only just seeing information highly relevant to the outrageous abuse of power that allowed Clinton aide Huma Abedin to work lucrative side jobs for Clinton cronies at the same time she was drawing a paycheck from the U.S. taxpayer as a State Department employee, even though her work arrangement has been a topic of controversy, and congressional interest, for years.Some of Hillary Clinton's secrets will be kept until after Election Day, as the Examiner notes ""at least a half-dozen Freedom of Information Act lawsuits for documents ranging from Bill Clinton's speech schedules to internal discussions of the Keystone Pipeline"" have been delayed until after November.SIGN UP"	['Clinton', 'Deal', 'Long', 'Trump']	[]

There was insufficient time to decide whether to grant or reject these requests before the next scheduled hearing next Monday.The spokesman added bluntly that he couldn't understand why prosecutors would employ a legal tactic that left them open to charges they had ""torpedoed the proceedings which they themselves had launched.""The charges against Zafke focus on a one-month period in 1944 when 14 trains carrying prisoners -- including the teenage diarist Anne Frank -- arrived at Auschwitz-Birkenau.Frank, who arrived in Auschwitz with her parents and sister, was later transferred to another camp, Bergen-Belsen, where she died in March 1945, just two months before the Nazis were defeated.Thursday's announcement marked the end of a case that had been marred by five delays and at times deteriorated into farce, increasingly frustrating victims' lawyers.The International Auschwitz Committee, which represents Holocaust survivors, had sharply attacked Germany's handling of the case, saying the court was hurtling ""between sloppy ignorance and complete disinterest"" in a resolution.Some 1.1 million people, most of them European Jews, perished between 1940 and 1945 in Auschwitz before it was liberated by Soviet forces.More than 70 years after the prosecution of top Nazis began in Nuremberg, Germany has been racing against time to try the last Third Reich criminals.Zafke was the fourth former concentration camp worker in the dock in the latest series of trials, following John Demjanjuk in 2011, Oskar Groening in 2015 and Reinhold Hanning this May -- all convicted of complicity in mass murder.Those cases were hailed for providing a degree of catharsis for aged survivors, even if they shed little new light on the Holocaust.SIGN UP"	[]	[]

But the kingdom had the political will to protect children's rights, he said.The U.N. experts voiced deep concern that Riyadh ""still does not recognise girls as full subjects of rights and continues to severely discriminate (against) them in law and practice and to impose on them a system of male guardianship"".Traditional, religious or cultural attitudes should not be used to justify violations of their right to equality, they said.Children of Shi'ite Muslim families and other religious minorities are persistently discriminated against in their access to schools and justice in the Sunni-ruled kingdom, they said.Children over 15 years are tried as adults and can be executed, ""after trials falling short of guarantees of due process and a fair trial"", the report said.Out of 47 people executed on Jan. 2, 2016 - the biggest mass execution for security offences in decades, that included a prominent Shi'ite cleric, at least four were under 18 when sentenced to death, it said.The experts urged Saudi authorities to ""repeal all provisions contained in legislation which authorise the stoning, amputation and flogging of children"".Saudi Arabia should ""unambiguously prohibit the use of solitary confinement, life sentences on children and child attendance of public execution"".All forms of sexual abuse against children should be a crime and perpetrators prosecuted, the experts said.They cited the case of Muslim preacher Fayhan al-Ghamdi, saying his charges were reduced and he was released from jail ""after having raped, tortured and killed his five-year-old daughter"" in 2012.SIGN UP"	[]	[]

He said Abbas went through a number of routine tests, including a cardiac catheterization, a procedure that can detect and treat heart problems, and that everything looked normal.""His arteries look great, and there is no need for him to stay in the hospital,"" al-Batrawi said.Several hours later, Abbas walked out of the hospital, waving to well-wishers.Abbas did not comment when asked by reporters how he felt. But shortly before leaving the hospital, he told state-run Palestine TV that everything had gone well.""I had a catheterization. Everything is OK,"" he said. ""I leave the hospital with good health. Thanks to the medical team of the hospital.""Abbas, who has a history of health issues, was elected president in 2005 for what was supposed to be a four-year term. But in 2007 the rival Hamas militant group seized control of the Gaza Strip, and Abbas has remained in power.The Palestinians are now divided between two governments, Abbas's Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and the Hamas government in Gaza. Attempts at reconciliation have repeatedly failed, and this week the Palestinians called off plans to hold municipal elections in the two territories.Abbas, who is a heavy smoker and is overweight, was treated years ago with prostate cancer and has had a stent inserted to treat artery blockage.He also is under great pressure as his popularity has plummeted. The Palestinian public is frustrated over years of failed peace efforts with Israel. Over the past week, he also has come under heavy criticism at home for attending the funeral of the late Israeli president, Shimon Peres.Over the years, Abbas has ignored calls to appoint a successor, setting the stage for a bitter power struggle if he is incapacitated.A long list of senior officials and security chiefs would likely covet the job, though there is no clear front-runner. Perhaps the most popular potential successor, Marwan Barghouti, is serving multiple life sentences in an Israeli prison for his role in deadly attacks on Israelis. Hamas would also likely demand a say in choosing a new leader. Hamas had no immediate comment Thursday.Even choosing a caretaker leader ahead of future elections will be a difficult task. Under Palestinian law, the parliament speaker is supposed to take over if the president is incapacitated or dies. But the current speaker, Aziz Dweik, is a member of Hamas.Abbas's Fatah party has argued that since parliament has not functioned in nearly a decade, Dweik would not be eligible to lead the Palestinians.SIGN UP"	['Israel']	[]

It restricts Tehran's nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions against the Islamic Republic.""The implementation of the agreement is still fragile,"" International Atomic Energy Agency chief Yukiya Amano said in an interview with the German news agency DPA published on Friday before a trip to Germany.""Small technical mistakes, small failures in implementation can become big political issues that could have a large negative influence on the agreement,"" he added.Amano's agency has reported that Iran so far has stayed within the terms of the agreement. Those include limits on its stockpile of enriched uranium and the number of its centrifuges, machines that enrich uranium, it has installed.Iran has also complained that the United States is not keeping its side of the deal. It wants Washington to do more to encourage banks to do business with Iran. Many are wary that doing so would run afoul of U.S. sanctions still in place.Earlier this week, the speaker of the Iranian parliament canceled talks with German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel intended to improve Germany's trade ties with Iran. The speaker, Ali Larijani, gave no reason, but the cancellation came after Gabriel urged Iran to pursue reforms and work for a cease fire in Syria, where Tehran supports President Bashar al-Assad.The Republican candidate for U.S. president, Donald Trump, has strongly criticized the deal, though he has also conceded that it would be hard to tear it up as he had previously said he would.The United States says it has done everything required by the agreement, which was also signed by Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany.""There is little trust,"" Amano said, referring to the United States and Iran.SIGN UP"	[]	[]

""Taking over the capital isn't the most important thing. A capital city is a Western concept, and the importance attributed to it is part of the modern conception of a state.""We don't need a state that has a seat in the United Nations, because it has artificial boundaries, while the Islamic state, the Islamic home, has to be portable, flexible and unbound by frontiers. The state, or the house, could govern at night and disappear during the day. That's what the Taliban do.""Abu Katada added that fixed boundaries play into the hands of the enemy.""The Mujahideen need to square the circle, the state appears and disappears, governs at night and disappears during the day, the most important thing is to prevent the enemy from taking it over even if he invaded. We may not control some parts of the state, but it's paramount that we have the ability to hurt the enemy and prevent him from gaining a foothold on the ground.""Abu Katada, who spent some years in a British prison for incitement to terror, said that the state ""should not conform to Western standards, like those of the UN, the Arab League, the World Bank or the International Court of Justice. That would turn it into another Western state, and not an Islamic state that is governed according to God's criteria.""""The modern state needs a capital city, international recognition, a currency, and I'm afraid some Islamic organizations are seduced by these,"" he said. ""The Islamic state or home don't need a capital city, they can exist in a small town or village, it doesn't need representation in the UN General Assembly nor does it need borders.

The Obama administration, for example, was heavily invested in the peace deal as part of its outreach to the Castro regime; Kerry even witnessed the signing of the deal last month.In the U.S., one of the few voices against the deal was Wall Street Journal columnist Mary Anastasia O'Grady, who warned that the deal was ""practically a surrender"":The deal gives the FARC amnesty for its war crimes, which include the recruitment of thousands of child soldiers, massacres of villages, political executions, bombings and kidnappings.Under the agreement, negotiated and signed in Havana, the FARC will also get unelected seats in Congress and special welfare benefits. It will be given dozens of radio stations--so that it can disseminate its propaganda, a privilege no other political party has.The agreement does not require the FARC to pay any financial reparations to its victims, even though the narco-terrorist kingpins have wealth estimated in the billions. Reparations will be paid by law-abiding citizens via sharp tax increases. The FARC says it will not disarm until it's good and ready to. Meanwhile it will be given weapons and training to enforce the agreement.Colombians were also angry that President Juan Manuel Santos had taken the peace agreement to the United Nations before securing the support of the people. He declared to the UN General Assembly last month: ""I return to the United Nations today, on the International Day of Peace, to announce with all the strength of my voice and my heart, that the war in Colombia has ended."" (Update: Santos won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday.)Yet there are two ways to end a war -- through victory, or surrender. Colombians rejected the latter.O'Grady notes that the Colombian government resorted to a variety of illiberal methods to campaign for the peace deal, such as promising to spend government funds in areas that voted ""yes."" The government also warned that voting ""no"" meant returning to war.Never mind that the last Colombian president, Alvaro Uribe, had pushed FARC back on the battlefield, and that the rebels were weakened as a result. His successor gave those hard-fought gains away for nothing.Now the Colombian government will return to the negotiating table -- strengthened, ironically, by the fact that the people have rejected more lenient terms brokered under Havana's watchful eye. The cease-fire with FARC could end on October 31, but the people of Colombia have faced that risk, and decided that the price of an illusory peace was even heavier.Theirs was an extraordinarily brave decision -- especially since the regions closest to the fighting led the nation in voting ""no.""The Colombian people were able to exercise a choice that the American people never had when it came to the Iran deal. A new Breitbart/Gravis poll released this week confirms that the voters still reject the deal.Americans know Iran has no desire for peace, that the agreement allows Iran to continue its nuclear weapons program in future years, and that the regime will cheat. Americans have consistently rejected the deal -- along with its grotesque side deals, including ransoms for hostages.The Constitution requires that all treaties be ratified by a two-thirds vote in the Senate. So the Obama administration, knowing that the Senate would reject the pathetically weak terms to which it had agreed, called the Iran deal an ""executive agreement,""Then Congress spoke up with the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, demanding the power to reject the deal -- while lowering the threshold for approval to an effective one-third of either house, (which is why Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) voted against it). That wasn't good enough for President Barack Obama, who took the deal to the UN Security Council first, then presented Congress with a fait accompli and dared it to risk war.In the end, Democrats filibustered, and there was no vote. The first time the American electorate will have a chance to speak out about the Iran deal is in the 2016 presidential election.Both Santos and Obama sought to appease terrorism, using the UN for leverage against their own people. The big difference is that Santos submitted his agreement to the voters, recognizing their sovereignty. Obama did not have the decency to do that, despite the clear intent of the Framers of the Constitution that the people, through Congress, would decide war and peace.The recent Brexit vote did not quite involve life and death, but saw a similar pattern, where the ""remain"" campaign tried to use fears of economic collapse, and international leverage, to quash the voters' desire for greater sovereignty over Britain's borders and economic affairs.When treaties and transnational institutions are abused in such anti-democratic fashion, it is no surprise globalization has few defenders left, even though the benefits of (real) peace, and (truly) free trade, are elementary.From Brexit, to the Iran deal, to ""peace"" with FARC, voters have been warned that rejecting the poor terms negotiated by their feckless leaders would mean disaster.The British and Colombian voters have spoken, bravely. Now, finally, Americans will have a turn.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Under the agreement, negotiated and signed in Havana, the FARC will also get unelected seats in Congress and special welfare benefits. It will be given dozens of radio stations--so that it can disseminate its propaganda, a privilege no other political party has.
The agreement does not require the FARC to pay any financial reparations to its victims, even though the narco-terrorist kingpins have wealth estimated in the billions. Reparations will be paid by law-abiding citizens via sharp tax increases. The FARC says it will not disarm until it's good and ready to. Meanwhile it will be given weapons and training to enforce the agreement.var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([""embed""]);SIGN UP"	['Obama', 'Castro', 'Cotton']	[]

Other big hurricanes in the past tended to roar across Florida in a four-hour period. But the slow-moving Mathew could take 60 hours to reach the Georgia border. The storm is then expected to trash the Mid-Atlantic coast at a leisurely pace, up to at least North Carolina.Total U.S. natural disaster insurance losses hit 16.1 billion in 2015, up from $15.3 billion in 2014, according to Munich Re. Last year's major losses included: $9.6 billion from severe thunderstorms; $3.5 billion from winter storms and cold waves; and $1.9 billion from wildfires, heat waves and drought.The U.S. National Weather Service warned that Hurricane Matthew is not only packing Category 4 winds, but also brings up to 25 foot waves, a 9-12 foot storm surge, and 40 inches of rain in some spots. The horrific combination will cause deaths, wash out roads, and cut communication links and cause outages for several weeks.Chuck Watson, disaster modeler with Enki Research in Savannah, Georgia told the Insurance Journal that the record number of emergency evacuations will cause an immense amount of business interruption insurance claims, with at least 1 million people temporarily displaced.The storm path will hit at least twelve U.S. power generators, including two nuclear plants, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nuclear operators NextEra Energy and Duke Energy Corp. have already shut their reactors. Florida Power & Light utility, the largest electric utility in Florida, estimates that up to 1.2 million customers could lose power.Although it is early in the recovery effort, there are already 261 confirmed deaths and 3,200 homes destroyed in Hurricane Matthew's strike on Haiti.

He had already issued states of emergency for Florida and South Carolina.Matthew is about 125 miles (200 kilometers) southeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida, and moving northwest at 13 mph (20 kph).Florida Power and Light reports that about 95,000 customers -- about 42,000 in Palm Beach County alone -- are already without electricity.9:30 p.m.Officials say winds are picking up and thousands are without power in Florida as Hurricane Matthew approaches.The National Hurricane Center says the eye of Matthew is northwest of Grand Bahama Island, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) east of West Palm Beach, Florida, and a wind gust of 50 mph (80 kph) has been recorded at Palm Beach International Airport.Florida Power and Light says more than 30,000 customers -- about 24,000 in Palm Beach County alone -- are already without electricity.Matthew is still a Category 4 storm with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (210 kph). It is moving northwest at 13 mph (20 kph).9:10 p.m.The coordinator for Haiti's Interior Ministry in the area hit hardest by Hurricane Matthew says the confirmed death toll in that southwestern zone is now 283.Emmanuel Pierre told The Associated Press late Thursday that he expects the toll to rise as authorities reach remote places that were left isolated by the storm.The overall death toll in Haiti is not clear. Shortly before Pierre spoke, the headquarters for Haiti's Civil Protection Agency had put the number of confirmed deaths for the whole country at 122.Bodies have started to appear as waters recede in some areas two days after Matthew smashed concrete walls, flattened palm trees and tore roofs off homes.___8:30 p.m.Florida Gov. Rick Scott maintains that state and local officials are prepared for Hurricane Matthew, even as he called the storm bearing down on the state a ""monster.""""Matthew is likely to produce devastating impacts,"" Scott says.Scott says people in the northeast part of the state still have time to evacuate and residents could still choose to go to a shelter.Authorities have told roughly 1.5 million people across the state to evacuate. The mass exodus led to crammed highways, full hotels and the need to open dozens of hurricane shelters. The looming storm also has led to gas shortages, though Scott said the state still has five days' worth of fuel supplies.Officials are expecting massive power outages across the region once Hurricane Matthew hits full-force.Although the state has food and water supplies ready for after the storm, Scott cautioned that people need to be able to take care of themselves for the first three days.8:10 p.m.The National Hurricane Center says the center of Hurricane Matthew is over the western end of the Grand Bahama Island and tropical storm conditions are lashing the east coast of Florida.At 8 p.m. EDT, the storm had weakened slightly and had 130 mph (210 kph) sustained winds, down from 140 mph (225 kph). Matthew is about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of West Palm Beach, Florida.The storm left more than 100 dead in its wake across the Caribbean, and 2 million people across the Southeast have been warned to flee inland.It's the most powerful storm to threaten the U.S. Atlantic coast in more than a decade.SIGN UP"	['Obama']	[]

They disappeared while participating in U.S.-based training programs, including eight since last month alone, Reuters has learned from the Pentagon.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""The Defense Department is assessing ways to strengthen eligibility criteria for training in ways that will reduce the likelihood of an individual Afghan willingly absconding from training in the U.S. and going AWOL (absent without leave),"" Adam Stump, a Pentagon spokesman who revealed how many ANDSF troops have gone missing, told Reuters.Although other foreign troops have disappeared while training in the United States, an unnamed U.S. defense official told Reuters the frequency of ANDSF members running away was concerning and ""out of the ordinary.""According to the official, ""there was no evidence any of those who had absconded had carried out crimes or posed a threat to the United States.""In January 2015, an Afghan soldier was granted asylum and allowed to remain in the United States despite having absconded and apprehended trying to sneak into Canada.Afghan troops have gone missing on U.S. soil ""presumably in an effort to live and work illegally in America,"" notes Reuters, citing the Pentagon.The Afghan service member who was granted asylum was one of five ANDSF officers -- two policemen and three soldiers -- who went missing in September 2014 while participating in separate U.S.-based training programs.Eventually, the two policemen were found right outside of Washington D.C., and the military officers were apprehended while trying to sneak across the Canadian border.Reuters reports:The military training program brings troops to the United States from around the world in order to build on military relations and improve capabilities for joint operations.In some cases, officials said, the Afghan students who went missing were in the United States for elite Army Ranger School and intelligence-gathering training. The officials did not identify the missing troops or their rank.Local and federal authorities, particularly the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), have been involved in efforts to locate the missing Afghans after they are reported missing.""Even though the troops were in the United States for military training, they were not necessarily always on a military base,"" reports Reuters.""If students under the military program are absent from training for more than 24 hours, they are considered to be 'absent without leave' (AWOL) and the Department of Homeland Security is notified,"" it adds.The Pentagon spokesman explained that ""Afghans in the U.S. training program are vetted to ensure they have not participated in human rights abuses and are not affiliated with militant groups before being allowed into the United States.""Taliban jihadists and other terrorists have occasionally infiltrated the Afghan army. Some of the infiltrators have carried out attacks on Afghan and U.S. forces.However, such insider attacks, officially known green on blue attacks, ""have become less frequent due to tougher security measures,"" notes Reuters.The news outlet adds:Although the number of disappearances is relatively small -- some 2,200 Afghan troops have received military training in the United States since 2007 -- the incidents raise questions about security and screening procedures for the programs.They are also potentially embarrassing for U.S. President Barack Obama's administration, which has spent billions of dollars training Afghan troops as Washington seeks to extricate itself from the costly, 15-year-old war. The disclosure could fuel criticism by supporters of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has accused the Obama administration of failing to properly vet immigrants from Muslim-majority countries and has pledged a much tougher stance if he wins.Since the Afghanistan war started in October 2001, the U.S. has invested nearly $70 billion on training and developing the ANDSF.Nevertheless, the Afghan troops continue to face capability gaps. The Taliban currently controls more territory than at any time since it was dethroned in 2001.Tens of thousands of Afghans have been admitted into the U.S. legally in the wake of the ongoing 15-year-old war in their country.More than 31,000 Afghans have resettled in the United States as refugees, asylees, or special immigrant visa recipients since President Barack Obama escalated the conflict soon after taking office in 2009.According to a Breitbart News tally gleaned from federal data released under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), at least four Afghans have been apprehended trying to sneak into the United States across the U.S.-Mexico border.""Experts said low morale and insufficient training to fight the Taliban could explain the troops leaving, in addition to a dearth of economic opportunities in the impoverished country,"" reports Reuters.The military training program brings troops to the United States from around the world in order to build on military relations and improve capabilities for joint operations.

Carlin on Thursday, Rep. John Culberson (R-TX) asked the DOJ to review and update the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) in response to a significant rise in Chinese investment in Hollywood.In his letter, Culberson specifically cites the Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda's acquisition of AMC Cinemas and Legendary Entertainment in the U.S. and its bid for Carmike Cinemas, along with Hunan TV's investment in Lionsgate.Wanda acquired Legendary -- the studio behind such films as Jurassic World and Godzilla -- for $3.5 billion in January, and purchased a majority stake in AMC in May 2012 for $2.6 billion in cash.Culberson warned that the multi-billion dollar acquisitions ""allow Chinese state-controlled companies a significant degree of control over the financing and content of American media that raises serious concerns about how this may be used for propaganda purposes.""Gerry Lopez, CEO of AMC Entertainment Holdings, left, shakes hands with Zhang Lin, Vice President of Wanda during a signing ceremony for Dalian Wanda Group Co. to acquire AMC Entertainment Holdings in Beijing, China, Monday, May 21, 2012. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)Culberson praised the DOJ in his letter for its warm reception of an Inspector General's audit of FARA which was published in September. The report recommended 14 changes to FARA -- which was first implemented in 1938 in response to fears of Soviet or Nazi propaganda infiltration in America -- to bring the regulations up to date, after its last review in 1990.The lawmaker also cited a report released by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission last October that found, according to Culberson, a number of ""troubling examples of how agents of the Chinese Communist Party are exerting control of American movie content, both through direct ownership of studios and distribution as well as through coerced cooperation"" with Chinese government censorship agencies.Culberson went on to call attention to Wanda CEO Wang Jianlin, whom he says ""does not try to hide his close relationship with the Chinese government."" The congressman said the DOJ would need to update FARA to address ""new threats.""""If, in fact, the law in its current form no longer effectively addresses these concerns, I urge you to provide legislative options Congress may consider to ensure transparency, full disclosure, and to mitigate this type of foreign propaganda influence over American media, which shapes not only the opinions of many within the U.S. but remains one of our biggest cultural exports to nations around the world,"" Culberson concluded his letter.The Texas lawmaker was one of 16 Congress members who last month asked the GAO to determine whether existing U.S. law had kept pace with rising foreign acquisitions in the U.S. and particularly in the entertainment industry. The lawmakers' letter to the GAO had also cited Wanda's purchase of AMC Theaters and Legendary Entertainment. The GAO agreed to review the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States in response to the lawmakers' petition.Culberson's letter comes after the Washington Post editorial board on Wednesday night questioned Wanda's interest in a billion-dollar acquisition of the U.S.-based Dick Clark Productions, which produces awards shows including the Golden Globes and the American Music Awards.""It is not far-fetched to assume that China would seek to spread pro-regime propaganda via ownership of U.S. entertainment media,"" the paper's editorial board wrote.Read Culberson's full letter to the DOJ here.

""But his decision to drag us into this campaign and mischaracterize and paint a very distorted caricature of Chicago is a mistake and we reserve these honorary street signs for special Chicagoans who have lifted up this city and move us forward.""Chicago mayor and one-time chief of staff for Barack Obama Rahm Emanuel jumped on the bandwagon to push the proposal through the city council.""We'll put the sign back up when he releases his tax returns,"" Emanuel told reporters.Mayor Emanuel, a big backer of Hillary Clinton and brother to Ezekiel Emanuel, one of the president's Obamacare architects, added that he not only wanted to take the Trump street sign down but hoped to use the discussion to get out the vote for Hillary.Emanuel has also criticized Trump for using Chicago as an example of the bad policies infesting America's Democrat-controlled big cities. In August the mayor slammed Trump for using Chicago in his stump speeches merely to play ""a political game.""""He's got an election, he's not interested in Chicago,"" Emanuel said when asked to respond to Trump's criticism.But both Alderman Reilly and Mayor Emanuel have in the past been the happy recipients of large cash donations from the GOP nominee. During the time Trump's Chicago tower was being built in the city Reilly received up to $5,500 and Emanuel has received $50,000 from Trump.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.SIGN UP"	['Obama', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Warner']	[]

Here's how you can help in Haiti,"" Clinton said his tweet, which linked to a Medium article, entitled, ""Members of the Clinton Foundation Community Respond to Hurricane Matthew; Ways to Support.""The last time tragedy struct the tiny Caribbean country, Bill and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton -- according to scores of enraged Haitians -- used their billion dollar charity and leveraged their global connections to enrich themselves and their monied cronies.Following the devastating earthquake in Haiti in 2010 -- while 316,000 lifeless bodies lay buried under rubble, and while 300,000 Haitians suffered from injuries, with another 1.3 million displaced -- the Clintons saw an opportunity to cash in.Hillary Clinton's brother, Tony Rodham, landed a lucrative and historically rare Haitian ""gold exploitation permit,"" while Clinton Foundation donors, including Digicel mobile phone company founder Denis O'Brien, were winning multi-million dollar contracts that would siphon massive profits from the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.While then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's State Department was funneling billions in relief funds to rebuild Haiti, the Clinton Foundation was leveraging its influence to guide high-dollar contracts to longtime Clinton cronies who would go on to reap millions off the catastrophe that had claimed so many lives on the devastated island.""I deal through the Clinton Foundation,"" Tony Rodham said according to a transcript of his testimony during court proceedings, obtained by The New York Times. ""That gets me in touch with the Haitian officials. I hound my brother-in-law [Bill Clinton], because it's his fund that we're going to get our money from. And he can't do it until the Haitian government does it.""The anger at the Clintons from the Haitian people is no secret.Indeed, dozens of Haitian protesters gathered outside the Democrat National Convention in July and railed against the Clintons and the Clinton Foundation for their long-reported history of using their global connections to exploit the resources and the poor people of Haiti.""The main message is that Hillary Clinton belongs in jail,"" one protester said at the time when asked what the overall message of the protest was. ""We believe that the world should know about the crimes the Clinton family has committed against the country of Haiti-the money they have stolen from the earthquake victims. And we believe that were this to be anyone else, they'd be in jail right now.""""She's not in jail because she's being protected by the Obama administration, the Justice Department, State Department,"" the protester said.Bill Clinton's tweet, urging support for Haiti, smacks of irony, and Twitter followers took notice.""Clintons still scamming off poor Haiti after a natural disaster ,"" one user wrote.""Do u realize what the Clinton Foundation did to Haiti?"" another Twitter user asked.His question was quickly answered by another user, who said, ""Practically stole 6 billion promising hospitals/homes to rebuild Haiti?""""More like literally,"" another user said.""There it is, Clinton's looking to fill their bank accounts off another natural disaster,"" another user remarked.As Breitbart News reported, Haitians have been protesting the Clintons for years for their transgressions against the tiny island nation.Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudsonSIGN UP"	['Hudson', 'Clinton', 'Obama']	[]

Rick Scott and others should move the deadline past Tuesday so voters in the critical battleground state could register to participate in November's election in time while also staying safe as the storm that has already killed more than 100 in Haiti bears down.
Story Continued BelowThe request came as Mook was explaining the importance of early voting, particularly in Florida, to Clinton's White House bid.Storms have played a role in previous elections. In 2012, Hurricane Sandy made landfall in New Jersey a week before Election Day. Voting procedures were affected in New Jersey and New York; more importantly, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie praised President Barack Obama's response to the storm, and embraced him on a special presidential visit to the state. Ironically, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo had declined a presidential visit out of concern that it would be too disruptive.The presidential candidates have been neck-and-neck in Florida polls over the past several weeks. The infamous 2000 recount made clear how close the partisan balance is in a state that has 29 electoral votes, tied with New York for the third-highest of any state.Mook's request for an extension to fit the Clinton campaign's plans recalls then-Vice President Al Gore's request for a partial recount of Florida votes in 2000, focusing only on counties where Democrats were strongest.Joel B.

Musk hilariously commented at the conference, ""I'd like to die on Mars, just not on impact.""Musk outlined that SpaceX would soon unveil a powerful reusable rocket system called the Interplanetary Transport System (ITS), which can carry a 100-person working crew to the ""Red Planet"" to set up permanent extraterrestrial colonies, factories and mines.Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, speaking at an early October conference in Chicago, said his company was joining the land rush, and that he is ""convinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket,"" according to Bloomberg.Boeing unveiled its heavy-lift rocket project, called the Space Launch System, which also aims to develop reusable rocket systems. Many aspects of Boeing's plan appear similar to SpaceX, but Muilenburg commented that his plan is a more realistic approach because it will rely on at least $60 billion in private sector satellite launches and NASA-funded development prior to a human-crewed venture to Mars in the late 2030s.NASA has essentially been operating as a joint venture in space travel with the Russians since the July 17, 1975 ""rendezvous between the Soyuz and Apollo spacecrafts proved that the Soviet Union and the United States could set aside their differences in the name of advancing manned spaceflight,"" according to Stratfor Global Intelligence.The partnership allowed Washington to curtail drastically its very expansive NASA budgets, which at the height of the Apollo program accounted for 4.2 percent of all federal budget spending. Today, that budget is less than one-half percent of federal spending.As NASA's budget declined, the U.S. space agency also struck partnership deals with other nations and the private sector to help finance research efforts. Although the U.S. continued to pay most of the cost of the International Space Station, the U.S. gained benefits, sharing the expenses with others.Historically, manned space flight has been mostly about basic research, and had few military applications. A few experiments could only be conducted in zero atmosphere, but there is no advantage to putting military special forces in space. Remote satellites are far superior to manned spacecraft for reconnaissance and imaging programs.But with the U.S. once again becoming a military and policy adversary on the world stage to the Russians and the Chinese, the importance of space as the ultimate high ground in terrestrial warfare is becoming more obvious, according to Stratfor.The U.S. has always banned Chinese scientists from working with their NASA counterparts because of national security concerns. The International Space Station required all participating nations to hand over technical information and make their hardware freely accessible to anyone involved in the program, a step China has refused to take.China, with the help of Russia, launched its second space lab into orbit in September as a preparatory step to a permanent space station in the 2020s. Russia has recently announced that it intends to separate their portion of the International Space Station modules in 2024, and then build their own outpost, or partner with the Chinese.China and Russia are focused on colonization and economic exploitation of the moon. Beijing plans to follow the model of its One Belt, One Road strategy of using economic projects and partnerships to gain political support abroad, particularly in the developing world. Moscow's space strategy is focused on military projects and the projection of power.But NASA and the Obama administration are squarely focused on reaching the Red Planet, and will let private sector companies grab Mars as the ultimate resource platform.SIGN UP"	['Obama']	[]
