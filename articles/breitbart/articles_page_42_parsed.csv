After all, the Bureau gave most of the suspects immunity and even destroyed much of the evidence in the original case.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERWhen news broke about the results of the FBI's first investigation into Hillary's email scandal, Director James Comey concluded ""no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case"" and decided not to recommend to the Department of Justice to indict the former Secretary of State for her violations of national security laws. But even as Comey decided there wasn't enough there to indict, it was also revealed that many of Hillary's aides were given immunity and the FBI destroyed much of the evidence so it could never be used in any future case.One Hillary operative given immunity was top adviser Cheryl Mills.Mills was reportedly given immunity right before FBI investigators started looking through her computer for classified information. This despite Mills seeming never to have been awarded the security clearances necessary to have classified material on her personal devices in the first place.Not only was Mills excused from culpability by the FBI, the agency even agreed to physically destroy her laptop so that any illegally stored classified material would be forever eliminated from existence, out of the hands of future investigators.This same immunity deal was given to Hillary aide Heather Samuelson, an ex-campaign staffer and deputy to Mills.Beth Wilkinson, a Washington-based lawyer who is married to former Meet The Press host and Clinton donor David Gregory, negotiated these ""side agreements"" for Hillary's two former aides. In total, Wilkinson represented four of Clinton's top aides, helping them to skirt culpability in the FBI's investigation.The FBI and the Department of Justice also gave an immunity deal to the man who actually deleted thousands of Hillary's emails -- even after he was given a ""preserve evidence"" order from a congressional committee investigating Hillary's email scandal.It was revealed early in September that the FBI and the DOJ gave immunity to Paul Combetta, the man hired by Hillary to maintain the secret email server in her New York home.It was a deal heavily criticized by Representative Trey Gowdy (R-SC). Gowdy called the deal an act ""tantamount to giving the triggerman immunity in a robbery case.""Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions also criticized the FBI's move to destroy evidence.Early in October, the Alabamian pointed out that some of the laptops the FBI destroyed were under subpoena by Congress, but now that the evidence has been permanently, physically destroyed, congress will never be able to find out what was contained on those devices. Sessions called the FBI's behavior ""a breathtaking thing.""At the very least, the long list of immunity ""side agreements"" and the physically destroyed evidence should make further investigations harder, not easier.It appears that some of the evidence being considered in this ""re-opened"" investigation into Hillary's email scandal came from the investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations against Anthony Weiner, a former congressman and the husband of Hillary's top aide, Huma Abedin.According to The New York Times, the FBI discovered some of Hillary Clinton's emails on devices owned by Weiner as they investigated allegations of his sexual misconduct with a minor.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.SIGN UP"	['Gowdy', 'Paul', 'Clinton', 'Warner']	[]

Tim Kaine (D-VA) urged students at Florida State University to get to the polls before Election Day at a campus rally on Friday.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBefore a crowd of several hundred students at FSU's Oglesby Union State Ballroom -- cordoned off to make the audience appear more compact -- the Democratic vice-presidental nominee cited three reasons to vote early: potential Russian involvement in the election process, Trump's claim of election rigging and the difficulty of electing a woman to be president in the United States.""It's been a season of surprises,"" Kaine said. ""The polls have been wrong. The pundits have been wrong. We can't take it for granted. We can't take it for granted because we've never had an election with Russia or some other nation engaging in cyberattacks. How is that all going to shake out? I think we got a pretty good system but we can't take anything for granted.""Trump's response to the election results are among those things Democrats cannot take for granted, according to Kaine.""Donald Trump is trying to whine and complain and say it's all rigged,"" he continued. ""You know afterwards he is not going to accept responsibility if he loses. He's going to blame it all on our system or something. If we win and we win big, he can whine all he wants but other won't follow him.""Finally, Kaine argued, Clinton's gender is another reason her supporters should get to the polls early and not leave her election to chance.""The last reason we can't take it for granted is Hillary is trying to do something that's never been done,"" Kaine added. ""It's never been done. If it was easy for a woman to be president, then there would have been a woman president. The United States Congress - 19 percent are women. That's the most we've ever had. That makes us 75th in the world, below the global average ... We're bad at electing women to federal office. She was a trendsetter and a pathbreaker but as a nation, we're not good at this. And that means we can't take it for granted.""Kaine was joined by former NASA astronaut Mark Kelly and former Rep. Gabby Gifford's (D-AZ), both of who are Clinton supporters and gun control activists.Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly at Tallahassee Kaine RallyKaine's appearance comes as both candidates are doubling down on their focus on winning Florida's 29 electoral votes.""If Hillary Clinton wins Florida, Hillary Clinton will be president,"" Kaine told attendees.Clinton has a lead in most statewide polls. However, in recent days polling has started to trend in Trump's direction, including a Bloomberg News poll that has Trump ahead by two, but still within the margin of error.Kaine, however, has been hit or miss in the Sunshine State. Earlier in the week, Kaine hosted an event in West Palm Beach, FL that drew a very small crowd. And yesterday, the campaign cancelled an event the Democratic vice-presidential nominee had scheduled in Sarasota.In addition to urging early voting, Kaine delivered his usual stump speech -- laying out what he saw as five priorities for him and Clinton if they are elected: Jobs and small business, cost of college, climate change, equality and gun control.Kaine also made no mention of the FBI's decision to reopen the investigation into Clinton's email server.Friday was Kaine's second appearance in Florida's capitol city. Back in August, Kaine visited the city's Florida A&M University and made controversial remarks when he linked Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to ""Ku Klux Klan values.""Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poorSIGN UP"	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Kaine']	[]

In Part Two, we introduced our guest-expert, the Great Trustbuster himself, Theodore Roosevelt, who explained that the history of the Republican Party's antitrust policy is more complex than most people realize. Now, in Part Three, we will press Roosevelt for a specific opinion on the AT&T-Time Warner deal, and he will expand on his quantity-vs.-quality theory of regulation.  Virgil: Theodore, you have the floor.Theodore Roosevelt: Because everyone's busy, I will summarize the arguments I made about antitrust in my 1901 speech.  I said that rather than go off half-cocked, we should study the situation, gain a maximum understanding of business dealings, and then and only then formulate a plan. To use a nautical analogy, the wise ship-captain must have good charts before he lifts anchor. V: Indeed, you published a book of sea-going military history, The Naval War of 1812, when you were 23 years old--and it's still in print today.  Impressive! TR: Thank you.  My understanding of naval history helped me a lot when I was Assistant Secretary of the Navy--V: --back when there was a grand total of one Assistant Secretary of the Navy. TR: Right.  As Sir Francis Bacon said at the dawn of the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century, knowledge is power.  And that's true for any situation. And so in regard to the AT&T-Time Warner deal, before offering a judgement, I'd like to have more knowledge.  For instance, I'd like to know more about this October 25 story in The Daily Beast, ""AT&T Is Spying on Americans for Profit, New Documents Reveal.""  I don't wish to prejudge the truth, and I learned a long time ago not to trust everything I read in the newspaper, er, news media.  In addition, I'm no foe of internal security, so if I were still a policymaker, I would seek out all the relevant and appropriate facts. V: And so after you gather the data . . . TR: Then we need a good plan.  Sometimes, of course, doing nothing is a good plan.  But most of the time, a good plan is an active plan.  A strenuous plan, some might say.  And as to plans and new things, back in '01, I called for the creation of a department of commerce for my cabinet.  And in '03, I was pleased to sign legislation creating the Department of Commerce and Labor.V: A Department of Commerce and Labor?TR: Yes, after my idea went into the Congressional sausage factory, it ended up becoming the Department of Commerce and Labor, which I thought was well and good.  That double-arrangement lasted until 1913, when ""labor"" was carved out and a separate Department of Labor was established.   I'll admit, back then, in my retirement, I wasn't entirely happy about that splitting off, because I have always believed, per Henry Carey, that business and labor should work together; I regret that business and labor are often put into separate, and antagonistic, silos. V: Forgive me, sir, but creating a cabinet department called ""Commerce"" doesn't quite seem to be an answer to the challenge posed by populism.  The US still has that Department of Commerce, and it doesn't seem to do very much. TR: Quite true.  But my idea was different: I wanted my Department of Commerce to have genuine regulatory teeth.  V: Interesting . . .  TR: You see, business regulation can come in two main forms.  We might think of it as the distinction between quantity and quality.As to quantity, which is to say, size, the government can choose to focus on the largeness of a business--that's what antitrust is all about.  I should add that, to my mind, all talk of ""competition"" in antitrust enforcement is mostly just a cover for a more elemental instinct that people often have--namely, that a given business is just too darn big.  And if people think a business is too big, they can always conjure up a highfalutin rationale for cutting it down to size.  I can understand that anti-big sentiment, but I don't often agree with it. V: Okay, that's one kind of regulation, quantity.  What's the other kind of regulation?TR: The second kind of regulation is about quality--the actual nature of the thing itself.  How does it behave?  How does it treat its workers?  How does it treat its customers?   Does it operate in the public interest?  If you think about it, those sorts of qualitative questions exist independently from the question of size, or quantity.  V: You mean, a big company can be good, and a small company can be bad. TR: Exactly.  We want all companies to be good, and if they are good, there should be no objection to seeing them grow.  It's perfectly right and proper to reward corporate virtue with growth and profitability.  I might add that this second kind of regulation, about quality, is more often called supervisorial.  In that same 1901 speech, I used the word ""supervision,"" or a variation of it, a total of seven times.  That is, the government, preferably the federal government, must lay out the rules of the road; it must supervise. V: Why the federal government, as opposed to local and state government?   TR: Look, I'm no detractor of local and state government.  I was proud to serve as police commissioner of New York City, and then I was proud to serve as governor of New York State. And yet as corporations grew, just in my lifetime, to almost unimaginable size, it became obvious that big firms, operating in all the 45 states--oops, I mean 50, we were at 45 when I came into office, and in my time, we added Oklahoma, with, of course, four more states coming later--could make a mockery of state-by-state regulation.  So again, we need a national government, a government that exerts national leadership, including in the regulatory realm.  V: So ""supervision"" is really national supervision?  TR:  Yes.  A key part of the social contract is that everyone does his or her part.  That's good citizenship, especially if it's a corporate citizen, enjoying the considerable legal benefits of incorporation.  As I said in 1901: Great corporations exist only because they are created and safeguarded by our institutions; and it is therefore our right and our duty to see that they work in harmony with these institutions.V: There's that word again, harmony. TR: Yes, and obviously, as part of the promotion of harmony, the privileged and powerful have an extra burden--to lead by setting a good example.  Which seems only fair.  Yet regardless of size or standing, rules are rules, and everyone should abide by them.  V: Wherever their social station.  TR: Yes, indeed.  But again, those at the top have extra responsibility.  To begin with, profitable businesses should pay their fair share of taxes.  In addition, they must follow the rules of fair play and the rules about conservation and pollution.  And of course, these days they must also obey a thousand other laws and regulations, concerning occupational safety, discrimination, sexual harassment, and on and on.  V: Red tape.TR: Yes. It can be a curse.  In fact, I think we have too much red tape for business--and especially too much of what's now called ""political correctness,"" mandated by the bureaucrats and the courts.And yet here's something that's strange to me, Square Dealer that I am.  We regulate word-choices in the workplace to the most elaborate degree, and yet we don't pay much attention to the basics of industrial justice--that is, how much workers get paid, how to protect them from unfair competition by illegal aliens, and how to thwart layoffs, offshoring, and other forms of unfair profiteering.  To put the matter in the bluntest terms, we regulate the little stuff that doesn't much matter, but we ignore the big stuff that really does matter. V: Of course, I realize that to a trial lawyer, or to a judge, or to a bureaucrat, the little stuff can make for a lucrative career.TR: Yes, I'm afraid you're right.  And in such a costly environment, capital often finds it easier to do its building and hiring overseas.  Instead, we want America to be the hub of hiring and building. V:  That's a very Republican-sounding sentiment.  TR: Yes, by God, I am a Republican!  I believe in free enterprise, private property, and freedom in general!  I know that many of my enemies have regarded me as some sort of leftist, but I've always embraced the same consistent conservative wisdom about liberty and property.  And yet, per Burke, Disraeli, and other rightist sages, I've also always believed that the wise leader must see when it's necessary to change, and then be willing to make that needed change.  Otherwise, we risk rack, revolution, and ruin. V: So let's step back--back to regulation.  You're saying that the size, or quantity, of a company matters less than the nature, or quality, of that company.  The quality that is, of its willingness, and ability, to comply with the rules.TR: Yes. In the modern age, we must accept that companies will grow big, and yet we always want them to behave themselves.   Indeed, it's entirely appropriate for companies to grow large, because this is a large country.  Moreover, we are competing against other big countries with their own big companies.  The common phrase these days, used around the world although not so much here, is ""national champions."" I like that concept.  I think we need more national champions, companies that can go toe-to-toe with other nations' champions in the international economic arena.You see, this is a world that is increasingly guided by Asian ideas of corporate consolidation and dominance--that is, the guiding vision of Japanese zaibatsu and Korean chaebol, two important words for industrial hyper-powers.  I think we, too, need some of those ""incredible hulks"" on our side.  Just as you fight fire with fire, so, too, you fight size with size.  Yet at the same time, of course, our national champions have to play by the rules. V: That's a lot of concentration.  And a lot of bigness. TR: Now, Virgil, I know that you wrote the Eclogues, as a tribute to the simplicity of rural life--V: Hey now . . . TR: --but the fact remains that only bigness guarantees survival.  That is, one must be large enough to fight for oneself.  For instance, you Romans were never going to beat the Parthians, or the Teutons, with bucolic decentralization.  Instead, you needed the mighty military that only centralization could guarantee. Virgil: Ah, and yet there's much to be said for the simple life.  As I wrote:The trees are cloth'd with leaves, the fields with grass;The blossoms blow; the birds on bushes sing;And Nature has accomplish'd all the spring.TR: That's really very nice, and nobody enjoys the great outdoors more than I.  And yet the tournament of nations is won by strong militaries backed up by strong economies with strong industries. When I sent the Great White Fleet around the world in 1907, that was possible only because we had the muscle and might of America--including corporate America--in our corner.  So, in other words, you can't turn back the clock.  There can be no return to some idealized edenic world. We must recognize that times change, and we must accept the vigorous challenge of living in the present day, amidst all its dangers.  V: Your words are painful to my poetic soul . . .TR: Remember, Virgil, after you wrote the Eclogues, you then wrote the Aeneid, which is, of course, one very long ode to imperial power.V: True.TR:  So we agree: When times change, needs change.  As I said in that same 1901 speech:When the Constitution was adopted, at the end of the eighteenth century, no human wisdom could foretell the sweeping changes, alike in industrial and political conditions, which were to take place by the beginning of the twentieth century.V: But what about freedom and liberty?  TR: My dear boy, I am describing how you preserve freedom and liberty!  The Bolshevik Revolution in Russia came after my time in the White House, but even at the turn of the century, revolution was in the air; as I've noted, it was radicalism that killed poor President McKinley.  So yes, we must always be willing and able to suppress violence, but we must also be willing and able to address the injustices that provoke ill-will and violence. Thus as paradoxical as it may seem, sometimes one needs regulation in order to enjoy freedom.  After all, it's only when everyone plays by rules that are fair-and-square that the individual can enjoy life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  As my friend Herbert Croly explained, if we wish to achieve Jeffersonian goals, then we must apply Hamiltonian mechanisms. I might add, too, that it's simply not sufficient to leave these matters to the ""invisible hand,"" hoping that things will just work out.  As I saw in my time, and as Americans have been reminded in recent years, the invisible hand often turns out to be nothing more than ""the thudding fist of the powerful.""  Yet let me emphasize: That's not an argument for socialism; it's an argument for enlightened capitalism. V: In other words, within an ordered structure, one finds freedom and autonomy.  Indeed, that's what we Romans thought. TR: Yes.  The Roman emperors, including your man, Augustus Caesar, weren't quite my cup of tea, but the earlier Roman Republic--now that was a great institution!--was a model, of course, for our own American Constitution. And if we're on the subject of order and structure, as I've said, I'm always more interested in the quality of a structure, as opposed to its quantitative size.  A bad actor can be small, or he can be big--it's not the size that matters, it's the character. So that's why I thought we needed national regulation to deal with national problems--so that all companies, small as well as big, would have to adhere to a certain set of standards.  In particular, my idea, back then, was to build upon the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, which had begun--but only barely begun--the necessary process of regulating the railroads.  Yet early on in my presidency, I found that I didn't have much in the way of legal tools.  And so I had to rely on my own personality, plus, of course, the presidential ""bully pulpit.""For example, in 1902, I confronted a coal strike that threatened the entire national economy.  The miners, of course, wanted a big raise, while the mine operators, of course, were offering no raise at all.  My solution was a compromise: a modest-sized raise, and an end to the strike.  Nobody was completely happy, but the economy was nevertheless protected. Once again, it's all about the harmony of interests.  In the end, miners want to work, and mine operators want their profits.  So if the two sides can be made to see past their angry passions and recognize their own true self-interest, a bargain can be struck, and harmony can be restored. Indeed, in my time as president, I even applied that conservative principle of stewardship to college football.  In those days, when there were no helmets, hundreds of young athletes were being killed or crippled on the gridiron every year.  Look, I adore sports, including football; I would've loved to have played at Harvard, were it not for my asthma.  Yet at the same time, I could see that if the carnage on the playing fields were to continue, there wouldn't be any college football.  So I called in the schools and the coaches and mediated a solution, including such ""reforms"" as the forward pass and the abolition of mass formations. Thus I saved the game as a collegiate sport.V: Speaking of harmonious mediation, you won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1906 for mediating an end to the Russo-Japanese War. TR: Yes, so much for another myth about me, that I was some kind of warmonger! Yet at the same time, mediation can only go so far--it's not always applicable.  That is, sometimes, a leader needs that iron fist inside the velvet glove.  And thus we come back to regulation.  As I've said, I don't really care about the size of a man, or the size of company, so long as he, or it, plays by the rules.  And it always helps when those rules are clear, enforceable--and enforced. In the White House, I came to realize that the selling of dishonest and adulterated products was not only a scandal, but also a dire threat to public health.  So in 1906 we passed the Food and Drug Act.  In that instance, I wasn't interested in mediating anything, because when the public is at risk, there aren't two sides to the story; there's only one side--the right side. V: So there's a time for mediation, and there's a time for protection.TR: Yes!  Also in '06, I could observe that even after the creation of the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1887, the railroads were still in gross violation of their public trust.  Once again, mediation, by itself, was hopeless, because the railroads weren't interested.  Again, the only answer was regulation. Yet many of my fellow Republicans, led by the execrable Sen. Aldrich, were not interested in doing anything about the railroads.  Yes, the reactionaries of that era thought it was okay for a railroad to be built and maintained at public sufferance--and yet they also insisted that all the rights belonged to the railroads, and that the public had no meaningful rights.V: What do you mean? TR: Look, all those railroads were built only because of legal and political clearance.  That is, rights-of-way had to be gained, often by eminent domain.  In addition, many of the railroad lines were built with bonds either issued, or guaranteed, by the public.  And then, of course, all that private property that was accumulated had to be protected by public authorities.  So surely, after all that public subsidy and effort, the public interest, too, deserved consideration.  And plenty of Republicans--out of the Lincoln-McKinley tradition--agreed with me.  But as I said, plenty of other Republicans, the servants of capital, did not agree.  Hence the political tussle. Indeed, because so many of my fellow Republicans were stubborn about reform, I had to work with Democrats.  In 1906, I ended up working with both parties in Congress to pass the Hepburn Act, which for the first time gave real muscle to the Interstate Commerce Commission.  Congressman William Peters Hepburn of Iowa was a Republican, but my principal ally in the Senate, behind the scenes, was Sen. Benjamin Ryan Tillman, Democrat of South Carolina, known as ""Pitchfork Ben.""V: He sounds like a scary fellow. TR: Tillman was very much an angry populist.  Yet at the same time, he was a shrewd operator, who understood that his region, the South, was losing in the power struggle with the great railroads.  And so we worked together, albeit indirectly.  In fact, we ended up at odds in the final passage of that bill.  And yet despite all the acrimony, there was never a moment when Tillman and I didn't share the same ultimate belief--that is, in the need to regulate the railroads. V: How Machiavellian of you!TR: Yes, I suppose it was.  You know, Machiavelli is misunderstood.  He is regarded as some sort of conniver, when, in fact, he was an Italian patriot, centuries before Garibaldi and Italian nationalism.  Machiavelli wanted to use his political skills to build a united Italy that couldn't be conquered by enemies; yet today, he is remembered as just a clever sneak.  Sad!   As for me, I believe that politics should always be about the commonweal, and yet at the same time, as Machiavelli certainly also understood, one can't take the politics out of politics. In fact, Tillman and I, different as we were, found common ground on another important issue, too.  In the following year, 1907, I was pleased to sign the Tillman Act, which banned corporate contributions to politics.  That law was in place, I might note, for more than a century, until it was overturned in 2010 by the Supreme Court in the Citizens United case.  And now, in 2016, as Hillary Clinton and her donors are trying to buy this election, I might ask my fellow Republicans: Do you really think that the GOP is better off with unlimited donations?  Are Republicans better off if Democrat George Soros, with his unlimited resources, can give unlimitedly to Democrats?    V: It looks to me as though many Republicans would rather have the continuation of big donations that go them, even if, in fact, the Democrats get more.TR: Yes, I'm afraid that too many Republicans have gone over to the side of Aldrich--that is, making a kneejerk defense of concentrated corporate power, even if, politically speaking, that has proven to be a losing proposition.  Indeed, it seems sometimes that it's hard to identify that Lincolnian strand--the idea that labor is prior to capital--in today's GOP.  V: All right, speaking of ""concentrated corporate power,"" let's talk now about the AT&T-Time Warner case. TR: As I've said, I'm not hostile to ""big,"" in and of itself.V: Yet I've learned that under your administration, the federal government filed a big antitrust case against the American Tobacco Company, as well as laying the groundwork for an even bigger antitrust case against Standard Oil.  You are, after all, known as the Great Trust-buster. TR: Yes, well.  Those two cases you cite were egregious; Standard Oil was especially egregious: It had a 90 percent market share, and was no kind of good corporate citizen.  So something had to be done, and I'm glad Will Taft did it.V: Even though you had your differences with him.TR: Yes, we met angrily on the political battlefield in 1912, although ultimately, we managed to put all that behind us.  And yet if we can return to antitrust and regulation: As I have said, I never felt, as president, that I had all the right regulatory tools needed to achieve industrial justice.  If only the Department of Commerce had been enacted the way I originally intended, then that's how I would have preferred to handle the question of corporate consolidations. V: Yet at the same time, always, these entities, big or small, must be regulated.TR: Yes.  And now, as for AT&T and Time Warner, I am much more interested in understanding how the deal would serve the interests of the nation, rather than seeing how well these companies, or any company, will fit on some arbitrary Procrustean Bed, measuring only size, or quantity, and not quality.  After all, corporations must serve the nation that spawned them. That is, indeed, the Roman ideal.  V: Yes. The cursus honorum, as we called it back in the day. TR: Right! The idea that serving the nation is a sacred calling--that's an idea that seems, unfortunately, to have been lost in recent decades.  And also lost, I might add, is the sturdy idea that conscious statecraft is needed to take care of our own and to advance the national interest.  It seems that the avant-garde right, as well as the left, has gone in for a different idea--that we must be subservient to the world, and all its migrant peoples, and subservient also to the global market.  I totally disagree.Instead, the old-fashioned conservative in me recognizes that some things, such as national well-being and national honor, must always be conserved.  And yet at the same time, the progressive in me recognizes that treasured verities must be actively conserved.  If they are left on their own, unsheltered, they are too easily eroded, or even destroyed.  Hence the Square Deal: Bringing the benefits of the American Dream to all requires a lot more than antitrust, because ill-fortune, and injustice, can come in all sizes.  V: Theodore, you've clarified a lot.  Thank you very much for your time.TR: You're welcome.  As you can see, I have plenty of time.  Indeed, in my infinite free time, I have ample occasion to worry about the future of my country. V:  So you're always on watch, even from these nether ramparts.TR: Yes.  I've been dead for 97 years, but I'm still around, still a presence in American life.V: As you should be.  TR: You're a good man, Virgil!  So in closing, please let me read what I said in a speech to the Union League Club of Philadelphia in 1905.  I think it lays out nicely my hopes for the country and its future: We do not intend that this Republic shall ever fail as those republics of olden times failed, in which there finally came to be a government by classes, which resulted either in the poor plundering the rich or in the rich exploiting and in one form or another enslaving the poor; for either event means the destruction of free institutions and of individual liberty.V: Well said, sir!  Oh, and one last thing, Theodore, before you go: As was noted at the beginning, what can be done about CNN's political bias?  Do you think there's anything that can address that? TR: Ha!  I've always seen myself as a problem-solver.  But I think that particular problem is hopeless.  No matter who, or what, owns it, CNN will aways be . . . CNN. V: Thank you, Mr. President.  
Great corporations exist only because they are created and safeguarded by our institutions; and it is therefore our right and our duty to see that they work in harmony with these institutions.

The trees are cloth'd with leaves, the fields with grass;
The blossoms blow; the birds on bushes sing;
And Nature has accomplish'd all the spring.

When the Constitution was adopted, at the end of the eighteenth century, no human wisdom could foretell the sweeping changes, alike in industrial and political conditions, which were to take place by the beginning of the twentieth century.

We do not intend that this Republic shall ever fail as those republics of olden times failed, in which there finally came to be a government by classes, which resulted either in the poor plundering the rich or in the rich exploiting and in one form or another enslaving the poor; for either event means the destruction of free institutions and of individual liberty.
SIGN UPIn Part One, we considered the curious partisan political inversion around the proposed AT&T-Time Warner deal, as Donald Trump has come out noisily in opposition, while Hillary Clinton seems quietly supportive. Part OneIn Part Two, we introduced our guest-expert, the Great Trustbuster himself, Theodore Roosevelt, who explained that the history of the Republican Party's antitrust policy is more complex than most people realize. Now, in Part Three, we will press Roosevelt for a specific opinion on the AT&T-Time Warner deal, and he will expand on his quantity-vs.-quality theory of regulation.  Virgil: Theodore, you have the floor.Theodore Roosevelt: Because everyone's busy, I will summarize the arguments I made about antitrust in my 1901 speech.  I said that rather than go off half-cocked, we should study the situation, gain a maximum understanding of business dealings, and then and only then formulate a plan. To use a nautical analogy, the wise ship-captain must have good charts before he lifts anchor. the arguments I made about antitrust in my 1901 speechV: Indeed, you published a book of sea-going military history, The Naval War of 1812, when you were 23 years old--and it's still in print today.  Impressive! still in print todayTR: Thank you.  My understanding of naval history helped me a lot when I was Assistant Secretary of the Navy--V: --back when there was a grand total of one Assistant Secretary of the Navy. TR: Right.  As Sir Francis Bacon said at the dawn of the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century, knowledge is power.  And that's true for any situation. And so in regard to the AT&T-Time Warner deal, before offering a judgement, I'd like to have more knowledge.  For instance, I'd like to know more about this October 25 story in The Daily Beast, ""AT&T Is Spying on Americans for Profit, New Documents Reveal.""  I don't wish to prejudge the truth, and I learned a long time ago not to trust everything I read in the newspaper, er, news media.  In addition, I'm no foe of internal security, so if I were still a policymaker, I would seek out all the relevant and appropriate facts. AT&T Is Spying on Americans for Profit, New Documents RevealV: And so after you gather the data . . . TR: Then we need a good plan.  Sometimes, of course, doing nothing is a good plan.  But most of the time, a good plan is an active plan.  A strenuous plan, some might say.  strenuous planAnd as to plans and new things, back in '01, I called for the creation of a department of commerce for my cabinet.  And in '03, I was pleased to sign legislation creating the Department of Commerce and Labor.V: A Department of Commerce and Labor?TR: Yes, after my idea went into the Congressional sausage factory, it ended up becoming the Department of Commerce and Labor, which I thought was well and good.  That double-arrangement lasted until 1913, when ""labor"" was carved out and a separate Department of Labor was established.   I'll admit, back then, in my retirement, I wasn't entirely happy about that splitting off, because I have always believed, per Henry Carey, that business and labor should work together; I regret that business and labor are often put into separate, and antagonistic, silos. V: Forgive me, sir, but creating a cabinet department called ""Commerce"" doesn't quite seem to be an answer to the challenge posed by populism.  The US still has that Department of Commerce, and it doesn't seem to do very much. TR: Quite true.  But my idea was different: I wanted my Department of Commerce to have genuine regulatory teeth.  V: Interesting . . .  TR: You see, business regulation can come in two main forms.  We might think of it as the distinction between quantity and quality.As to quantity, which is to say, size, the government can choose to focus on the largeness of a business--that's what antitrust is all about.  I should add that, to my mind, all talk of ""competition"" in antitrust enforcement is mostly just a cover for a more elemental instinct that people often have--namely, that a given business is just too darn big.  And if people think a business is too big, they can always conjure up a highfalutin rationale for cutting it down to size.  I can understand that anti-big sentiment, but I don't often agree with it. V: Okay, that's one kind of regulation, quantity.  What's the other kind of regulation?TR: The second kind of regulation is about quality--the actual nature of the thing itself.  How does it behave?  How does it treat its workers?  How does it treat its customers?   Does it operate in the public interest?  If you think about it, those sorts of qualitative questions exist independently from the question of size, or quantity.  V: You mean, a big company can be good, and a small company can be bad. TR: Exactly.  We want all companies to be good, and if they are good, there should be no objection to seeing them grow.  It's perfectly right and proper to reward corporate virtue with growth and profitability.  I might add that this second kind of regulation, about quality, is more often called supervisorial.  In that same 1901 speech, I used the word ""supervision,"" or a variation of it, a total of seven times.  That is, the government, preferably the federal government, must lay out the rules of the road; it must supervise. V: Why the federal government, as opposed to local and state government?   TR: Look, I'm no detractor of local and state government.  I was proud to serve as police commissioner of New York City, and then I was proud to serve as governor of New York State. And yet as corporations grew, just in my lifetime, to almost unimaginable size, it became obvious that big firms, operating in all the 45 states--oops, I mean 50, we were at 45 when I came into office, and in my time, we added Oklahoma, with, of course, four more states coming later--could make a mockery of state-by-state regulation.  So again, we need a national government, a government that exerts national leadership, including in the regulatory realm.  V: So ""supervision"" is really national supervision?  TR:  Yes.  A key part of the social contract is that everyone does his or her part.  That's good citizenship, especially if it's a corporate citizen, enjoying the considerable legal benefits of incorporation.  As I said in 1901: Great corporations exist only because they are created and safeguarded by our institutions; and it is therefore our right and our duty to see that they work in harmony with these institutions.V: There's that word again, harmony. TR: Yes, and obviously, as part of the promotion of harmony, the privileged and powerful have an extra burden--to lead by setting a good example.  Which seems only fair.  Yet regardless of size or standing, rules are rules, and everyone should abide by them.  V: Wherever their social station.  TR: Yes, indeed.  But again, those at the top have extra responsibility.  To begin with, profitable businesses should pay their fair share of taxes.  In addition, they must follow the rules of fair play and the rules about conservation and pollution.  And of course, these days they must also obey a thousand other laws and regulations, concerning occupational safety, discrimination, sexual harassment, and on and on.  V: Red tape.TR: Yes. It can be a curse.  In fact, I think we have too much red tape for business--and especially too much of what's now called ""political correctness,"" mandated by the bureaucrats and the courts.And yet here's something that's strange to me, Square Dealer that I am.  We regulate word-choices in the workplace to the most elaborate degree, and yet we don't pay much attention to the basics of industrial justice--that is, how much workers get paid, how to protect them from unfair competition by illegal aliens, and how to thwart layoffs, offshoring, and other forms of unfair profiteering.  To put the matter in the bluntest terms, we regulate the little stuff that doesn't much matter, but we ignore the big stuff that really does matter. V: Of course, I realize that to a trial lawyer, or to a judge, or to a bureaucrat, the little stuff can make for a lucrative career.TR: Yes, I'm afraid you're right.  And in such a costly environment, capital often finds it easier to do its building and hiring overseas.  Instead, we want America to be the hub of hiring and building. V:  That's a very Republican-sounding sentiment.  TR: Yes, by God, I am a Republican!  I believe in free enterprise, private property, and freedom in general!  I know that many of my enemies have regarded me as some sort of leftist, but I've always embraced the same consistent conservative wisdom about liberty and property.  And yet, per Burke, Disraeli, and other rightist sages, I've also always believed that the wise leader must see when it's necessary to change, and then be willing to make that needed change.  Otherwise, we risk rack, revolution, and ruin. V: So let's step back--back to regulation.  You're saying that the size, or quantity, of a company matters less than the nature, or quality, of that company.  The quality that is, of its willingness, and ability, to comply with the rules.TR: Yes. In the modern age, we must accept that companies will grow big, and yet we always want them to behave themselves.   Indeed, it's entirely appropriate for companies to grow large, because this is a large country.  Moreover, we are competing against other big countries with their own big companies.  The common phrase these days, used around the world although not so much here, is ""national champions."" I like that concept.  I think we need more national champions, companies that can go toe-to-toe with other nations' champions in the international economic arena.You see, this is a world that is increasingly guided by Asian ideas of corporate consolidation and dominance--that is, the guiding vision of Japanese zaibatsu and Korean chaebol, two important words for industrial hyper-powers.  I think we, too, need some of those ""incredible hulks"" on our side.  Just as you fight fire with fire, so, too, you fight size with size.  Yet at the same time, of course, our national champions have to play by the rules. zaibatsuchaebolV: That's a lot of concentration.  And a lot of bigness. TR: Now, Virgil, I know that you wrote the Eclogues, as a tribute to the simplicity of rural life--EcloguesV: Hey now . . . TR: --but the fact remains that only bigness guarantees survival.  That is, one must be large enough to fight for oneself.  For instance, you Romans were never going to beat the Parthians, or the Teutons, with bucolic decentralization.

Thus as paradoxical as it may seem, sometimes one needs regulation in order to enjoy freedom.  After all, it's only when everyone plays by rules that are fair-and-square that the individual can enjoy life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  As my friend Herbert Croly explained, if we wish to achieve Jeffersonian goals, then we must apply Hamiltonian mechanisms.

TR: Look, all those railroads were built only because of legal and political clearance.  That is, rights-of-way had to be gained, often by eminent domain.  In addition, many of the railroad lines were built with bonds either issued, or guaranteed, by the public.  And then, of course, all that private property that was accumulated had to be protected by public authorities.  So surely, after all that public subsidy and effort, the public interest, too, deserved consideration.  And plenty of Republicans--out of the Lincoln-McKinley tradition--agreed with me.  But as I said, plenty of other Republicans, the servants of capital, did not agree.  Hence the political tussle. Indeed, because so many of my fellow Republicans were stubborn about reform, I had to work with Democrats.  In 1906, I ended up working with both parties in Congress to pass the Hepburn Act, which for the first time gave real muscle to the Interstate Commerce Commission.  Congressman William Peters Hepburn of Iowa was a Republican, but my principal ally in the Senate, behind the scenes, was Sen. Benjamin Ryan Tillman, Democrat of South Carolina, known as ""Pitchfork Ben.""Hepburn ActV: He sounds like a scary fellow. TR: Tillman was very much an angry populist.  Yet at the same time, he was a shrewd operator, who understood that his region, the South, was losing in the power struggle with the great railroads.  And so we worked together, albeit indirectly.  In fact, we ended up at odds in the final passage of that bill.  And yet despite all the acrimony, there was never a moment when Tillman and I didn't share the same ultimate belief--that is, in the need to regulate the railroads. V: How Machiavellian of you!TR: Yes, I suppose it was.  You know, Machiavelli is misunderstood.  He is regarded as some sort of conniver, when, in fact, he was an Italian patriot, centuries before Garibaldi and Italian nationalism.  Machiavelli wanted to use his political skills to build a united Italy that couldn't be conquered by enemies; yet today, he is remembered as just a clever sneak.  Sad!    Garibaldi and Italian nationalismAs for me, I believe that politics should always be about the commonweal, and yet at the same time, as Machiavelli certainly also understood, one can't take the politics out of politics. In fact, Tillman and I, different as we were, found common ground on another important issue, too.  In the following year, 1907, I was pleased to sign the Tillman Act, which banned corporate contributions to politics.  That law was in place, I might note, for more than a century, until it was overturned in 2010 by the Supreme Court in the Citizens United case.  And now, in 2016, as Hillary Clinton and her donors are trying to buy this election, I might ask my fellow Republicans: Do you really think that the GOP is better off with unlimited donations?  Are Republicans better off if Democrat George Soros, with his unlimited resources, can give unlimitedly to Democrats?    Tillman ActV: It looks to me as though many Republicans would rather have the continuation of big donations that go them, even if, in fact, the Democrats get more.TR: Yes, I'm afraid that too many Republicans have gone over to the side of Aldrich--that is, making a kneejerk defense of concentrated corporate power, even if, politically speaking, that has proven to be a losing proposition.  Indeed, it seems sometimes that it's hard to identify that Lincolnian strand--the idea that labor is prior to capital--in today's GOP.  V: All right, speaking of ""concentrated corporate power,"" let's talk now about the AT&T-Time Warner case. TR: As I've said, I'm not hostile to ""big,"" in and of itself.V: Yet I've learned that under your administration, the federal government filed a big antitrust case against the American Tobacco Company, as well as laying the groundwork for an even bigger antitrust case against Standard Oil.  You are, after all, known as the Great Trust-buster. antitrust case against the American Tobacco Companyeven bigger antitrust case against Standard OilTR: Yes, well.  Those two cases you cite were egregious; Standard Oil was especially egregious: It had a 90 percent market share, and was no kind of good corporate citizen.  So something had to be done, and I'm glad Will Taft did it.Will TaftV: Even though you had your differences with him.you had your differences with himTR: Yes, we met angrily on the political battlefield in 1912, although ultimately, we managed to put all that behind us.  And yet if we can return to antitrust and regulation: As I have said, I never felt, as president, that I had all the right regulatory tools needed to achieve industrial justice.  If only the Department of Commerce had been enacted the way I originally intended, then that's how I would have preferred to handle the question of corporate consolidations. V: Yet at the same time, always, these entities, big or small, must be regulated.TR: Yes.  And now, as for AT&T and Time Warner, I am much more interested in understanding how the deal would serve the interests of the nation, rather than seeing how well these companies, or any company, will fit on some arbitrary Procrustean Bed, measuring only size, or quantity, and not quality.  After all, corporations must serve the nation that spawned them. That is, indeed, the Roman ideal.  Procrustean BedV: Yes. The cursus honorum, as we called it back in the day. cursus honorumTR: Right! The idea that serving the nation is a sacred calling--that's an idea that seems, unfortunately, to have been lost in recent decades.  And also lost, I might add, is the sturdy idea that conscious statecraft is needed to take care of our own and to advance the national interest.  It seems that the avant-garde right, as well as the left, has gone in for a different idea--that we must be subservient to the world, and all its migrant peoples, and subservient also to the global market.  I totally disagree.Instead, the old-fashioned conservative in me recognizes that some things, such as national well-being and national honor, must always be conserved.  And yet at the same time, the progressive in me recognizes that treasured verities must be actively conserved.  If they are left on their own, unsheltered, they are too easily eroded, or even destroyed.  Hence the Square Deal: Bringing the benefits of the American Dream to all requires a lot more than antitrust, because ill-fortune, and injustice, can come in all sizes.  V: Theodore, you've clarified a lot.  Thank you very much for your time.TR: You're welcome.  As you can see, I have plenty of time.  Indeed, in my infinite free time, I have ample occasion to worry about the future of my country. V:  So you're always on watch, even from these nether ramparts.TR: Yes.  I've been dead for 97 years, but I'm still around, still a presence in American life.V: As you should be.  TR: You're a good man, Virgil!  So in closing, please let me read what I said in a speech to the Union League Club of Philadelphia in 1905.  I think it lays out nicely my hopes for the country and its future: Union League ClubWe do not intend that this Republic shall ever fail as those republics of olden times failed, in which there finally came to be a government by classes, which resulted either in the poor plundering the rich or in the rich exploiting and in one form or another enslaving the poor; for either event means the destruction of free institutions and of individual liberty.V: Well said, sir!  Oh, and one last thing, Theodore, before you go: As was noted at the beginning, what can be done about CNN's political bias?  Do you think there's anything that can address that? TR: Ha!  I've always seen myself as a problem-solver.  But I think that particular problem is hopeless.  No matter who, or what, owns it, CNN will aways be . . . CNN. V: Thank you, Mr. President.

On November 8, San Franciscans will get to choose whether or not their sanctuary city that protects illegal aliens, including repeat criminals such as Kate Steinle's alleged killer, from deportation, will also allow non-citizens to vote in school board elections.Similar measures failed in 2004 and 2010, but San Francisco Assemblyman David Chiu, whose parents were Taiwanese immigrants, is confident it stands a good chance of passing this year because there is no organized opposition. ""I think that's because of the ugly, anti-immigrant statements expressed by Donald Trump and his supporters,"" he told Bloomberg News.The article slams Donald Trump's warnings about voter fraud by non-citizens, saying ""there's no evidence to support the Republican nominee's claims of election fraud, "" even as it describes the Democrats' effort in cities to give ballots to illegals.An energetic debate on whether or not to allow non-citizens to vote in American elections has taken place for most of the country's history.As Bloomberg notes, as many as 40 states used to allow non-citizens to vote before this country covered the span of a continent and immigration came from Europe. When high levels of European immigration spurred the Coolidge administration to shut down the unpopular inflow of mass migration, reducing the annual inflow from one million to around 150,000, states also moved to end non-citizen voting. Arkansas finally closing the door on non-citizen voting in 1926.The Bloomberg article largely ignores the practical impact on Americans of voting by large blocs of illegals in favor of focus on the interests of illegals. For example, many African-American communities -- already overwhelmed by a flood of cheap, imported labor -- would likely lose percentage points in local disputes, where even small numbers can swing elections.Currently, it's illegal for non-citizens to vote in federal elections, but that has not stopped President Barack Obama's deputies from making it difficult to remove them from the voter rolls.As election-law expert Hans A. von Spakovsky has exhaustively documented, granting non-citizens privileges normally reserved for citizens willy-nilly results in fraud. But ""there has been virtually no discussion of how to ensure that they (and millions of legal aliens) do not register and vote in elections,"" he wrote in a analysis published by the Heritage Foundation.There is no systematic review of voter registration rolls by states to find non-citizens, and the relevant federal agencies-in direct violation of federal law-refuse to cooperate with state election officials seeking to verify the citizenship status of registered voters...The refusal of federal agencies to obey the law compels local election officials to rely almost entirely on the 'honor system' to keep non-citizens from the polls.Discoveries of non-citizens on voter rolls is ""accidental,"" he adds: Though the Department of Justice has no procedures in place for a systematic investigation of these types of criminal violations, in just a three-year period, it prosecuted and convicted more than a dozen non-citizens who registered and voted in federal elections in Alaska, Florida, the District of Columbia, and Colorado. Among them was an alien in southern Florida, Rafael Velasquez, who not only voted, but even ran for the state legislature. Eight of the 19 September 11 hijackers were registered to vote in either Virginia or Florida-registrations that were probably obtained when they applied for driver's licenses.There is no systematic review of voter registration rolls by states to find non-citizens, and the relevant federal agencies-in direct violation of federal law-refuse to cooperate with state election officials seeking to verify the citizenship status of registered voters...The refusal of federal agencies to obey the law compels local election officials to rely almost entirely on the 'honor system' to keep non-citizens from the polls.

Trump and his Democratic opponent Hillary Rodham Clinton are tied in the battleground state of Nevada, the latest Breitbart News Network/Gravis Marketing survey shows.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBoth Trump and Clinton are at 46 percent each, while Libertarian Gary Johnson is at three percent and the Green Party's Dr. Jill Stein is at one percent. Five percent remain undecided. Technically, Stein is not on the ballot in Nevada.NEVADA (October 27, 2016) by Breitbart News on ScribdNevada's six electoral votes-which will go to the winner of the state, Trump or Clinton-are crucial to either's path to 270 electoral votes, the threshold necessary to win the presidency, on election day.The new survey, which polled 875 registered voters in Nevada with a margin of error of 3.3 percent, was conducted on Oct. 25. That means the survey was done before the FBI reopened its criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton's illicit home brew email server, which the FBI announced Friday afternoon.On the Hillary Clinton email question, when asked in the poll whether the FBI made the right decision or wrong decision to not indict Clinton, a majority--50 percent--of Nevadans surveyed said the FBI made the wrong decision. Only 45 percent said the FBI made the right decision and 5 percent were unsure.A majority in the poll do not think that America is on the right track and also want to change directions from the path that President Barack Obama--an ally of Hillary Clinton--has the country on. Fifty-two percent think America is on the wrong track, compared to 42 percent who think the country is moving in the right direction and 6 percent don't know. Also, 54 percent want the country to change direction from the path Obama has put America on, while just 42 percent want to continue on Obama's path and 4 percent don't know.Both Trump and Clinton have high unfavorability numbers. A majority, 54 percent, view Trump as either strongly or somewhat unfavorable, and 52 percent think so of Clinton.In Nevada's U.S. Senate race, the Republican candidate Rep. Joe Heck (R-NV) is not faring as well as Trump in the state. In fact, Democratic candidate Catherine Cortez Masto is beating Heck by 6 points--leading him 50 percent to 44 percent, with 6 percent unsure--well outside the survey's margin of error. Heck's failure to rise to the occasion in the poll against Masto in the race to replace outgoing Democratic Senate leader Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) comes after he's openly criticized Trump in the state.The Nevada poll numbers on other issues like trade, immigration, the media's handling of the election coverage, Obamacare and more all seem to match general national polling results.SIGN UP	['Reid', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

Such a tax becomes a de facto gun ban that raises the price of a $400 gun to $500, effectively pricing all types of guns out of reach for poorer families. Through this approach, Clinton is able to make gun ownership financially prohibitive without having to go on record as actually banning firearms.But Mark Kelly assured Costello's viewers that Clinton has no plan to go after guns.Costello said, ""There is still that sentiment out there, and it's very strong, that Hillary Clinton means to take away people's guns. You know, we hear that all the time. How does she convince people [otherwise] because she says that's not what it's about with her?""Kelly responded:I don't know.

But, I don't believe for one second that she has another agenda with regards to the Second Amendment.

What is the extent of any assurances provided that would prevent American victims of Iranian terrorism from seizing Iranian assets at these institutions?""They followed up by asking if any more payments to Iran would be authorized under the same statute, a possibility clearly implied by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, and pointedly observed the statute requires ""certification by the Attorney General"" that such payments are ""in the interest of the United States.""""Please explain how sending billions of dollars in cash to the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism is in our country's best interest,"" the Senator and Congressman asked AG Lynch.Lynch decided not to answer them at all.The response came through Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik, who wrote on October 24th that the Justice Department ""fully supported the Administration's resolution of several issues with Iran, including the settlement of the Hague Tribunal claim involving the Foreign Ministry sales fund, as well as the arrangements that led to the return of the U.S. citizens detained in Iran.""However, Kadzik said documents relevant to Rubio and Pompeo's questions ""contain sensitive information that is not appropriate for public release,"" and that ""disclosure of this information beyond members of the House and Senate and staff who are able to view them could adversely affect the diplomatic relations of the United States, as well as the State Department's ability to defend claims against the United States that are still being litigated at the Hague Tribunal.""On Friday, the Washington Free Beaconpublished Rubio and Pompeo's angry reaction.""It is frankly unacceptable that your department refuses to answer straightforward questions from the people's elected representatives in Congress about an important national security issue,"" they wrote to Lynch. ""Your staff failed to answer any of our questions, and instead provided a copy of public testimony and a lecture about the sensitivity of information associated with this issue.""""As the United States' chief law enforcement officer, it is outrageous that you would essentially plead the Fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries regarding your role in providing cash to the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism,"" Rubio and Pompeo wrote.They also reminded Lynch that the actions of her department ""come at a time when Iran continues to hold Americans hostage and unjustly sentence them to prison,"" most likely referring to the sentencing of Iranian-American father and son Baquer and Siamak Namazi.Rubio and Pompeo simply rejected Lynch's response, attaching a fresh copy of their 13 questions from October 4th and ""respectfully insisting"" she answer in an ""honest and thorough way.""""As elected representatives of the American people, we take our professional responsibilities seriously and hope you will do so as well,"" they concluded. ""You owe Congress and the American people answers to these questions. We look forward to receiving a serious response no later than November 4."""	['Hassan', 'Rubio', 'Lynch', 'Pompeo', 'Obama']	[]

We must not let her take her are criminal scheme into the Oval Office. I have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the department of justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made.Trump had announced that his focus for the day's events would be Obamacare -- as it has been for much of the week, with much of the country reeling from double- and triple-digit percentage increases in health care premiums.However, the FBI's decision has changed Trump's script -- and perhaps the course of the campaign.The crowd was loud, the mood feisty and festive throughout the event, even before Trump appeared on the stage. They cheered him as he walked through what remained of his stump speech, hitting his customary notes on trade, terrorism, the polls and the media.Catherine Robbins of nearby Dumbarton, sporting a pink devil's horn headband and a ""#BigLeague"" button on the back of her belt, told Breitbart News that she had wanted Trump to run as early as 2012. ""He gets things done. He's a businessman ... I look at it like this: America's a failing business. We need a real businessman to pull it together.""Asked why she thought Trump could win New Hampshire while previous Republican contenders had failed, she explained: ""He's liberty-minded, a free-thinker, not owned by the establishment.""I like him because he has the 'Live Free or Die' mentality,"" she added, quoting the state's motto.The Crane family drove three hours from Vermont to attend the rally -- with children Frankie, 11, and Montgomery, 14, missing school for the event. (Frankie, sporting an anti-Common Core T-shirt, did not seem to mind.)Crane family at Trump rally in NH (Joel Pollak / Breitbart News)Their father, Frank Crane, told Breitbart News: ""I want to get the kids involved. I want them to learn about politics for themselves -- not through the liberal media.""Wen, a real estate broker from Boston, also made the drive from out-of-state with her husband. Both are immigrants from China. She told Breitbart News that she supported Trump because of his policies, especially on terrorism, immigration, and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).Asked whether she objected to some of Trump's attacks on China, Wen told Breitbart News: ""I don't look at where I'm coming from. I look at what's good for America.""She added that she planned to return to the Granite State to knock on doors and turn out the vote.Former governor -- and Mitt Romney surrogate -- John Sununu worked the crowd up before Trump spoke, drawing loud cheers. He also stressed the need to retain Republican control of the Senate, and urged the crowd to support Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who faces a tough re-election fight and has refused to endorse Trump (though she has said she will vote for him).""Whatever personal antagonism we may have for rhetoric in this campaign, there's no 'buts' about it.

""'I feel your pain' is not just a cliche for him.""The Daily Mail reported that September's CGI drew ""fewer CEOs, stars and Republicans"" in its final year as allegations of corruption have hurt the organization's reputation and made it a liability during Hillary Clinton's presidential run.

Obama has wanted U.S. funding for overseas abortions, but has still resisted dismantling conscience protections for faith groups. Klein discusses how Clinton will manipulate around that.Klein writes:The groups have been advocating for changing the Helms Amendment to add exceptions for life of the mother, rape or incest (in other words, to clarify that despite the longstanding interpretation of Helms, while US dollars can1t be spent for abortion as a method of family planning these cases are not family planning.) The groups heard recently that the WH was prepared to go forward, but with two notable limitations. First, that any organization with a religious or moral objection would not be required to provide, pay for or refer for abortion. Second, that an organization that does not provide abortion services could not be discriminated against in the solicitation, application or granting of foreign assistance funds.Both of these pose problems, and in my view, leaving Helms intact is a better alternative at the moment. The conscience clause is at best odd and at worst harmful. Changing Helms would not require grantees to provide abortions at all, it would simply say that US funds can legally be spent in certain limited circumstances (life, rape, incest) and only in countries where abortion is legal. Since there is no affirmative requirement, why introduce the notion of a conscience exception?...In addition, the non-discrimination clause could be problematic. Again, there is no affirmative requirement that these services be offered so organizations that don1t provide them don1t need a leg up in the application process. (I1d even go one step further to argue that if Helms were amended so that abortions could be paid for in cases of rape, that factor should be considered in the application, given the reality that in many parts of the world, the USAID grantee is going to be the only health care available, and in some of those places (e.g., DRC) the availability of abortion in the case of a rape might be important.)""These changes are a problem, as a matter of substance and also as a matter of politics (including for H),"" concludes Klein. ""As I said, my intelligence suggests that the groups have effectively stopped this from going forward, but I wanted to be sure you are aware. Happy to talk to anyone further about this if it is helpful.""Clinton has also vowed to repeal the Hyde Amendment - which prohibits taxpayer funding of abortions in the United States - as the way to allow more access to abortion for low-income black and Hispanic women. At the same time, Clinton asserts that unborn babies have no constitutional rights.In January, Clinton said, ""I will always defend Planned Parenthood. And I will say - consistently and proudly - Planned Parenthood should be funded, supported, and appreciated; not undermined, misrepresented, and demonized.""The groups have been advocating for changing the Helms Amendment to add exceptions for life of the mother, rape or incest (in other words, to clarify that despite the longstanding interpretation of Helms, while US dollars can1t be spent for abortion as a method of family planning these cases are not family planning.) The groups heard recently that the WH was prepared to go forward, but with two notable limitations. First, that any organization with a religious or moral objection would not be required to provide, pay for or refer for abortion. Second, that an organization that does not provide abortion services could not be discriminated against in the solicitation, application or granting of foreign assistance funds.

We have a panel that people have opted into, of cell phone users only that we email, which is about 30 percent of our poll,"" he explained. ""The other 70 percent we do automated phone calls, where we call a random sample off the voter list, and then we ask the questions, people type in on their phone, 'press 1, press 2, press 3' for who they're voting for.""Kaplan admitted he was ""a little shocked"" by the dead-heat results of the latest poll.""We have some other polls in the field, not to disclose them at this point, but there's been a movement for Trump since the last debate,"" he said. ""Something changed in the race, and it's against the conventional wisdom. You see it in other polls, as well, where it's significantly changed, where he's closed the gap.""Kaplan attributed this movement to Trump picking up independents and Gary Johnson's voters ""going towards Trump. Also, he said he could see Trump ""consolidating the Republican base more, where he's getting 90 percent instead of 80 percent, so he's closing the gap, for sure.""""It's been better news cycles for him over the last week, since the debate,"" he added. ""A lot of the bad news, with the women and tape and all that, it's been out there for almost a month, which is probably good for him because now ... the focus is more about WikiLeaks or Podesta's emails, the Clinton Foundation, and those are all great issues for him. I think that that's why the Republican base is now going from 80 percent for him to 90 percent for him, and that's why you see the race much closer.""Marlow asked about poll ""weighting"" based on voter registration, which suggested a +7 Democrat advantage in the Breitbart News/Gravis survey, in line with the outcome of the 2012 election.""If you look at the exit polls after people vote, they're asked what party they're registered in. You look at the voter files, and you see if this amount of people voted, what party they were in, Democrat or Republican.

He described media bias as one element of a corrupt system, which had to be heavily rigged merely to keep Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail, instead of answering indictments in a federal court.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""So we have some things that are - we have the right points, and the press has been unbelievably unfair to us,"" Trump said.

You'll make a statement that is a perfect statement, and they'll find a way to take that statement, chop it up, and make it bad. It's incredible, actually. It's incredible.""He noted the press has given very little coverage to scandals like Clinton's involvement in the sale of twenty percent of America's uranium to Russia, even though Trump said that ""there has never been anything like it.""""To me, that's one of the worst things, and I don't know, it just doesn't seem to get picked up by anybody,"" he observed. ""They don't pick up a lot of things. They won't pick up all the things that came out yesterday. Now, one thing I will say: the WikiLeaks seem to be getting worse and worse. Do you agree with that? I mean, it seems like the initial ones were bad, but they seem to be getting worse and worse."" ""You know, one that you may disagree with me, but to me it was very important: when Donna Brazile had the answers to the debate, or the questions to the debate, and she gave them to Hillary Clinton. And Hillary Clinton used them, and didn't turn them in. I thought that was incredible,"" Trump exclaimed. ""That was, in terms of honor - so Donna Brazile got the questions to the debate, and she gave the questions to Hillary Clinton - this came out in WikiLeaks also, as you know - and Hillary Clinton, instead of saying, 'I'm sorry, I can't use these' and turning them in, Hillary Clinton used them and only got caught because of WikiLeaks.

""Hey, look: the FBI looked at many, many criminal events, including the deletion of 33,000 emails after she got a subpoena. She got a subpoena. She got a subpoena from the United States Congress, and then after getting the subpoena, she probably said, 'Oh, we gotta get rid of this stuff.' They deleted 33,000 emails.
