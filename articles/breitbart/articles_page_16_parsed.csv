""In fact, the headlines today, the New York Post, 'White House Open to Clinton Pardon.' Politico, the Washington Times on the other side, they won't rule out a pardon. There is, of course, strong precedent for it. When Richard Nixon was forced to resign, Gerald Ford gave him a complete and unconditional pardon not because he deserved it, but in his own words, to heal the country, to get rid of prolonged and divisive debate.""""The same thing might very well happen here. Interestingly, if Obama were moved to grant the pardon, it might not only help him and Hillary and the Democratic Party, but it might also help Trump,"" Banzhaf speculated. ""Maybe I'm naive, but I take both Obama and Trump's statements that they want to move forward, they want to heal, they want to get rid of the divisiveness."" ""Trump has said over and over and over again, a centerpiece of his campaign, that Crooked Hillary is a crook; she ought to go to jail; there ought to be a special prosecutor. I don't know whether he meant it or not, but if he goes ahead with that, and there is no pardon, that would be tremendously divisive,"" he said. ""On the other hand, it would be politically difficult for him, having made the promise to appoint a special prosecutor, to now say, 'Whoops, no, I changed my mind.' But if Obama were to pardon Hillary, that gives Trump an out,"" Banzhaf continued. ""He can say, 'Look,' to his people, 'I promised you that I would have a special prosecutor. I promised you I would put Crooked Hillary in jail. But Obama has given her, as Ford gave Nixon, a full and complete pardon for any crimes she may have committed, so my hands are tied. So let's put that aside, and then I can go ahead with all these other things I want to do.'"" ""We all know Trump is going to have a lot of opposition, a lot of divisiveness. Maybe he would feel he doesn't need this one extra thing,"" Banzhaf speculated.""What a sunset for the Clinton years in American life, if that's how it ends,"" said Marlow.Banzhaf closed out the interview by reporting that he was ""not aware of any significant voter fraud, anything which would have come near to affecting the outcome"" in the 2016 election. He and many other observers had feared such problems might occur, possibly even including a major foreign effort to hack into the American election system.""We were all worried about cyber-fraud and so on,"" he said. ""I think we were well-advised to take the extraordinary precautions that we did, and we ought to be continuing to work on that so that the next election is even safer, and we don't have to worry as much about the possibility of Russians or others possibly hacking and influencing the election.""Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.LISTEN:SIGN UP""I think it's more likely that Obama would,"" said Banzhaf.

Honda lost the endorsement of President Barack Obama, who decided to sit out of picking a candidate for that particular race.Conversely, Honda, 73, filed a lawsuit in the final weeks of the race, alleging that Khanna's campaign manager, Brian Parvizshahi, had hacked into a private computer system and illegally downloaded lists of financial contributions. Khanna was forced to fire Parvizshahi.Khanna, 40, a left-liberal progressive, had consistently called for new blood in Silicon Valley leadership. He received donations and endorsements from big tech names involved in companies such as Yahoo, Google, and Facebook.According to the Los Angeles Times, a spokesman for Honda's campaign declined to comment, saying the campaign would be releasing a later statement Wednesday.Meanwhile, in California's 7th congressional district, Democratic Rep. Ami Bera barely led Republican Scott Jones, leading for reelection by two percentage points, (51 % to 49 %).Jones sent out a tweet, with a full statement attached, Wednesday afternoon.

So I am proposing that just as we have black studies and women's studies and Hispanic studies and gay studies and so on at colleges, maybe we ought to have something like a blue-collar studies,"" he suggested.""Because many people at college, we as professors are totally insulated from the rest of the world.

In fact, the state's 58 County elections officials have almost a month, under the law, to have everything counted.As of today,  millions of ballots have yet to be counted. That said, when looking over the results of the statewide ballot issues, only one is really too close to call.So what did Californians decide to do with their biennial exercise in direct democracy?Some of the measures that passed include:Recreational use of marijuana was made legal, though pretty heavily taxed. Income taxes for the wealthy that were set to expire were extended. New tobacco taxes were passed, to now include vaping as well. Billions in school construction bonds were authorized, and voters narrowly approved a ban on plastic grocery bags. More gun control passed. Legislative transparency, and a controversial measure to relax sentencing of state inmates won the day. A return to bilingual education, and a new fee on hospitals, were green-lighted. Finally, with a margin too slim to call,  a measure to streamline, and make it easier to implement, the death penalty is slightly ahead.Rejected by voters was a requirement that revenue bonds go to a statewide vote for projects over $2 billion; redirecting paper bag taxes from grocers to environmental purposes; and requiring porn stars to wear condoms. A measure to end the death penalty was put to death. And, finally, a measure to impose price fixing on state purchasing of prescription drugs was defeated.Not surprisingly, Hillary Clinton is running up a huge, though meaningless, lead here, and Attorney General Kamala Harris defeated Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez in a Dem-on-Dem runoff for the United States Senate currently being held by Barbara Boxer, who is retiring.As of now it appears that Democrats have picked up enough State Assembly seats to have a supermajority in the lower house - but that Republicans will have retained just enough members to block a Democratic supermajority in the upper chamber.

And that progress is very much at stake. Donald Trump has vowed to ask Congress to repeal Obamacare on his first day in office. Meanwhile, our new vice president, Mike Pence, has favored legislation that mandates women who have abortions or miscarry bury or cremate fetal remains. Our reproductive healthcare is always under attack, but it's about to be a very scary time to have unreliable birth control. Enter, the IUD.IUDs, Elle continues, ""not only last between three and nine years, but can be removed whenever you decide to believe in the republic again.""Elle attempts to convince its readers that the pain of having an IUD inserted is nowhere near that of looking toward a Trump-Pence administration:Sure, they're not exactly a breeze to have inserted. But you're a woman! You're strong. You can manage the pain...And besides, which would you rather get all up in your uterus--a cutie device that will let you decide when and if to have children or the Trump-Pence administration?Trump has said that repealing and replacing Obamacare with free-market health insurance solutions that lower the costs of health care will be a priority. Groups such as Planned Parenthood, however, have been fierce advocates of Obamacare as they reap federal funding for handing out and inserting birth control methods.Had Hillary Clinton been elected president, Planned Parenthood likely would have achieved its goal of receiving direct federal taxpayer funds for abortions as well through Medicaid once the Hyde Amendment was repealed.In February, Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards touted that millions of women in the United States are now able to obtain birth control for free - that is, on the American taxpayer's dime - because of Obamacare.Need condoms but don't have $$ to buy them?

They're now doing their canvassing process,"" Woodhams says. ""Typically this process results in small vote shifts. That's common to every election.""""13,000 is a huge count of votes to change,"" Woodhams notes.Woodhams would not speculate as to why media outlets have not yet called Michigan for Trump. ""You would have to ask the media outlets that question.""Similarly, Woodhams could not explain why Politico is currently reporting a few thousand more votes in the state than the Michigan Secretary of State website is reporting, with a slightly different margin for Trump (11,423 versus 13,107).Politico currently shows Donald Trump with 2,279,221 votes in Michigan, and Hillary Clinton with 2,267,798 votes, giving Trump an 11,423 vote margin.The Detroit Free Press on Wednesday declared Trump the victor in Michigan by 13,225 votes, after prematurely and incorrectly calling the state for Hillary Clinton on Election Night with only 11 percent of the state's precincts reporting.A 13,107 vote margin of victory is not close enough to trigger a vote recount under Michigan law, as Citizens for Election Integrity reports:Recounts initiated by a close vote margin are mandatory if the close vote margin is triggered, but only at the statewide level. This requirement applies to both initiatives and candidates in any primary or election, except for partisan offices in which more than one person is elected. Mich. Comp. Laws 168.880(a)(1). Additional exceptions are noted in the Bureau of Elections ""Election Recounts"" manual (see page 5): The margin is set at 2,000 votes or less, regardless of the number of votes cast in the election, and when that margin applies, neither candidates nor voters would be required to file a petition as set forth below to initiate a recount.Few media outlets have yet called the election in either New Hampshire, where Clinton leads Trump by 1,437 votes with 100 percent of the precincts reporting, Arizona, where Trump leads Clinton by 84,526 votes with 100 percent of the precincts reporting, or Michigan, where Trump leads Clinton by 13,107 votes, with 100 percent of the precincts reporting.The current electoral college count, without allocating the electoral college votes of these three states, stands at 279 votes for Donald Trump, 228 votes for Hillary Clinton.Fox News called the election for Donald Trump at about 2:30 am eastern on Election Night/Morning, Wednesday November 9 when its decision desk determined that Trump had won Pennsylvania, giving him that state's 20 electoral college votes. Pennsylvania put him over the 270 electoral college votes necessary to win a majority of the electoral college's 538 votes.If New Hampshire's 4 electoral college votes go to Hillary Clinton, and Arizona's 11 electoral college votes and Michigan's 16 electoral college votes go to Donald Trump, as seems likely more than 36 hours after all polls have closed, the final electoral college tally will give Donald Trump 306 votes to Hillary Clinton's 232 votes, a resounding electoral college victory for President-elect Trump.Republican - Trump, Donald J. -  2,277,914 votes (47.60%)

""It is the highest share of the electorate made up of conservative Christians in a presidential election in the modern era,"" Reed said.""If these voters had stayed home, as some observers thought they would do, Donald Trump would have lost this election by a certain Johnson-Goldwater-type margin,"" he said. In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson beat Sen. Barry Goldwater (R.-Ariz.) with 61 percent of the vote to Goldwater's 39 percent. ""It's very, very significant.""In the 2016 cycle, it was a two-way street for Trump's outreach to conservative Christians, he said. No Republican nominee had ever made the consistent effort to connect with conservative Christians than Trump.The usual playbook is for the GOP to embrace conservative Christians in the primaries and then, in the general election push them off stage and off camera, out of fear that being close to conservative Christians would offend other communities that Republicans wanted to attract, he said. ""Trump did not use that playbook.""Reed said, ""We knew we were looking at something big, when we did our phone banking for our final weekend.""In the Faith & Freedom Coalition phone bank operation, a universe of 15.6 million conservative Christians living in 9.5 million households were identified in 11 key battleground states, he stated.The phone banks were tied to the outreach field operation that sent 26 million cell phone ads to 3.8 million targeted voters, Reed said. ""We were knocking on doors. We knocked on 1, 253, 778 doors in the top 11 states. We were distributing voter guides. We were dropping mail-all these things.""If voters replied they had turned in an early or absentee ballot, they would be taken out of the outreach program and the digital ads. Door knocks and phone calls would be directed at someone else. ""When we did our final purging for the final weekend, 48 percent of the entire universe had already voted,"" Reed said.""That included states like Pennsylvania and Michigan and many other states that don't even early-vote,"" he said. ""I had never in my career-and I have been doing this for 27 years-never seen an early vote number for this constituency that exceeded the mid-thirties, so we knew something big was happening.""The FFC analysis showed that broken out as a separate cross tab, Catholics contributed mightily to the overall Christian support for the New York City developer, he said.""Catholics are the swing vote in American politics,"" Reed said. White Catholics, who are one out of six voters, voted 54 percent for Trump and 36 percent for Clinton.Catholics helped Trump win Ohio, Iowa, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, he said.Broken out separately, the evangelical vote went for Trump by astonishing margins, Reed said: in Florida, by 85 percent to 13 percent; Georgia, by 88 percent to 6 percent; and Wisconsin, by 71 percent to 24 percent.After the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, evangelicals retreated from the public square, after being an active and accepted part of the process from the beginning of the Republic, he said. When Georgia Gov. James ""Jimmy"" E. Carter announced that he was a born-again Christian during his 1976 presidential race, it triggered a political reawakening for evangelicals, which have now reached an acceptance and a maturity after many years of awkwardness and resistance from other political players.There was no way of knowing how many people the Democrats would be able to drive to the polls, he said.It was obvious, however, that conservative Christians were going to swamp the polling stations, he said.""But, there was never any doubt in our mind-this was my tenth presidential cycle-I never seen a time, whether it was Obama in '08, whether it was Reagan in '80, or whether it was Trump this year, where the primary votes spiked, but those same voters did not turn out in the general,"" he said.""In my experience, if you vote in the primary, you're coming to the general, so we always believed they would come in huge numbers.""SIGN UP"	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]

But as you can tell from last night, probably not,"" one aide told The Hill.Despite losing Michigan to socialist Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primaries, Clinton assumed the state was a lock for her in the general election and didn't ""double down"" there.""The big question is 'How much money did you spend? And what's left in the bank?' Because there were states like Michigan that kept sounding the alarm and no one was taking it seriously until the very end. They never really got everything they wanted,"" a surrogate said.""We underestimated the Midwest,"" another aide said. ""I don't think we ever understood the political climate there. I know some are questioning why we never went there in the final days.""Russ Feingold reportedly told the Clinton campaign ""I need help,"" but was ignored. Feingold lost to Ron Johnson in a stunning Wisconsin Senate race upset.Before Tuesday's landslide, though, some Republicans believed a blue collar wave could sweep Donald Trump into the White House.""I think what's happening is that you're seeing demographic shifts that cross state lines. This shift reaches across Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania,"" Saul Anuzis, a former chairman of the Michigan GOP, told Breitbart News.""It is difficult to turn them out [on election day],"" he continued, speaking about blue collar voters. ""But the fact that they are willing to stand in line for hours [at Trump rallies] tells you something,"" he said. ""I would not be surprised if Trump won 40 states or lost 40 states -- if the wave of blue collars comes out, I can see him sweeping the states.""While Clinton's illicit use of a private email server to conduct business as Secretary of State and pay-to-play allegations swirling around the Clinton Foundation were ""albatrosses around the neck the campaign could never escape,"" nothing doomed her like her refusal to understand populism and nationalism sweeping across the Western world, aides admitted.SIGN UP"	['Sanders', 'Clinton', 'Hill', 'Trump']	[]

Mitt Romney's ballot-box support from African-Americans and Latinos.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERExit polls collected by CNN show Trump won at least 29 percent of the Latino vote in 2016, while Romney won only 27 percent in in 2012. The polls also show Trump won at least 8 percent of the African-American vote, while Romney won only 6 percent. That's a huge increase given the establishment's hostility directed at Trump, and it also contradicts the pro-amnesty claims made in business-backed GOP reports after Romney's failed 2012 run. The GOP's so-called autopsy report -- which was drafted, reviewed and reshaped by hundreds of business-funded consultants, lobbyists and pollster, declared: among the steps Republicans take in the Hispanic community and beyond, we must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform. If we do not, our Party's appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only. We also believe that comprehensive immigration reform is consistent with Republican economic policies that promote job growth and opportunity for all.In 2013, Trump ridiculed the autopsy when it was published..@RNC report was written by the ruling class of consultants who blew the election. Short on ideas. Just giving excuses to donors.-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 19, 2013During the subsequent immigration debate in 2013 and 2014, the GOP's base voters blocked the amnesty bill drafted by Democrats and business leaders. Those voters also defeated the GOP's majority leader, Rep. Eric Cantor, and subsequently picked Trump in the GOP primaries largely because of his opposition to amnesty. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio was defeated during the presidential primary, chiefly because of his support for amnesty -- and so he lost his chance to run against Hillary Clinton in 2016.When Trump's turn came on Nov. 8, 2016, he beat Romney's performance. The poll's details show that Trump won 13 percent of African-American men and 33 percent of Latino men, although he  won only 4 percent of African-American women, and 26 percent f Latino women.His performance may have been even higher, in part, because up to 7 percent of African-American men and up to five percent Latino men refused to tell pollsters who they voted for. In addition, people lie to pollsters. So Trump may have won 30 percent of Latinos and 12 percent of African Americans -- including 16 percent of African American men -- assuming that just half the undeclared vote went to Trump. In practice, those vote shares would have boosted his national vote by one percent from African-Americans and almost three percent from Latinos. That GOP performance among minorities is the best since 2004, when President George W. Bush won 40 percent of the smaller Latino vote during the economic bubble that had created so many temporary jobs for American Latinos and for illegal immigrants -- but which eventually allowed the election of President Barack Obama in 2016.Overall, African-Americans contributed 12 percent of the national vote in 2016, down from 13 percent in 2012, while the Latino share of the national vote nudged up from 10 percent to 11 percent, according to CNN.

""In fact, we go to great lengths to insulate our criminal justice system from partisan politics.""When Obama took office, many leftists wanted to see George W. Bush and Dick Cheney prosecuted for what they called ""war crimes,"" because of the use of enhanced interrogation techniques to question terrorists. But President Obama appeared reluctant to prosecute career law and intelligence officials in the Bush administration, citing in 2009 ""a belief that we need to look forward as opposed to looking backwards.""During a press conference, Earnest was reluctant to discuss potential pardons, insisting that it was improper to discuss them in advance. He did not rule out a potential pardon for Clinton but reminded reporters of Obama's discussion of pardons in August.When asked to reflect on his decision to commute the sentences of thousands of drug offenders, Obama indicated that he would not issue last-minute political pardons before leaving office. Any presidential pardons, he explained, would go through a rigorous legal process to avoid looking political.""It's going to be reviewed by the pardon attorney, it will be reviewed by my White House counsel, and I'm going to, as best as I can, make these decisions based on the merits, as opposed to political considerations,"" Obama said during a press conference.Earnest reasserted that Obama still felt the same way.""I wouldn't speculate at this point about what impact that may have on hypothetical pardon requests that he receives,"" he said. ""I'll just say that the guidance that President Obama shared with you is still operative.""But that doesn't preclude a decision by Obama to protect Clinton from further investigations. If the president views any prosecution of Clinton as politically motivated, he might step in to minimize the damage that she faces. But a political pardon risks tainting Obama's presidential legacy, something that Bush also avoided.When Dick Cheney demanded a pardon for his aide Scooter Libby, Bush refused, but commuted his sentence, keeping Cheney's aide out of jail. Libby still had to pay a $250,000 fine and serve probation for two years.Cheney vigorously pursued the case, accusing Bush of leaving a wounded soldier on the battlefield.""It was a hard decision to make,"" Bush said in 2010 about the case.

But troops have entered only a handful of neighborhoods in the east of the city.""We need to put wider pressure on the enemy in different areas,"" said Major-General Thamer al-Husseini, commander of the elite police unit which is run by the Shi'ite-controlled Interior Ministry.He said operations would resume within two days.Lieutenant-Colonel Dhiya Mizhir, also from the rapid reaction force, said the target was an area overlooking Mosul airport, which has been rendered unusable by Islamic State to prevent attackers using it as a staging post for their offensive.Army officers told Reuters in September the militants had moved concrete blast walls onto the runway to prevent planes from landing there.Satellite pictures released by intelligence firm Stratfor also showed they had dug deep trenches in the runways and destroyed buildings to ensure clear lines of sight for defenders and to prevent advancing forces from using hangars or other facilities.Forces advancing on the eastern side of the Tigris targeted two villages on Thursday on the edge of the ancient Assyrian city of Nimrud, a military statement said.Troops from the Ninth Armoured Division took the village of Abbas Rajab, four km east of Nimrud, and raised the Iraqi flag.The Iraqi government says Nimrud was bulldozed last year as part of Islamic State's campaign to destroy symbols which the Sunni Muslim zealots consider idolatrous. It would be the first such site to be recaptured from Islamic State.CLASHES IN EASTCounter terrorism forces and an armored division fighting in the east of the city have been battling to hold on to half a dozen districts they surged into a week ago.They have been hit by waves of attacks by Islamic State units, including snipers, suicide bombers, assault fighters and mortar teams, who have used a network of tunnels under the city and civilian cover in the narrow streets to wear them down in lethal urban warfare.Residents contacted by telephone on Thursday said aircraft from the U.S.-led coalition supporting the Iraqi forces were circling the skies above eastern Mosul. They heard the sound of heavy clashes, artillery and mortar fire.The militants were hitting back, they said. ""Daesh (Islamic State) fighters were firing mortar bombs from a garden next to us which they had taken from a Christian,"" one person said.""They were bombarding the Zahra neighborhood where the Iraqi forces are. The war planes hit back with small rockets and destroyed the mortar and killed three of them,"" he said, adding he had moved his family to another district.Counter Terrorism Service (CTS) forces have been fighting in Zahra for a week, sometimes gaining ground only to be pushed back on the defensive. A senior CTS officer said on Thursday the neighborhood was fully under control.""I'm very happy. I can't believe that we're over this terrible nightmare,"" said another resident who returned to Zahra after taking refuge outside the city. ""But we're still frightened that Daesh might return"".""We need more attacks on the other neighborhoods to liberate them and drive Daesh further away.""The militants, who have ruled Mosul with ruthless violence, displayed bodies of at least 20 people across the city in the last two days - five of them crucified at a road junction - saying they had been killed for trying to make contact with the attacking forces, residents have said.The United Nations has warned of a possible exodus of hundreds of thousands of refugees from the city. So far 45,000 have been displaced, the International Organization for Migration said on Thursday.Those figures exclude the thousands of people forced to accompany Islamic State fighters as human shields on their retreat back into Mosul from towns and villages around the city.SIGN UP"	[]	[]

Bush over John Kerry by only 5 percentage points. On Tuesday, Catholics nationwide favored Trump by a margin of 7 percentage points, with 52 percent voting for him as opposed to only 45 percent voting for Hillary Clinton.In the year 2000, 50 percent of Catholics voted for the Democratic candidate Al Gore as opposed to only 47 percent voting for George W. Bush. In 2004, Catholics shifted their weight to the Republican candidate, favoring Bush over Kerry by 52 percent to 47 percent. Four years later, Catholics again voted Democrat, with 54 percent supporting Barack Obama over only 45 percent for John McCain. Finally, in 2012, Catholics again leaned Democrat, with 50 percent voting for Obama as opposed to 48 percent for Republican candidate Mitt Romney.Multiple factors undoubtedly contributed to swaying Catholics to vote for Trump, but three stand out as particularly significant.First, in the lead-up to Tuesday's vote, a remarkable number of U.S. bishops spoke out strongly against voting for a pro-abortion candidate and singled out the ""Catholic"" Vice-Presidential candidate Tim Kaine for special reproach because of his public support for abortion.In October, Archbishop Joseph Naumann of Kansas called Kaine a ""cafeteria Catholic"" and questioned why he claimed to be ""personally pro-life"" while affirming his support of Roe v. Wade and consistently voting to keep abortion-on-demand legal.In the same month, Denver Archbishop Samuel J. Aquila told Catholics that life issues--and especially opposition to abortion--had to take absolute precedence in deciding whom to vote for in November's elections.""Catholics in good conscience cannot support candidates who will advance abortion,"" he wrote in the diocesan newspaper, The Denver Catholic.Then, in late October, Bishop William Murphy, head of the Diocese of Rockville Centre in Long Island, told Catholics that support for abortion ""should disqualify any and every such candidate from receiving our vote.""""Support of abortion by a candidate for public office, some of whom are Catholics, even if they use the fallacious and deeply offensive 'personally opposed but . . .' line, is reason sufficient unto itself to disqualify any and every such candidate from receiving our vote,"" he said in a letter that was read from the pulpit at every Sunday Mass in the diocese.Second, along with this vocal moral leadership on the part of numerous bishops, Mr. Trump himself launched a successful outreach to Catholic leaders, assembling an advisory board comprising Catholic politicians such as Rick Santorum and Sam Brownback, as well as a variety of other influential Catholic thinkers and public figures.Trump paired the naming of his Catholic advisory board with a vigorous letter-writing campaign to Catholic voters, underscoring his concern for issues dear to Catholics and his opponent's hostility to their causes. In a letter to participants at the Catholic Leadership Conference in Denver, Trump noted that Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine would move the White House away from Catholic concerns, especially religious liberty and pro-life causes.""On issues and policies of greatest concern to Catholics, the differences between myself and Hillary Clinton are stark,"" the letter said. ""I will stand with Catholics and fight for you.""Hillary Clinton has been openly hostile to these core Catholic issues for a long time, and is only going to be worse with Tim Kaine now following her lead,"" it continued.Trump also floated names of possible Supreme Court justices, offering guarantees that he would name conservative, pro-life judges.Third, the Wikileaks revelations of a deep-seated disdain for the Catholic Church on the part of members of Clinton's campaign team galvanized Catholics against the Democratic candidate, who had already shown herself to be at best insensitive and at worst outright antagonistic to Catholic moral issues.After the first leaks, the head of the U.S. Bishops Conference (USCCB) issued a stern statement decrying team Clinton's efforts to interfere in the Church's self-governance for ""short-term political gain.""The statement from Louisville Archbishop Joseph E. Kurtz came after news that John Podesta had set up two ""Catholic"" dummy organizations to exert influence over Church teaching in the wake of the Obama administration's HHS mandate and to bring about a ""Catholic spring.""In the emails, Sandy Newman, founder of the left-wing group, Voices for Progress, asked Podesta for advice on how best to ""plant the seeds of the revolution"" within the Catholic Church. In response, Podesta boasted that he had already founded two organizations for this purpose: ""Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good"" and ""Catholics United,"" a group accused in 2012 of seeking ""to silence the Church from speaking to the great moral issues of our age.""Kurtz suggested that Podesta's actions constituted a breach of religious freedom, ""one of the founding principles of our republic,"" which ensures the right of faith communities to ""preserve the integrity of their beliefs and proper self-governance.""Thus, while Donald Trump was reaching out to Catholics and aligning himself closely to their deepest concerns, the Clinton campaign seemed to be spitting in their faces.No wonder, then, that when push came to shove, Catholics came out forcefully on the side of the Republican candidate.Follow Thomas D.

One of the key recommendations: the party must ""must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform.""SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThere was virtually no discussion in the document of that highly controversial claim, which was made almost in passing, as if the party would swiftly reach consensus on immigration reform and pass it without much debate.That sentiment reflected the prevailing orthodoxy among conservative pundits, as well. On November 8, 2012 -- four years to the day before Donald Trump's amazing victory -- the estimable Charles Krauthammer wrote:Hispanics ... should be a natural Republican constituency: striving immigrant community, religious, Catholic, family-oriented and socially conservative (on abortion, for example).The principal reason they go Democratic is the issue of illegal immigrants. In securing the Republican nomination, Mitt Romney made the strategic error of (unnecessarily) going to the right of Rick Perry. Romney could never successfully tack back.For the party in general, however, the problem is hardly structural. It requires but a single policy change: Border fence plus amnesty. Yes, amnesty. Use the word. Shock and awe -- full legal normalization (just short of citizenship) in return for full border enforcement.Amnesty -- as soon as possible. That was the conventional wisdom in Washington. But conservatives surprised the GOP establishment by resisting amnesty, by insisting on debating the fundamental issue of who is to become an American, and how.And President-elect Donald Trump shocked the political world by riding to the presidency on opposition to amnesty.What the Republican establishment underestimated was how deeply Americans -- including key Democratic constituencies, and even legal immigrants -- resented amnesty. For some, it was a matter of economic competition. For others, it was a matter of the rule of law. And for others, it was a matter of cultural coherence.Regardless, Donald Trump reached voters that the GOP had long forgotten by promising to ""build a wall"" with a ""big, beautiful door.""It was not a call to xenophobia. It was a claim that the diversity that Americans have always cherished -- e pluribus unum -- rested on the foundations of secure borders, and law enforcement, and fairness.If we don't have a border, Trump argued, we don't have a country.Joel B.

Clinton, 69, who has made two failed bids at the presidency, is unlikely to be on the front lines of politics again. Her husband, Bill Clinton, 70, a former president who was widely expected to be the first husband to accompany his wife to the White House, likely will return to philanthropic efforts at his family's foundation.
""I'm glad the Clintons came along. They have contributed greatly to the country and the world,"" said Donald Fowler, a former Democratic National Committee chairman who's close to the Clintons. ""I think they will both be willing to help in the search for new leadership.""
The Clintons represented the rise and maturation of the baby boom generation, perhaps the most discussed, analyzed and self-referential generation in our country's history. In that sense, they were emblematic of its aspirations, as well of its outsized feelings of self-worth.

With the election behind him, President-elect Trump must now rise above divisive politics and side with the vast majority of Americans who demand equality for their LGBTQ friends, family, and neighbors. While disappointed, we are certainly not defeated; the pursuit of full acceptance will continue until everyone, no matter who they are or who they love, can simply live the life they love.The 2016 Republican Party platform says about marriage:The American family is the foundation of civil society and the cornerstone is marriage, the union of one man and one woman...we do not accept the Supreme Court's redefinition of marriage and we urge its reversal, whether through judicial reconsideration or a constitutional amendment returning control over marriage to the States.""We condemn the Supreme Court's ruling in United States v. Windsor, which wrongfully removed the ability of Congress to define marriage policy in federal law,"" the platform adds, continuing:We also condemn the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, which in the words of the late Justice Antonin Scalia was a ""judicial Putsch""--""full of silly extravagances""--that ""reduced the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mythical aphorisms of a fortune cookie."" In Obergefell, five unelected lawyers robbed 320 million Americans of their legitimate constitutional authority to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman.

To echo Scalia, we dissent.""We therefore support the appointment of Justices and judges who respect the constitutional limits on their power and respect the authority of the states to decide such fundamental social questions,"" the platform reads.In announcing his expanded list of potential Supreme Court appointees in September, Trump said in a press release:We have a very clear choice in this election. The freedoms we cherish and the constitutional values and principles our country was founded on are in jeopardy.
