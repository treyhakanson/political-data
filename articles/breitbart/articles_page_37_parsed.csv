Mike Pence began speaking to over a thousand people at a Halloween evening airport rally for the Trump-Pence ticket in Clearwater, Florida, every light in the place went out and Pence was left without power to his microphone.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe crowd that had boomed out cheers became chanting ""USA, USA, USA!"" For several minutes, the lights remained out and it wasn't long before someone brought Pence a megaphone and he continued his speech. The sound did not carry terribly far, but people listened and reacted as if they could hear him speak. Eventually dim lights began to come up and a flashlight was aimed at the podium.Power outage at Gov. @mike_pence  rally in #Florida where 1,000+ Trump-Pence supporters start chanting USA in the dark, Pence uses megaphone pic.twitter.com/BIGj7J54id-- Michelle Moons (@MichelleDiana) October 31, 2016Then the moment came when power to the microphone was restored to more booming cheers from the crowd. Pence told them, ""Ya know I'm here with the lights on, the lights off, the bullhorn, the flashlights because I'm here for this team. I'm here for this movement. I'm here for this cause today to make America great again.""The rally was momentarily interrupted when a U.S. Coast Guard plane rolled by.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER Let us be honest about who suffers from presidential misbehavior--it's the American people who pay the price, including the literal price of the expensive investigations. The odds of justice actually catching up with Hillary Clinton dwindle to almost zero if she gains the White House. She might have to sacrifice an aide here and there, but if the political system of 1998 couldn't remove her husband from office for blatant perjury, it's hard to imagine what could possibly bring The First Woman President down in the even more corrupt and confused political system of 2017.That being said, here are a few lingering legal headaches Clinton could face:1. Perjury: Why not start with a blast from the Clinton past? Hillary Clinton signed documents testifying that she turned over all work-related emails to the State Department, on orders from a federal judge, under penalty of perjury. We already have indisputable proof she violated this sworn statement... thousands of times.The cloud of false statements under oath surrounding Hillary Clinton is thousands of times thicker than the one around Bill. Democrats seem to have found a hidden clause in the Constitution that says Clintons can never be prosecuted for perjury, but Madame Secretary is really stress-testing that particular privilege of Clintonhood. One would think the federal judiciary had some interest in establishing that sworn documents must be taken seriously.2. Obstruction of Justice: Bill Clinton's primary motive for committing perjury was to obstruct justice--it was the second count in his impeachment. (The justice he was obstructing was a sexual harassment suit from Paula Jones, at a time when liberals insisted sexual harassment was the most overlooked, under-prosecuted crime in the legal code.)Hillary's thousands of perjury counts are also related to the obstruction of justice. She held back documents she didn't want Congress to see. She subverted the Freedom of Information Act, which is a law, not a lovely suggestion.  Most media timelines of the Clinton email scandal are either incomplete or deliberately obtuse, because they almost never accurately relate how her secret server was discovered. For example, these timelines from USA Today, CNN, and ABC News all get it wrong. Sharyl Attkisson, who was a participant in the story, has an accurate timeline that makes the important point Clinton-friendly media outlets don't want to talk about: we know about the secret server because the State Department was sued for failing to respond to FOIA requests. The State Department's official story is that they were surprised to discover Clinton was withholding thousands of documents on her private computer. That's straight-up obstruction of justice, in cases involving multiple federal courts, as surely as Bill Clinton's impeachable offense of obstructing the Paula Jones suit. Clinton may become untouchable if the American people allow her into the White House, but the lawsuits don't evaporate, and neither do the angry judges.3. Bribery: After the FBI set off a headline earthquake by re-opening the Clinton email investigation, we learned that several other FBI investigations of Clintonworld have been quietly in progress for some time. One of those investigations is digging into bribery allegations against the Clinton Foundation. The FBI agents working on these cases were reportedly very angry that top Bureau and Justice Department officials were pressuring them to drop their investigations.The most attention-grabbing of these suspicions concerns an FBI official, Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, whose wife received an inexplicably huge political donation from Clinton bagman Terry McAuliffe, currently the governor of Virginia. The timing of this donation was so convenient that even the Left side of the blogosphere has produced some uneasy speculation that McCabe probably should have recused himself from all things Clinton-related.Well, he didn't recuse himself, and the conflicts of interest are so apparent that the lack of a chiseled-in-stone quid pro quo might not be enough to kill this case off. After all, corrupt officials aren't usually dumb enough to write down their quid pro quo agreements, or repeat them into microphones. The McCabe controversy already has longer legs than most observers expected, when the news first broke.4. Pay for Play: There has also been recent confirmation that the FBI has investigated influence-peddling allegations against the Clinton Foundation, which was so obviously used for that purpose that it's funny to watch Clinton apologists insist nothing can be proven in a court of law. Some of the most vigorous infighting within the Bureau reportedly concerns whether pay-for-play investigations should move forward.WikiLeaks has exposed emails from Clinton insiders that openly discuss how the Foundation was part of a network that steered millions of dollars to ""Bill Clinton Inc."" Even longtime members of the Clinton syndicate professed themselves troubled by these operations. They were also unhappy with arrangements like Hillary Clinton's agreement to speak in Morocco after a $12 million donation to the Clinton Global Initiative.It's entirely possible that more documentation about these suspicious Clinton Foundation dealings will come to light after the election, especially if some of the people Clinton took money from grow upset with her. It's downright dangerous to have a President with so many strings attached.5. Illegal Use of a Nonprofit Organization: There are many laws governing the management of charitable organizations, generally intended to prevent them from becoming money-laundering operations, ripoff operations, and vehicles for political influence peddling. The Clinton Foundation and its galaxy of related operations may eventually find itself answering some questions about compliance with those laws, assuming the IRS decides to stop focusing its efforts on hassling mom-and-pop pro-life groups and kitchen-table Tea Party outfits. If the Foundation is ever held to account for any other impropriety, charges of abusing a nonprofit should be part of the legal package as well.6. Racketeering: Former prosecutor Andrew McCarthy has recently observed that Hillary Clinton's abuse of the State Department looks an awful lot like a ""racketeering enterprise,"" which could trigger the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1971, more widely known as RICO. McCarthy explained:Under RICO, an ""enterprise"" can be any association of people, informal or formal, illegitimate or legitimate - it could be a Mafia family, an ostensibly charitable foundation, or a department of government. It is a racketeering enterprise if its affairs are conducted through ""a pattern of racketeering activity."" A ""pattern"" means merely two or more violations of federal or state law; these violations constitute ""racketeering activity"" if they are included among the extensive list of felonies laid out in the statute.7. Fraud: Wall Street analyst Charles Ortel has been building a case that the ""Clinton Charity Network,"" as he calls the complete system of Clinton operations, has committed ""charity fraud of epic proportions."" In part, he refers to discrepancies between donor accounts and the Clinton Foundation's books. Others have pointed out how the Clinton Health Access Initiative has essentially ignored New York state law for years, without a peep from Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (who just happens to be part of the Clinton campaign's ""leadership council."") There are some interesting differences between the paperwork CHAI submitted to the IRS and what it submitted to the state of New York, which has more specific requirements about identifying foreign donors.In addition to getting a free pass on perjury, the Clintons are traditionally allowed to violate tax laws without penalty, eventually refiling paperwork when ""errors"" are discovered years after the fact. Another round of whoops-my-bad, no-harm-no-foul ""refiling"" during a Hillary Clinton presidency would be embarrassing, especially if she's busy trying to ratchet up taxes on everyone else.Under RICO, an ""enterprise"" can be any association of people, informal or formal, illegitimate or legitimate - it could be a Mafia family, an ostensibly charitable foundation, or a department of government.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIn North Carolina, early voting by African-Americans is sharply down, so ""you will see a very heavy push in this state for the African-American vote by Hilary Clinton to try to make up some of deficit,"" said Michael Bitzer, a professor of politics and history at Catawba College, in Salisbury, N.C. The push will likely include fly-ins by the Democrats' most popular speakers, he said, adding ""I would say [Hillary] Clinton, I would say President [Barack] Obama, probably another visit by Michelle Obama.""Nationally, ""African-American enthusiasm has dipped compared with that in 2012,"" according to the New York Times. That's ""a surprising and disquieting development for Democrats who believed Trump's racial appeals and flirtations with the birther movement would generate more urgency,"" the Times reported. For example, in the two Virginia districts with the largest percentage of African American adults, early voting has dropped by more than 50 percent, the Times said.In Ohio, the decline of early voting in heavily Democratic African-American districts is causing worry for Democrats -- and a shift of resources into the low-turnout areas. Hillary Clinton, according to the Blade newspaper, ""returns to Ohio on Monday with early-vote rallies planned in Cleveland and Cincinnati, and President Obama will rally in Columbus on Tuesday, also to encourage that early-vote turnout.""In Florida, ""the bad news for Clinton/good news for Trump is that African-Americans and millenials are voting considerably lighter -- so far - than four years ago,"" the Tampa Bay Times reported Oct. 31. Daniel Smith, a political science professor in Florida noted the rising level of early voting among whites and Hispanics, compared to to African-Americans. In Florida, thru Sunday Oct 30, 2016, Hispanics & Whites Outperforming 2012 Early Vote (EIP... https://t.co/cCZrJYkW0h pic.twitter.com/f4WgPmTYge-- daniel a. smith (@electionsmith) October 31, 2016In North Carolina, ""white voters are currently 72 percent of all absentee ballots cast, with black voters being 22 percent and all other races 6 percent. This represents a steady continuation of the trends that we have seen, with white voters over-performing their 2012 numbers and black voters under-performing their 2012 numbers,"" Blitzer said at his blog, Old North State Politics.The drop in African-American turnout is one of the few powerful pieces of data to emerge from election oversight offices in the states. Much of the data about early voting is too vague to show how the state's race is going, especially because early voters are only a small proportion of total votes in races where the two candidates may be only a few points apart.In Florida, for example, the state is releasing extensive daily reports about the numbers of early voters -- but that data doesn't show if early voters are leaning towards Trump or Clinton in the closely contested state. In addition, the state's population has been changed by the arrival of at least 50,000 people from Puerto Rico, and the pace of early voting has been accelerated by pressure from state election officials, as well as by GOP and Democratic get-out-the-vote campaigns.Moreover, Trump may be winning over a small but critical level of support from African Americans in Florida. According to the New York Times:Mrs. Clinton has had nearly unanimous support among black voters in Upshot/Siena surveys, but not in this [Florida] one: She had a lead of 81 percent to 11 percent. It might not seem like a big deal, but the difference between that support and the 90-1 we saw from black voters in Pennsylvania covers about half of Mr. Trump's lead.The data about a drop-off in early voting by African Americans is predictive and useful because Obama got more than 90 percent of their votes in 2099 and 2016.

Mrs. Clinton has had nearly unanimous support among black voters in Upshot/Siena surveys, but not in this [Florida] one: She had a lead of 81 percent to 11 percent. It might not seem like a big deal, but the difference between that support and the 90-1 we saw from black voters in Pennsylvania covers about half of Mr. Trump's lead.
SIGN UPA blizzard of early reports show that by early voting by pro-Democratic African Americans has dropped significantly compared to 2012, giving a boost to Donald Trump's prospects in critical swing-states, such as North Carolina and Ohio. In North Carolina, early voting by African-Americans is sharply down, so ""you will see a very heavy push in this state for the African-American vote by Hilary Clinton to try to make up some of deficit,"" said Michael Bitzer, a professor of politics and history at Catawba College, in Salisbury, N.C. The push will likely include fly-ins by the Democrats' most popular speakers, he said, adding ""I would say [Hillary] Clinton, I would say President [Barack] Obama, probably another visit by Michelle Obama.""Nationally, ""African-American enthusiasm has dipped compared with that in 2012,"" according to the New York Times. That's ""a surprising and disquieting development for Democrats who believed Trump's racial appeals and flirtations with the birther movement would generate more urgency,"" the Times reported. In Ohio, the decline of early voting in heavily Democratic African-American districts is causing worry for Democrats -- and a shift of resources into the low-turnout areas. Hillary Clinton, according to the Blade newspaper, ""returns to Ohio on Monday with early-vote rallies planned in Cleveland and Cincinnati, and President Obama will rally in Columbus on Tuesday, also to encourage that early-vote turnout.""In Florida, ""the bad news for Clinton/good news for Trump is that African-Americans and millenials are voting considerably lighter -- so far - than four years ago,"" the Tampa Bay Times reported Oct. 31. Daniel Smith, a political science professor in Florida noted the rising level of early voting among whites and Hispanics, compared to to African-Americans. The drop in African-American turnout is one of the few powerful pieces of data to emerge from election oversight offices in the states. Much of the data about early voting is too vague to show how the state's race is going, especially because early voters are only a small proportion of total votes in races where the two candidates may be only a few points apart.In Florida, for example, the state is releasing extensive daily reports about the numbers of early voters -- but that data doesn't show if early voters are leaning towards Trump or Clinton in the closely contested state. In addition, the state's population has been changed by the arrival of at least 50,000 people from Puerto Rico, and the pace of early voting has been accelerated by pressure from state election officials, as well as by GOP and Democratic get-out-the-vote campaigns.Mrs. Clinton has had nearly unanimous support among black voters in Upshot/Siena surveys, but not in this [Florida] one: She had a lead of 81 percent to 11 percent. It might not seem like a big deal, but the difference between that support and the 90-1 we saw from black voters in Pennsylvania covers about half of Mr. Trump's lead.But even that data can also be offset by other shifts in the electorate, such as the rising number of Latino voter and the rising percentage of political independents.

Trump, told reporters Monday that he supports Trump because of his stands on the large issues facing the country.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""Nobody would say Donald Trump is a humble man,"" said Peter Thiel, whose winning investments include Facebook and PayPal. ""But, the big things-he is right about.""Thiel said he appreciates what the America people appreciate about Trump, in that he understands what the problems are and what has to be done about them.Trump is grounded in reality, not ideology, he said.""He doesn't think the force of optimism alone can change reality without hard work-just as much as it is about making America great,"" he said.Trump's agenda is about making America a normal country,"" he said. ""A normal country does not have a half-a-trillion-dollar trade deficit. A normal country does not fight five simultaneous undeclared wars. In a normal country, the government actually does its job.""In the same way, after being asked about Trump's pledge to ban Muslims from coming into the country, Thiel said he personally would not support a religious-based test, but that was not actually what Trump was trying to communicate.Trump's point was that there is something dangerous about Islamic terrorism and Americans need to get a handleon it before it causes the country more trouble, he said.""The press always takes him literally, but never seriously,"" he said, while the people take him seriously but not literally.Thiel said he is a political libertarian, but he is not an anarchist.""Today, it is important to recognize the government has a job to do,"" he said. ""Voters are tired of hearing conservative politicians saying government never works. They know government was not always broken.""There are three solid examples of this, he said. ""The Manhattan Project, the Interstate Highway System, the Apollo program-whatever you think of these ventures, you cannot doubt the competence of the government.""But it has been 40 years since the federal government has approached that level of competence, he said.Today in Washington, there are too false choices: Do more with more or do less with less, he said. ""What about doing more with less?""Thiel said: Look at the F-35 fighter jet, a multi-billion dollar project that produced a jet that cannot fly in the rain. ""Why don't we find a less expensive fighter that flies in the rain?""The technology investor addressed reporters at Washington's National Press Club, reading from two left-right teleprompters. After his remarks, Thiel, who wore a gray business suit with an open shirt collar, took questions from NPC President Thmas Burr, a reporter with the Salt Lake City Tribune, from cards submitted by the audience. This is the custom at the press club, where when reporters make the rules there is no shouting of questions. When it was over, Burr presented Thiel with a National Press Club coffee mug.Thiel said Trump's approach to governing is a ""New American Politics"" that rejects the old order and must be embraced to turn the country around.""When the distracting spectacles of this election season are over and the history of our time is written, the only important question will be whether or not that New Politics came too late.""SIGN UP"	['Trump', 'Burr']	[]

Clinton are crippling her campaign-and will cripple her presidency if she beats her GOP rival Donald J. Trump.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSchilling, whose show is broadcast weekdays from 9 a.m to 11 a.m. online at Breitbart.com, told Stranahan that he was blown away by the leg work that the reporter puts into his stories.
Call into the show: (877) 240-1776The fireballer asked Stranahan: ""Can you kind of bring people up to speed about where you are and where we are as a country?'Stranahan said, ""What is interesting right now is that we are at the intersection of four different stories with this email scandal right now--that all connect--and they are all stories that the mainstream media did not want to touch.""The first scandal is Anthony Weiner sexting explicit texts and photos to a minor in North Carolina, which the mainstream media wanted to completely ignore, he said.Weiner's first scandal involved the then-congressman sending obscene photos of himself to women through Twitter in 2011. Andrew Breitbart was in the middle of exposing that scandal, along with Stranahan.""Andrew Breitbart had to fight tooth and nail and I was part of the team five years ago, when we broke that story,"" Stranahan said.The investigation into Weiner led FBI agents to thousands of emails belonging to his wife Huma Abedin. Abedin was born in the United States but raised in Saudi Arabia. Abedin returned to the United States when she was 18-years-old and soon thereafter met Clinton and joined her staff. ""She has been Hillary Clinton's top assistant for 20 years-that's who she is-she has never had a job that does not involve Hillary Clinton.""Stranahan said the third scandal is the FBI investigation into how Clinton handled sensitive electronic correspondence during her tenure as secretary of state. It was that investigation that FBI Director James B. Comey Jr. told Congress Friday that he was re-energizing because new information was discovered.It was an investigation that Comey in effect closed July 5, when he recommended that the Department of Justice decline to prosecute Clinton.Stranahan said the reason Comey had to reboot the investigation was the incredible internal pressure within the FBI. Current and former agents felt that Comey had botched the investigation, so they started leaking information from it.""Then, yesterday morning, it was revealed on one of the Sunday shows that the FBI is also investigating the Clinton Foundation,"" Stranahan added.Anyone who has seen the documentary Clinton Cash knows that the foundation was the facility for the Clinton family's pay-to-play schemes of selling off government policies, ambassadorships, and even arranging arms deals, according to Stranahan.After laying out those four scandals, Stranahan said it was important to go back to Abedin, who had a unique work arrangement that allowed her to be an employee of the State Department and the Clinton Foundation at the same time.This work agreement put Abedin in the perfect position to keep things connected between the two Clinton-controlled spheres--the foundation and the State Department, he said.Another special arrangement for Abedin was that there were only three email accounts set up on the Clinton private server: Clinton herself, her daughter Chelsea Clinton, and Abedin.Because Clinton never used her State Department email address, any and all emails Hillary Clinton sent during her tenure as Secretary of State were on her private server and, because Huma had her own account on the server, the entire universe of their electronic correspondence would be held on that server and none of it would have passed trough the State Department-or later on to the National Archives.All of these scandals and factors, combined with the various FBI agents in different field offices, mean Clintons' troubles are not going away, Stranahan said.""This is like a tsunami coming at Hillary Clinton in the last week of the campaign and there is nothing they can do to stop it,"" he said.Whatever It Takes broadcasts live weekdays from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. on Breitbart.com and is hosted by three-time World Series champion Curt Schilling.SIGN UP"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

Why must they always disgrace and defile and destroy them? Is it simply that they cannot resist taking complete advantage of anyone who comes to them so young and impressionable?Famously, the Clintons encouraged the romance and union between The Weiner and their intern. The former intern surely envisioned herself and The Weiner as a budding power couple tightly orbiting the famous and powerful Bill and Hillary Clinton.Remember the opulent and glamorous photo shoot under the trees in wedding attire that ran in some glossy fashion magazine? And Bill Clinton officiated the nuptials? (NOTE: Kids, if you are thinking of getting married and Bill Clinton is the guy performing your wedding ceremony, you might ask yourself whether this is the healthiest of relationships you're getting into.)I remember the first time I met The Weiner. It was on Capitol Hill years ago before he became such a disgrace that even Congress would not have him anymore. We dined at a restaurant a few blocks from the Capitol.He was, of course, loud and obnoxious. But what really struck me was how glued he was the entire time to his BlackBerry, even some 10 years ago. He couldn't put it down at the table and kept getting up to walk outside with it. And that was back before the ""selfie"" was even invented!The public pinnacle of The Weiner's love affair with The Weiner was the release earlier this year of the documentary called, well, what else? ""Weiner.""Chronicling his hubristic and disastrous run for mayor of New York City, the documentary is a lurid and queasy glimpse into the most intimate and private moments in the lives of political whores. Both wife and child are trotted around extensively for endless public humiliation.Throughout the film, there is tension between Ms. Abedin and The Weiner. There is talk of lots of therapy and forgiveness and even failure to forgive. There are moments so intensely personal that even The Self-Loving Weiner himself asks the camera crew to step out of the room so he can talk with his wife in actual private.And then it comes out that The Weiner is still being The Weiner after all the lies and false apologies.All the while, Ms. Abedin is still getting instructions from Clinton World on how much she should allow herself to be used and trotted around by The Weiner. Too bad the couple's young child didn't have somebody looking out for him.The train wreck is finally complete when The Weiner is about to concede his fifth-place loss and learns that a woman whom The Weiner was sexting (a porn star appropriately code-named ""Pineapple"" by the campaign) is lying in wait for The Wiener, in the flesh, and in public.Ms. Abedin expresses reservations about joining in on such fun, but The Weiner insists that she must join him at the very mountaintop of public humiliation after hustling through the back door of a dirty fast-food joint to avoid ""Pineapple.""In the final moments, in the back of the darkened SUV, The Weiner releases her and tells her to go home. The Weiner is wounded and angry and full of rage.In one of the final scenes of the movie, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio is being sworn into the office that The Weiner so desperately wanted so he could return to the regular orbit of the powerful Clinton World. Swearing in Mr. de Blasio is none other than Bill Clinton himself.In this twisted world, hell hath no fury like a Weiner scorned.* Charles Hurt can be reached at charleshurt@live.com; follow him on Twitter via @charleshurt.SIGN UP"	['Clinton', 'Hill', 'Hurt']	[]

""The Turkestanis, in addition to being pro-Turkish, are Sunni and could be a useful tie-breaker in the event of a future conflict.

I think that's factored into that people think and now they're choosing a president.""But for people in the intelligence community -- including disgruntled FBI agents and even former officials in the Pentagon, it's not that easy.The revival of the Clinton email scandal reminds them of just how exposed Clinton left highly classified information.Last September, an FBI report noted the bureau couldn't find proof her private email server was hacked into by adversaries. But it noted that the private server had to be shut down repeatedly because of hacker attacks and a successful attack wasn't likely to have left fingerprints.  Also, some ""hostile foreign actors"" were able to break into the personal email accounts of Clinton's close aides, obtaining a treasure trove of emails exchanged with her personal account.Note that so far none of the WikiLeaks revelations have come from Hillary's personal account. That could mean it wasn't hacked, or it could mean that ""hostile"" actors are waiting to make use of them.Given the growing suspicions that the Clinton Foundation may have exchanged favors with the Clinton State Department, her private server could be of great interest in establishing such links.In short, we have to acknowledge the danger that Hillary Clinton could be the target of international blackmail in the White House.Read the rest here.SIGN UP"	['Clinton']	[]

The poll carries a 1.7 percent margin of error with a 95 percent level of confidence. PA Oct 27 v3 (1) by Breitbart News on Scribd""This poll has a very large sample and by taking it over a number of days we feel it is a realistic snapshot of the race in Pennsylvania,"" said Doug Kaplan, the managing director of Gravis Marketing, the Florida-based polling company that conducted the poll.""It is remarkable how unpopular both candidates are,"" he said. ""Both Clinton and Trump have 46 percent of the people telling us that they have a 'strongly unfavorable' opinion of them.""Kaplan said Libertarian Gary Johnson was the choice of 3 percent and Green Party nominee Dr. Jill Stein was the choice of 2 percent.In the Senate race, Republican Sen. Pat Toomey trails his Democratic challenger Katie McGinty with 41 percent to her 45 percent, he said.""One big take-away is that we were in the field with the poll, when the FBI news broke Friday,"" he said. ""But, there was already a negative feeling about how the FBI handled Clinton's private emails.""Friday, James Comey notified Congress that the FBI had more documents that it was reviewing in relation to its investigation into Clinton's handling of sensitive electronic correspondence, while she was the secrethaary of state. Comey announced July 5 that he was recommending to the Department of Justice that its prosecutors should decline the opportunity to prosecute Clinton.Poll participants were asked: The FBI has concluded that Hillary Clinton potentially exposed top secret information to hostile countries when she used a private email server when she was Secretary of State but the agency has decided not to seek a criminal indictment of her. Which is closer to your view?Fifty-one percent said Comey's recommendation was incorrect and 42 percent said the decision was correct.In the 2012 presidential campaign, W. Mitt Romney lost Pennsylvania and its 20 electoral votes to President Barack Obama with 47 percent of the vote to the president's 52 percent.In 2008, Sen. Barack Obama (D.-Ill.) beat Sen. John S. McCain III (R.-Ariz.) with 54 percent to McCain's 44 percent.Inside the poll, there is a strong indication that Pennsylvania voters are looking for change.Fifty-five percent of Pennsylvania voters polled said America is going in the wrong direction with 37 percent saying the country is going in the right direction. It is a result that lines up with when the respondents were asked if the next president should continue the policies of the Obama administration or make a change, 57 percent said change and 37 percent said to continue Obama policies-an interesting twist for the man, who was the ""Change"" candidate in 2008.The poll was conducted  interactive voice responses, with the results weighted to match a proprietary turnout model.SIGN UP"	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Toomey', 'Romney', 'McCain', 'Obama']	[]

Bernie Sanders (I-VT).At the time, Brazile was not yet DNC chair, but was a regular CNN contributor.CNN fired Brazile on Monday, releasing a statement: """"We are completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor.""Trump noted that Brazile was not the core issue -- ""I don't care"" about her, he said. Rather, he argued, Hillary Clinton should have reported Brazile the first time she tried to pass debate questions to her.Trump also talked about cheating at the polls, telling supporters that the only way to overcome voter fraud would be to vote by the ""millions.""He cited 1.8 million dead people on the country's voter rolls, and 2.75 million who are registered in more than one state. (The statistics appear to be based on a Pew Research Center study.)Trump challenged journalists in the room to ask Hillary Clinton why she had not reported Brazile after being provided with the debate questions.Joel B.

Later, he challenged the media to ask Hillary Clinton why she didn't report Brazile at the time. (The revelations cost Brazile her CNN job on Monday.)Shortly thereafter, Knight re-emerged to tout Trump's respect for the military, and added -- despite the live television and radio coverage of the speech: ""In a Donald Trump administration, there will be no bullshit.""Trump also talked about his ""new deal for black America,"" which he introduced last week in Charlotte, North Carolina.
