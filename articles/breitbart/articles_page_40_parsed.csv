He continued:One was to cover the uninsured, of which we've covered 20 million, the largest expansion in American history. The other was to fix broken insurance markets where insurers could deny people insurance just because they were sick or they had been sick. Those have been fixed, and for the vast majority of Americans, costs in those markets have come down, thanks to the subsidies made available under Obamacare.But doctors who value the private decision-making process between physician and patient without government intrusion say Gruber's comments underscore for them that Obamacare was never about health care, but about achieving another Progressive goal of massive wealth redistribution.""Jonathan Gruber exposed himself as not credible and simply a propaganda minister of Obamacare when he was exposed explaining the grand deception perpetrated on the American public,"" Dr. Gerard Gianoli, a specialist in neuro-otology and skull base surgery, tells Breitbart News. ""To claim that Obamacare is working is almost too ridiculous to comment upon, unless the purpose of Obamacare was to drive up insurance premiums, while providing less options for health care and destroying the best medical care system in the world.""In 2014, Gruber testified before the House Oversight Committee that Obamacare's designers took advantage of the ""stupidity of the American voter."" Now, Gruber says the law is working just fine since most Obamacare customers won't be paying the higher premiums because they qualify for subsidies.""85% of people buying insurance on the exchanges get subsidies,"" Gruber said. ""And for those people, this premium increase doesn't affect them.""What he didn't say is that other people will be paying for those subsidies through higher taxes.Gianoli explains:Gruber's comment of insurance coverage for those who were uninsured is utter nonsense. The vast majority - 85 percent - of those who have signed up for insurance through the Obamacare exchanges are individuals who would have previously qualified for Medicaid but hadn't applied. Why? Because they simply didn't need it. They weren't sick. So, to claim that this is some huge accomplishment to have these folks sign up for insurance and forcing the taxpayers to foot the bill is a travesty. It is simply sending money to the insurance companies for no purpose other than to improve their bottom line at the expense of the taxpayer.Dr. Jane Orient, a specialist in internal medicine, tells Breitbart News she is ""surprised"" Gruber agreed to another interview, given the fact he finally revealed the deceptions he used to achieve the adoption of Obamacare.""If Obamacare is working as intended, then it was intended to destroy medical insurance and private medicine,"" Orient says, referring to the notion that Obamacare was designed to fail so that a single-payer, totally government-controlled health care system would then replace it.""How can an economist say a product is affordable when 85% of exchange subscribers get a taxpayer subsidy?"" she asks. ""And lots of people refuse to buy it because it is so overpriced - so harsher punishment is needed to get them to 'participate' in being ripped off.""Gruber said Obamacare could ""work better"" if the individual mandate ""penalty"" were larger.""We have individuals who are essentially free-riding on the system; they're essentially waiting until they get sick and then getting health insurance,"" he said. ""The whole idea of this plan, which was pioneered in Massachusetts, was that the individual mandate penalty would bring those people into the system and have them participate. The penalty right now is probably too low, and that's something I think ideally we would fix.""To many doctors, however, ""larger penalties"" to induce compliance doesn't translate into health  care.""Obamacare-compliant plans are not really insurance, and they violate all the principles of insurance, as an MIT economist surely knows,"" Orient says. ""They are a wealth redistribution scheme. Insurance is voluntary, and premiums are priced according to risk.""Orient would like to see Americans purchase their own health insurance.She explains:Most medical care should be paid for at the time of service by the person receiving the service. Health insurance should be like casualty insurance (auto, homeowner's, life), which is affordable - you hope you never have to use it, instead of expecting to use it constantly. If we replaced managed-care plans pretending to be insurance with true insurance, medical prices would drop like a rock, instead of inflating like a bubble - and some say ""health care,"" which is mostly not medical care, is indeed a bubble.Dr. Lee Vliet, a preventive medicine physician, tells Breitbart News Gruber's admitted deceptions to the American people have led to destruction in the daily lives of Americans - and some of them are not even customers of Obamacare.""Patients and physicians are struggling daily with the rising cost of health insurance, reduced coverage and benefits, high deductibles, and long delays for access to treatment,"" she explains. ""Many patients can't afford to pay for the medical care until they reach their deductible so they're putting off going to the doctors and their health problems are getting worse.""""Obamacare has been a nightmare of draconian regulations and interferences with physician and patient decision-making,"" Vliet adds. ""It has been a disaster for the economy and one of the leading causes of the loss of jobs in the United States since 2010.""However, Secretary of the Department of Health & Human Services Sylvia Burwell says Obamacare cannot be repealed.""Why I believe that repeal is not an option is because this is in the fabric,"" Burwell told Politico in July.She continued:The idea that you are going to pull out the thread of insurers not being able to deny over preexisting conditions? Don't think so. The idea that you are going to pull out the thread of 20 million people who have coverage? The idea that you are going to pull out that thread of, ""Oh, you're going to go back to paying for your contraception, and you're going to go back to paying for your flu shot, and I'm going to pay for my kids' wellness visits?"" No.But Gianoli says if Obamacare is allowed to remain its costs will continue to soar and there will be fewer and fewer options for consumers.""Until there will be no insurance option at any price,"" he stresses. ""When only sick people sign up for health insurance, it's not insurance.""""Obamacare is in a death spiral and no amount of propaganda or raising the penalty/tax will save it,"" he adds. ""The question on the table is what will replace it once the collapse is complete.""One was to cover the uninsured, of which we've covered 20 million, the largest expansion in American history. The other was to fix broken insurance markets where insurers could deny people insurance just because they were sick or they had been sick. Those have been fixed, and for the vast majority of Americans, costs in those markets have come down, thanks to the subsidies made available under Obamacare.Gruber's comment of insurance coverage for those who were uninsured is utter nonsense.

Democrats and NeverTrump Republicans are apparently thrilled.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe long-sought-after antisemite apparently emerged from seclusion at a Trump rally in Arizona on Saturday afternoon (which this reporter missed, ironically, because of the Jewish Sabbath). He chanted ""Jew-S-A!"" at the media in the back.A video of the altercation, posted on Twitter by Nick Corasaniti of the New York Times, show a rather unhinged person.Guy chants ""Jew-S-A"" in front of press pen pic.twitter.com/2yqgA6dD4k-- Nick Corasaniti (@NYTnickc) October 29, 2016After a campaign in which Hillary Clinton operatives have planted all kinds of people at Trump rallies, with the deliberate intent of inciting violence and grabbing media attention, the incident cannot be taken at face value. But presume, for argument's sake, that the poorly-coiffed fellow really is the scumbag he is purporting to be.No one reported when Trump rally attendees shouted their support for Israel in Ohio on Thursday (this reporter heard it once in Toledo and again in Geneva). No one, except Breitbart News, spoke to a very obvious Orthodox Jew at an Ohio rally -- about this very topic:Mordechai Giffin, 32, an Orthodox Jew from the Cleveland suburb of University Heights, spoke to Breitbart News about the accusation that Trump, and his campaign, were antisemitic.""It's just a stereotype,"" Giffin said. ""There's no evidence of it. His daughter's an Orthodox Jew and his son-in-law is Jewish."" Giffin, who owns a business in the area of the rally, told Breitbart News his main motivation for supporting Trump was his preference for ""conservative government.""The idea of using one crazed individual to judge millions of people is absurd. There are antisemites and racists and homophobes et cetera who support Hillary Clinton -- the father of the Orlando terrorist is one who comes to mind -- but the media never presume that they are representative of the whole.On Sunday morning's edition of CNN's State of the Union, Jake Tapper grilled Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, and claimed Trump ""has never seriously said, 'I don't want the support of those people'."" She rejected that -- and she is right. Trump said in August 2016 that he does not want white supremacists to vote for him (via The Hill); he also said of David Duke in August 2015 that ""I certainly don't want his endorsement"" (via Bloomberg). That was six months before Tapper asked him about Duke, and created a controversy where none had existed.Has Hillary Clinton ever been asked to disavow her support from Black Lives Matter, which has an explicitly antisemitic platform accusing Israel of ""genocide""? That's not just a random crazy person at a rally -- it's the official view of a well-known organization whose support she has, in fact, sought.And recall that when Barack Obama was -- belatedly -- challenged to disavow his racist pastor, Jeremiah Wright, he gave a speech declaring he would not. The media compared him to Abraham Lincoln and said his speech should be taught to first-graders.This is an old, tired game. The media and Democrats used it against the Tea Party, falsely alleging that someone shouted the ""N-word"" at black members of Congress during an anti-Obamacare rally. Now they are using it against Trump and his fans.The fact that it took so long for the media to find -- finally! -- one lunatic is a testament to the decency of Trump supporters, and Americans in general.Joel B.

President Tayyip Erdogan (pictured) will directly appoint the rectors from the candidates nominated by the High Educational Board (YOK).Turkey has formally arrested more than 37,000 people and has already sacked or suspended 100,000 civil servants, judges, prosecutors, police and others in an unprecedented crackdown the government says is necessary to root out all supporters of Gulen from the state apparatus and key positions.A state of emergency imposed right after the bloody failed coup in July has been extended for another three months until January after Erdogan said the authorities needed more time to eradicate the threat posed by Gulen's network as well as Kurdish militants who have waged a 32-year insurgency.The total number of media outlets shut down since the start of the state of emergency has now exceeded 160.The extent of the crackdown has worried rights groups and some Western allies, who fear Erdogan is using it to curtail dissent. The government says the actions are justified by the threat to the state on July 15, when more than 240 people died.Ankara wants the United States to detain and extradite Gulen so that he can be prosecuted in Turkey on a charge that he masterminded the attempt to overthrow the government. Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999, denies any involvement.SIGN UP	[]	[]

The other thinks it's a joke.But these are more than just random positions adopted by maverick presidential candidates to please their more extreme voters. They are in fact expressions of one of the fundamental differences between the right and the left, which is reflected time and again in the polls: Conservatives, Libertarians and Republican voters are much, much less likely to think that man-made global warming is a problem than Labour voters, liberal-lefties, greenies and Democrat voters.In one poll last year, for example, 64 percent of Democrats professed to believe in man-made global warming, as against 22 percent of Republicans.This is something the left likes to mischaracterise as stemming from the ""anti-science"" tendencies of right-wing people. But that's just smear tactics. Conservatives are generally more sceptical of climate change (and related environmental scare stories) for a number of reasons which I discussed in a recent speech in Birmingham at the Conservative Party Conference to the Cornerstone group. You can watch the edited version here.One of the reasons is religious. If you are a conservative, you are more likely to cleave to the old Christian religion. If you're on the left, you're more likely to believe in the new one - environmentalism or Gaia-worship.Many facets of the new religion are merely substitutes for aspects of the old religion.The crucifix has been replaced by the wind turbine; priests have been replaced by climate scientists; false prophets by the likes of Al Gore and Prince Charles; hair shirt penance and daily ritual by recycling; pilgrimages and purgatory by IPCC conferences; and so on.Conservatives naturally feel towards environmentalism as they do towards Scientology or pastafarianism or Jedi: why subscribe to a silly, made-up new religion when you've got a much preferable one sanctified by 2000 years of history?But even conservatives who aren't remotely religious are instinctively sceptical of environmentalism for several other sound reasons.One is that conservation is built into most conservatives' DNA - indeed, it's actually in the name of their political philosophy. Conservatism is about conserving what is best, whether it's traditions, institutions or nature. (I go into a bit more detail about this in my speech, which you should watch because it's very short and there's a funny bit in the middle where I'm interrupted on the phone by the former Environment Secretary Owen Paterson).Another is, yes, that we on the right are naturally suspicious of any ""problem"" which can only be apparently fixed by massive state intervention, higher taxes, increased regulation, policing by nanny-ish busybodies - and bombing the economy back to the Dark Ages. ""Citations needed"", we say to all that. And amazingly, the greenies can't supply them - well, not convincing ones, anyway.The other main reason people on the right are distrustful of the whole ""climate change"" scare is that conservatism is essentially evidence-driven. That is, it's not about grand schemes for reforming the world - such as the left is forever trying to inflict on us. It's about looking at the real world and working with human nature rather than against it. It's about ""if it ain't broke, then don't fix it"".When I gave my speech, I got into a bit of a spat with the beardie academic who came on after me and tried to imply that I was only saying all this anti-environmentalist stuff because I believed in free markets and therefore just didn't give a damn about nature.""I'm sorry my point wasn't clear,"" I replied. ""I thought I'd spent the first part of my speech spelling out in some detail why it is that conservatives make the best conservationists, and why we value real world evidence more highly than politicised speculation. But let me - sigh - reiterate my case in language a complete idiot is capable of understanding.""They don't like it up 'em, the greentards.

""Spending by Egyptian tourists does not cover our daily expenses.""The bazaar's cafeterias and restaurants are empty save for some Egyptian families and strolling students.A few tourists hopped off two buses parked at a plaza in front of the nearby Hussein mosque, but most returned without buying any souvenirs.""Tourism has totally died,"" said Abdel Rahman, a salesman at a large store specialising in lanterns and inscribed silver chandeliers.A family of European tourists enters the shop and haggles over a small lamp. They leave empty-handed.""The few tourists who do come almost always don't buy anything,"" said Abdel-Rahman, turning off the light to save on his electricity bill.Traditionally, tourism has provided about 20 percent of Egypt's foreign currency needs.In February, Prime Minister Ismail Sharif told state television the country had already lost up to $1.3 billion since the airliner disaster.Even before the Russian plane disaster, the tourism industry had been badly hit.-'War on terrorism'-In June 2015, police foiled an attempted suicide bombing near the famed Karnak temple in Luxor -- one of Egypt's most popular attractions -- while 600 tourists were inside.In September the same year, eight Mexicans were mistakenly killed by security forces in the vast Western Desert.Last year, tourist numbers plunged by more than half, to 6.3 million, compared with 15 million in 2010. The number from Russia fell to 2.3 million, from 3.1 million in 2014.At the same time, tourism revenues dropped by 15 percent to $6.2 billion in 2015, compared with the previous year, according to official figures.The government aims to attract 20 million tourists, with revenues of $26 billion, by 2020, through an international campaign to promote Egypt and develop tourist sites.Egyptian authorities say they are in a ""war on terrorism"" since the military overthrow of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013 unleashed a jihadist insurgency.President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the former army chief, has vowed to restore order, but attacks have persisted, especially in the Sinai Peninsula.Jason Shi, a Chinese citizen in Egypt on a business trip, said he could not resist visiting the historic landmarks.""We got a warning from our foreign ministry not to visit Sinai or to stay late in the streets or approach security premises,"" he said outside Cairo Museum.""But I cannot miss this opportunity to visit famous places like the pyramids and Old Cairo,"" said Shi, who was accompanied by a Mandarin-speaking tourist guide.Sherif Ibrahim, a 59-year-old waiter at a kebab restaurant in Khan el-Khalil, doubted the prospects of a recovery.""No tourist in their right mind would come to Egypt,"" he said.

The building contained two prisons and many prisoners along with security forces have been killed in the strikes, the officials said.The city is under control of Yemen's Shiite Houthi rebels who have seized the capital and much of the northern region in 2014. The Houthis' TV network al-Masirah said that 43 people were killed in the airstrikes but it was not immediately possible to verify its account.The airstrikes came hours after warplanes rained bombs on houses of civilians in the western city of Taiz, killing at least 18 people, including children, earlier in the day.The latest airstrikes come at a time Yemen's president in exile has turned down a UN peace deal aimed at ending the country's devastating conflict, saying it ""rewards"" Yemen's rebels.The proposed peace deal gives the Houthi rebels -- who seized the capital Sana'a in 2014 and eventually forced President Abed-Rabbo Mansour Hadi out of Yemen -- a share in the future government. It also reduces some of the president's powers in exchange for a rebel withdrawal from major cities.Hadi made his remarks during a visit by the UN Envoy to Yemen Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on Saturday.""The Yemeni people have condemned these ideas and the so-called road map out of belief that the deal is a gateway to more suffering and war,"" a statement by the presidency quoted Hadi as saying.""The ideas presented ... carry the seeds of war,"" he added. ""It rewards the coup leaders and punishes the Yemeni people at the same time.""The statement said Hadi told Ahmed that peace is only attainable when the rebel ""coup"" is reversed, based on a UN Security Council resolution that stipulates the rebels must lay down their weapons and withdraw from cities as a precondition to any peace agreement.A presidency official told The Associated Press that Hadi has come under heavy international pressure to accept the deal. He said that ambassadors of the United States, France, China and Russia have held meetings with Hadi and his prime minister in the past 24 hours to press him to accept the deal. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.The conflict in Yemen has left more than 10,000 dead and injured and displaced nearly 3 million people. The Arab world's poorest nation had already been suffering from high rates of malnutrition, and the war and a blockade imposed by a Saudi-led military coalition have pushed the country deeper into starvation and turmoil.Rights groups have accused the Saudi-led coalition of killing civilians, while trying to target rebels. Weddings, funerals, schools and hospitals have been bombed in the past year.Witnesses say a car bomb exploded Saturday in the southern city of Aden at a checkpoint steps away from the central bank, which had been relocated recently from the rebel-held capital of Sana'a.The bomb wounded three soldiers and caused panic in the busy commercial district of Crater, the witnesses said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of security concerns.Aden is the temporary capital of the internationally-recognized government which was forced out of Sana'a by the rebels in 2014. A Saudi-led military coalition has since intervened and continues to battle the rebels alongside forces loyal to Hadi. This summer, Hadi ordered the relocation of the country's central bank from Sana'a to Aden, amid accusations that the rebels were misusing state funds.Also on Saturday, two families of 18 people were killed when warplanes bombed their houses in a southern district called al-Salw, in the war-torn western city of Taiz.Taiz, the cultural center of Yemen, has been torn between coalition-backed forces and the Houthi rebels for the past year and a half. The district that came under attack is close to the front line, and officials said that it is often difficult to distinguish rebels from government forces.The fighting between the two sides intensified in al-Salw in recent days and many families have fled their homes.The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of security concerns.SIGN UP"	[]	[]

They included one man picking up a Trump lawn sign who was furious about all of the California license plates he saw outside one Democratic office.""Just because you have more money and more people than we do doesn't mean you have the right to tell us how to vote,"" said the man, who refused to give his name.Nevada has a total of 6 electoral votes.Meanwhile, the Fresno Bee reports that illegal aliens -- including ""Dreamers"" brought to the U.S. by their parents when they were minors -- are registering voters in California's Central Valley, even though they themselves cannot vote.While Clinton is expected to win California easily, there are several closely contested congressional races, including the race between incumbent Rep.

They stop dreaming. They stop trying. When the powerful can get away with anything ... then people lose confidence in our laws and confidence in their futures,"" the real estate billionaire said.""Hillary Clinton's corruption is destructive  to the soul of our nation and it must be stopped,"" he added, to shouts of ""Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!"" from the enthusiastic crowd.""This was the scene of my first major speech right after I announced that I was running for President,"" Trump said.""We had fifteen thousand. We have more than fifteen thousand [today],"" he added.""The silent majority is back,"" Trump told the crowd.""In ten days we are going to win the state of Arizona, and win back the White House,"" he said.""A Trump administration will immediately repeal and replace Obamacare,"" the GOP nominee said, turning to one of the two major themes of the night.Trump pointed out the specifics of the failure of Obamacare in Arizona.""The citizens of Arizona are going to experience a 116 percent increase in their Obamacare premiums ... and it doesn't work!"" he said.""Elect me and we will stop the premium hikes for good; we will stop the madness of Obamacare,"" Trump promised.""In Phoenix there are eight Obamacare insurers gone. Next year you'll have one group to negotiate with,"" he noted.Trump added that Obamacare rate hikes are even worse in Phoenix than the rest of the state.""In Phoenix, Obamacare premiums will go up 145 percent,"" he said.Rate hikes aren't the only problem with Obamacare in Arizona. Deductibles are skyrocketing, Trump noted.""One insurer in this state will have a 14,000 dollar deductible!"" he said.""Obamacare is a catastrophe for Arizona and a catastrophe for the United States,"" Trump added, noting that ""even Bill Clinton admitted it.""Trump then turned to Friday's stunning announcement by FBI director James Comey that the agency was reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was Secretary of state.""It was just announced yesterday that the FBI was reopening their investigation into the criminal conduct and illegal conduct of Hillary Clinton,"" Trump said.""Hillary has nobody but herself to blame for her mounting legal difficulties. Her actions were willful, deliberate, intentional, and purposeful,"" the GOP nominee said, delivering the same blistering critique of his opponent's actions he had earlier in the day at a rally in Colorado.""She set up this illegal server knowing full well her actions put our national security at risk,"" Trump said.""But she didn't care,"" he added.""As long as she and Bill got the money, the safety of your family made no difference to her,"" Trump asserted.""To cover up her crimes ... she bleached and deleted 33,000 emails ... after receiving a Congressional subpoena, made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer, lied to Congress under oath many times, lied to the FBI many times,"" he said.Clinton's corruption problems, Trump said, will continue if she gains higher office.""Hillary put the office of Secretary of State up for sale. If she ever got the chance she would put the Oval Office up for sale ...""  he said.Trump also blasted a politicized Department of Justice.""The Department of Justice is fighting with the FBI. That's because the Department of Justice is trying their hardest to protect the criminal activity of Hillary Clinton,"" he said.Trump noted that 97 percent of the contributions to presidential candidates from employees at the Department of Justice went to Hillary Clinton.""There are those, and I happen to be one of them, that think Hillary Clinton offered Loretta Lynch a reappointment as Attorney General if she becomes president,"" he said.""Perhaps that was what Bill Clinton was arranging when he met with Loretta Lynch on her plane on the tarmac right here in Arizona. It was just a coincidence he was here to play golf,"" he added.""It was 109. It was a very hot day. He just happened to see her,"" he noted skeptically.Trump gave short shrift to the claim Clinton was there to play golf, noting that he golfs in Arizona often and that when it's 109 degrees, he and his friends decide to stay inside and not play golf.Trump said the accidental nature of the meeting on the tarmac lacked credibility.""I've had a plane for a long time. Never once has anyone said from the tarmac, 'Hey can I come on in?'"" he said.""So they spent 39 minutes talking about golf and their grandchildren. I give golf two minutes, grandchildren three minutes,"" Trump said, adding that the remaining 34 minutes were spent working out a deal to clear Hillary.""This is what I mean when I say our system is rigged,"" he added:A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote to surrender our government to corruption and graft.Hillary's corruption shreds the principles on which our nation was founded.Government corruption spreads outward like a cancer.When you delete 33,000 emails after getting a subpoena, it's over.""Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!"" the crowd shouted again.""The only reason they [the FBI] did this action was very, very serious things were happening and must have been found,"" Trump said.""Why wasn't this evidence given previously?"" Trump asked.""Hillary Clinton should never be allowed to run for president of the United States. We have one ultimate check on Hillary Clinton's corruption, that's the power of voting on November 8,"" Trump added.""USA! USA! USA!"" the crowd responded.""Haven't we had enough drama with the Clintons?"" he asked.""Look at the mess she's in with these emails. That will last for years. Do you think that is going away?"" he asked rhetorically.""This will be the year the American  people say enough is enough,"" Trump asserted.""My contract with the American voter begins with a pledge to end government corruption,"" he said.""When we win on November 8, we are going to Washington, D.C. and we are going to drain the swamp,"" the Republican nominee promised.""Drain the Swamp! Drain the Swamp! Drain the Swamp!"" the crowd shouted.A traditionally Republican state, a number of recent polls have suggested Arizona may be in play in the presidential contest next Tuesday between Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The most recent poll, conducted by Monmouth University between October 21 and October 24, shows Trump with a one point lead, which is within the margin of error.The dynamics of the presidential election, however, changed dramatically on Friday, when FBI director James Comey made his announcement the agency was reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while Secretary of State.Trump was preceded by several local speakers, the most surprising of whom was Carl Mueller, the father of Kayla Mueller, the 26-year-old graduate of the University of Northern Arizona who was kidnapped and killed by ISIS.""Kayla was held for 18 months,"" Mueller told the respectful audience.""She was held in solitary confinement. She was beaten, raped, and killed by ISIS,"" Mueller said, adding that his daughter watched as 18 other western hostages were released due to the efforts of their governments.""We communicated directly with ISIS many times. We put all our faith in our government to bring Kayla home,"" Mueller said, adding:In our desperate efforts to save our daughter, we pleaded with the administration to do what we needed to do to save our daughter, but they blocked us every time. It's time for a change.We cannot afford another four years of the same failed policies.We need a leader who will take a stand ... a leader who will defend this nation, its Constitution, and its people.I find it refreshing to hear a candidate running for president speak his mind, not worried about political correctness.""I have voted, and I have voted for Donald J. Trump,"" Mueller declared.""Trump! Trump! Trump"" shouted the crowd.""I encourage all of you do to the same. It's up all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to make America a greater place to be,"" Mueller concluded.A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote to surrender our government to corruption and graft.
Hillary's corruption shreds the principles on which our nation was founded.
Government corruption spreads outward like a cancer.
When you delete 33,000 emails after getting a subpoena, it's over.In our desperate efforts to save our daughter, we pleaded with the administration to do what we needed to do to save our daughter, but they blocked us every time. It's time for a change.

Clinton, just rebooted by the FBI, will not go away after the Nov. 8 election-especially if she wins the White House.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIf the campaign between Clinton and her Republican rival Donald J. Trump was fought on the issues, Trump would win and the next big question would be how to handle criminal charges against the former first lady, he said.""Somebody has got to ask her: If she is elected will she appoint a special prosecutor, nominated by an impartial panel of judges? Will she guarantee the American people she will not pardon herself?"" he said.Boyle jumped in to add: ""Also, I think, President Obama has to be asked if he'll pardon her.""""I am shocked nobody has mentioned it,"" Caddell said.""One thing we do know, this is not going away,"" he added.""Immediately, she is going to be consumed into this kind of scandal-is that what the American people want the presidency to be come the next term?"" he asked Boyle and the listeners. Breitbart News Saturday is heard on SiriusXM The Patriot Channel 125.Boyle said to Caddell that during the 1998 impeachment crisis, President William J. ""Bill"" Clinton, the husband of the 2016 Democratic nominee, promised that he would not give himself a pardon.It was an issue that Slate addressed at the time with the help of a team of law professors and the Congressional Research Service:The simplest interpretation is that the president can pardon any federal criminal offense, including his own, but cannot pardon an impeachment. In other words, Clinton is free to immunize himself from criminal prosecution, but has no power over Congress.A competing interpretation is that the power to pardon ""except in cases of impeachment"" means the president cannot pardon someone who's been impeached, or at least cannot pardon the offenses which led to an impeachment. This interpretation not only prohibits Clinton from self-pardoning, it also prohibits a future president (e.g. Al Gore) from pardoning Clinton.The article points out that while the president is powerless to pardon an individual impeached and convicted, if President Clinton pardoned himself for other crimes, it would be up to the courts to decide whether to accept the pardon as valid or not.Another consideration is whether an individual must accept a pardon or not. This became an issue when President Gerald R. Ford issued a pardon to his immediate predecessor Richard M. Nixon for crimes that may or may not have been committed during his tenure.Nixon was never impeached by the House, so his case was never adjudicated by the Senate. Thus, as it stood unresolved, Ford wanted to immunize Nixon for his return to private life, and his staff convinced him that Nixon had to formally accept it, which he did.According to a commentary for the University of Virginia's Miller Center on the circumstances of the Nixon pardon: ""Nixon was reluctant to accept the pardon because it implied guilt but his friends and advisers warned him that any legal battle would be protracted and expensive and it would be very hard to find an impartial jury or receive a fair trial.""Caddell said the Watergate break-in, along with other scandals, were already in the news in 1972, but they had not reached critical mass until after the election.""In 1972, when Nixon won a landslide. more than anything Reagan ever won, I was on the receiving end of that with McGovern,"" said Caddell, the pollster for Sen. George McGovern (D.-S.D), the challenger to Nixon.""Afterwards, the bottom dropped out on Watergate, the entire second Nixon administration became a question of whether he was going to be impeached or not,"" he said.The American people need to wrestle with the fact that even if Clinton is elected president, she will still have to address the email scandals and all the others that are surrounding it, such as the Clinton Foundation and the things revealed in WikiLeaks, Caddell said.Caddell said President Barack Obama has been central to so many scandals himself.""He has lied about everything,"" he said. ""This is a man who has presided over the Justice Department, the IRS investigation, who says: 'Oh, I'm going to get to the bottom of it' and then, 'Oh, there's nothing there.'""The president has abused his executive authority in ways Nixon only wished he could use, Caddell said.Comparing the media's treatment of Obama and the Clintons with the way the media treated Nixon, the pollster and political consultant said it was night and day.The same media outlets that hounded Nixon out of office are now laying down for Obama and the Clintons, he said.Caddell said in both the national and state Breitbart/Gravis polls, voters are asked if the media is biased.Overwhelmingly, the public sees the the bias, especially in favor of Clinton over Trump, he said. ""Ten-to-one in our national poll-they're not stupid, the American people.""An0ther poll question asked if the media's bias is a threat to the public's right to know and to American democracy-or is the media acting normally and their behavior is not a threat? ""Again, we are dealing with a solid majority of Americans, including Hillary Clinton supporters admit it,"" said Caddell.The simplest interpretation is that the president can pardon any federal criminal offense, including his own, but cannot pardon an impeachment. In other words, Clinton is free to immunize himself from criminal prosecution, but has no power over Congress.
A competing interpretation is that the power to pardon ""except in cases of impeachment"" means the president cannot pardon someone who's been impeached, or at least cannot pardon the offenses which led to an impeachment.

Comey revealed his decision in a letter to Congress after he'd gotten evidence that important emails were found on a laptop computer used by both Abedin and her estranged husband, Anthony Weiner.The June deposition of Abedin was conducted by the watchdog group, Judicial Watch. During the questioning, their attorneys asked Abedin ""How did you go about searching for what records you may have in your possession to be returned to the State Department?""""I -- I looked for all the devices that may have any of my State Department work on it and returned -- returned -- gave them to my attorneys for them to review for all relevant documents. And gave them devices and paper.""Judicial Watch followed up with Abedin and the deposition transcript shows the following exchange, with Abedin answering under oath:Q Okay. And what devices did you return for your attorneys to look through with respect to federal records you may have had in your possession to be returned to the State Department?MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Beyond the scope.A My -- if my memory serves me correctly, it was two laptops, a BlackBerry, and some files that I found in my apartment.Q Okay. The BlackBerry that you returned, is that a BlackBerry that was associated with your Clintonemail.com account?A Yes.MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Beyond the scope of discovery.THE WITNESS: Sorry.MR. BRILLE: That's okay. Just take a second.MR. BRILLE: That's okay. You're okay. You're doing fine. Just take a little bit of a pause.Q Was your answer yes, Ms. Abedin?A The answer is yes.Q Okay. Thank you. And the two laptops that you returned, or you gave to -- provided to your attorneys to look through, did they have e-mails from the Clintonemail.com account?MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Beyond the scope of authorized discovery.A: I was not involved in the process. I -- I provided them with the devices and the materials an asked them to find whatever they thought was relevant and appropriate, whatever was their determination as to what was a federal record, and they did. They turned materials in, and I know they did so. I couldn't tell you from what device.In the deposition, Abedin also admitted to using her Clintonmail.com email for ""State-related matters.""The deposition also contained other examples of noteworthy conduct. As Breitbart News reported previously:During the quizzing, Abedin was asked, ""And during your tenure at the State Department, were you aware of your obligation not to delete federal records or destroy federal records?""Her reply was astonishing.""If there was a schedule that was created that was her Secretary of State daily schedule, and a copy of that was then put in the burn bag, that . . . that certainly happened on . . . on more than one occasion,"" Abedin said during the meeting.In August, the Daily Caller reported that an email showed Abedin once left one of these burn bags in the front seat of her car:""Favor"" is the subject of Abedin's July 20, 2009 email to Lauren Jiloty, Clinton's personal assistant. Judicial Watch obtained the records and hundreds more pages of Abedin emails as part of its ongoing Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the State Department.""I'm going to have ambassador ride on next drive,"" wrote Abedin. ""There's a bunch of burn stuff in the pocket of my front seat.""Other details beginning to emerge also raise concerns about whether Abedin's apparent security lapses are indicative of a deeper problem.As Breitbart News has reported, Abedin has never faced serious mainstream media scrutiny over her background such as Abedin's myriad connections to the Muslim World League, a Saudi Arabian Islamist ""charity."" In 2009, Hillary Clinton herself admitted the charity is one of the Saudi organizations that ""continue to send money overseas and, at times, fund extremism overseas.""Paul Sperry reported in the NY Post about an April 5th of interview of Abedin that was attended by the ""chief of the FBI's counterespionage section:""On page 3 of their 11-page report, the agents detail how they showed Abedin a classified paper on Pakistan sent from a State Department source which she, in turn, inexplicably forwarded to her personal Yahoo email account -- an obviously unclassified, unencrypted, unsecured and unauthorized system. The breach of security was not an isolated event but a common practice with Abedin.""She routinely forwarded emails from her state.gov account to either her clintonemail.com or her yahoo.com account,"" the agents wrote. Why? ""So she could print them"" at home and not at her State Department office.Despite the growing web of concerns, in a statement given to DailyMail.com, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said that the campaign continued to support Abedin:Huma completely and voluntarily complied with and cooperated with the investigation.

There's absolutely nothing she's done that we think calls into question anything that she's done.  She's been fully cooperative. We of course stand behind her.Even the Daily Beast was forced to acknowledge how Huma Abedin's unique position with Clinton might be protecting her from investigation:In a normal election year, a normal candidate's close aide who caused even minor embarrassment to a campaign so near to Election Day would be whisked away as quickly as possible to avoid becoming a distraction.But Huma Abedin is not simply a close aide, she's a critical member of Hillary Clinton's tiny inner circle that protects and -- at times -- enables the deeply flawed and secretive Democratic nominee.The new emails were discovered in the course of an investigation into whether Anthony Weiner allegedly exchanged sexually oriented texts and photos with a 15-year-old North Carolina girl, including one message where he said ""I would bust that tight pussy so hard and so often that you would leak and limp for a week.""""I -- I looked for all the devices that may have any of my State Department work on it and returned -- returned -- gave them to my attorneys for them to review for all relevant documents. And gave them devices and paper.""Q Okay. And what devices did you return for your attorneys to look through with respect to federal records you may have had in your possession to be returned to the State Department?
MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Beyond the scope.
A My -- if my memory serves me correctly, it was two laptops, a BlackBerry, and some files that I found in my apartment.
Q Okay. The BlackBerry that you returned, is that a BlackBerry that was associated with your Clintonemail.com account?

THE WITNESS: Sorry.
MR. BRILLE: That's okay. You're okay. You're doing fine. Just take a little bit of a pause.
Q Was your answer yes, Ms. Abedin?
A The answer is yes.
Q Okay. Thank you. And the two laptops that you returned, or you gave to -- provided to your attorneys to look through, did they have e-mails from the Clintonemail.com account?
MS. WOLVERTON: Objection. Beyond the scope of authorized discovery.
A: I was not involved in the process. I -- I provided them with the devices and the materials an asked them to find whatever they thought was relevant and appropriate, whatever was their determination as to what was a federal record, and they did. They turned materials in, and I know they did so. I couldn't tell you from what device.During the quizzing, Abedin was asked, ""And during your tenure at the State Department, were you aware of your obligation not to delete federal records or destroy federal records?""
Her reply was astonishing.
""If there was a schedule that was created that was her Secretary of State daily schedule, and a copy of that was then put in the burn bag, that . . . that certainly happened on . . . on more than one occasion,"" Abedin said during the meeting.""Favor"" is the subject of Abedin's July 20, 2009 email to Lauren Jiloty, Clinton's personal assistant. Judicial Watch obtained the records and hundreds more pages of Abedin emails as part of its ongoing Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the State Department.
""I'm going to have ambassador ride on next drive,"" wrote Abedin. ""There's a bunch of burn stuff in the pocket of my front seat.""On page 3 of their 11-page report, the agents detail how they showed Abedin a classified paper on Pakistan sent from a State Department source which she, in turn, inexplicably forwarded to her personal Yahoo email account -- an obviously unclassified, unencrypted, unsecured and unauthorized system. The breach of security was not an isolated event but a common practice with Abedin.
""She routinely forwarded emails from her state.gov account to either her clintonemail.com or her yahoo.com account,"" the agents wrote. Why? ""So she could print them"" at home and not at her State Department office.Huma completely and voluntarily complied with and cooperated with the investigation. She sat for a hours long interview. She turned over and went through with her lawyers all of the emails that might possibly be relevant and turned them over to the state department and investigators. There's absolutely nothing she's done that we think calls into question anything that she's done.  She's been fully cooperative. We of course stand behind her.In a normal election year, a normal candidate's close aide who caused even minor embarrassment to a campaign so near to Election Day would be whisked away as quickly as possible to avoid becoming a distraction.
But Huma Abedin is not simply a close aide, she's a critical member of Hillary Clinton's tiny inner circle that protects and -- at times -- enables the deeply flawed and secretive Democratic nominee.SIGN UP"	['Clinton']	[]

Nine percent said ""neither"" or ""other,"" and three percent were not sure. Of Clinton supporters, 45 percent said they support her ""primarily because of her qualities as a candidate,"" and 26 percent said they support her ""primarily because I want to stop Trump from becoming President."" Of Trump supporters, 39 percent said they support him ""primarily because of his qualities as a candidate,"" and 30 percent said they support him ""primarily because I want to stop Clinton from becoming President.""Clinton's Pennsylvania lead is only one half percentage point outside of the poll's margin of error. That's a bad sign for Democrats for a state that has swung blue since 1988.Likewise, Clinton is hanging onto a lead in Wisconsin by only one point outside of one new poll's margin of error. There, Clinton also leads Trump by six percentage points in a race that includes third-party candidates, according to an Emerson College poll released Saturday, 48 percent to 42 percent. Clinton took out ads in Wisconsin for the first time this election season, according to the Associated Press, signaling her campaign is concerned about polling in the traditionally blue state that's voted for Democratic presidential candidates since 1984.In Florida, Emerson College found the two candidates locked in a statistical tie, with Clinton leading Trump 46 percent to 45 percent in a race that includes third-party candidates. The two were also in a statistical tie in North Carolina, where Clinton leads Trump 48 percent to 45 percent in a race that includes third-party candidates.In Ohio, Emerson College found the two candidates in a dead heat, with 45 percent support each, in a race that includes third-party candidates.In Nevada, Emerson College found the two candidates locked in a statistical tie, with Clinton leading Trump 44 percent to 42 percent in a race that includes third-party candidates.If Pennsylvania breaks for Trump, those 20 electoral votes could put him over the 270 threshold. A Wisconsin upset would deliver 10 crucial electoral votes. Florida, with 29 electoral votes, is another must-win swing state that will cinch the election.The Muhlenberg College/Morning Call survey questioned 420 likely Pennsylvania voters from Oct. 20 to Oct. 26, with a margin of error of plus or minus 5.5 percentage points.Emerson College pollsters questioned 400 likely Wisconsin voters from Oct. 27 to Oct. 28, with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points. They questioned 500 likely Florida voters from Oct. 27 to Oct. 28, with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.3 percentage points.

Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson had only one percent support, and three percent of voters were undecided.The poll of 1,301 registered voters across Florida has a 2.7 percent margin of error. The one point differential between Clinton and Trump is within that margin of error.Floridians who responded to the poll had strong views on the direction of the country, Obamacare, immigration, and refugees.Fifty-five percent want the next president to change the direction of the country and pursue new policies, while 38 percent want to continue Barack Obama's policies.A whopping 68 percent disapprove of Hillary Clinton's proposals  to increase the number of Syrian refugees arriving in the United States by more than 500 percent, from 10,000 in 2016 to 65,000 in 2017. Only 19 percent approve of Clinton's proposals to increase the number of Syrian refugees. In the latest national poll conducted by Breitbart/Gravis, 63 percent oppose increasing the number of Syrian refugees, while 26 percent approve of Clinton's proposals to increase that number.Fifty-two percent do not believe that Syrian refugees arriving in the United States have been subjected to the most rigorous security vetting, as the Obama Administration claims, while 33 percent believe the Obama administration's claims.Fifty percent agree with Donald Trump that NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, is the worst trade deal in modern American history, and that TPP, the TransPacific Partnership, is almost as bad. Twenty-eight percent disagree.Fifty-five percent say Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, has not been a success, while 33 percent say it is a success.Doug Kaplan, managing partner of Gravis Marketing, which this week also conducted a North Carolina poll showing a statistical tie between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, tells Breitbart News, ""Trump could win both states.

After combining Chicago Board of Election voter histories and the Social Security Administration's death master file, they found more than one hundred instances of dead Chicagoans who apparently voted years after their verified deaths.One man who passed away in 1993 was found to have voted 11 times after his death.

Trump's pathway to the White House has significantly expanded in the past 24 hours with just ten days left until the election on Nov. 8, as federal law enforcement reopens a criminal investigation into his opponent's illicit email practices.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERDemocratic nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton again finds herself at the center of a criminal probe by the FBI as new devices surfaced in the federal grand jury case investigating former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-NY) led federal authorities to discover new as-of-yet-unseen evidence in the case. The emails, connected with Weiner's estranged wife and top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, wrap together a series of Democratic scandals into one mega-scandal on the eve of the election as millions of people nationwide continue early voting and just days before the general election on Nov. 8.The significant setback for Clinton, despite whatever her aides are spinning in the press, has halted her momentum and catapulted Trump back to the front of the pack in some polls and into contention in states that his campaign had previously considered too rough to handle. Momentum is significantly in Trump's corner, as in just four days--before the FBI revelations--he has seen a 10-point swing in the ABC News tracking poll. Jittery Democrats are now knifing each other with blind quotes to the media as Clinton's campaign struggles to maintain control of the race many media outlets already declared them the winner of, while Trump's campaign moves for the prize of 270 electoral votes.""We obviously respect the FBI's decision to reopen the investigation,"" Boris Epshteyn, a senior Trump adviser, told Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125. ""It means that their information was grave and serious enough for them to do so.""Trump campaign officials believed that before this bombshell in the closing days of the campaign, they had about 266 of the 270 electoral votes locked in when looking confidently at the map. All the red states--Alaska, Arizona, Utah, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia and Indiana--total up to 191 electoral votes. Only three of those have presented scares to the Trump campaign--Arizona, Utah, and Georgia--but Trump officials are generally confident they will have each of them locked up despite Clinton's bluff trip to Arizona this coming week. Add that 191 together with Florida's 29, North Carolina's 15, Nevada's 6, Iowa's 6, Ohio's 18 and Maine's second congressional district's 1 electoral vote, and Trump would have 266 electoral votes--putting him just one state shy of the win.Polls keep trending in Trump's direction in other battleground states like Pennsylvania, Colorado, and New Hampshire--while Trump's team aims to expand the map into other states like Michigan, Wisconsin, New Mexico, and even Minnesota. With those 266 in the bag, assuming they hold for Trump, there are any number of pathways for the businessman to the White House. New Hampshire's  four electoral votes, Pennsylvania's 20 electoral votes, Colorado's nine electoral votes, New Mexico's five electoral votes, Wisconsin's 10 electoral votes, Minnesota's 10 electoral votes, or Michigan's 16 electoral votes would each--independently, just one of those states by itself with the other 266 electoral votes--push Trump over the top. Even Virginia and its 13 electoral votes, which was once considered out of reach for Trump but has tightened in recent surveys, may now be back in play-and would also be enough to push Trump over the top. Trump has a shot in each of these places, and with Clinton slipping in the final push, that gives the Trump team cautious optimism everywhere.Epshteyn said:We have about three or four different pathways. Even if you look at the mainstream media, even MSNBC assumes we will get up to a baseline of 266 by winning Florida, winning Ohio, winning North Carolina. So we're at 266 then. Then we need four more to get to 270. Here's the options: win New Hampshire where we're within two or three points, win Colorado where we're within the margin of error, you could win Pennsylvania where we're within the margin of error... There are a lot of pathways to victory here. Virginia is tightening. Virginia is now within about 5 points. And then you've got these other states like Michigan, which is tightening largely because of Obamacare, Minnesota where the governor said Obamacare is no longer affordable--all within margins of error or a couple single digit points above that. There are a lot of pathways to victory here and the American people need to know that, that Donald Trump is going to win and he's got a lot of options for doing that.LISTEN TO BORIS EPSHTEYN FROM TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN ON BREITBART NEWS SATURDAYSpecifically, on Pennsylvania, Epshteyn noted that it's ""in play"" after Republicans haven't won it since 1988 because of ""the failures of the Clinton-Obama policies"" and because ""Donald Trump is such a revolutionary candidate who appeals to folks in Philadelphia as well as those folks in rural Pennsylvania who have been so disaffected and left behind by the Clinton economy.""""New Mexico is another state where we're going to be doing stops in New Mexico,"" Epshteyn added. ""Wisconsin is a state where Clinton just put money in Wisconsin because she's worried about it. The map is wide open for Republicans this time around and honestly not only are we going to win this thing, we have potential for a blowout in this election.""Iowa Republican Party chairman Jeff Kauffman said on Breitbart News Saturday that Hillary Clinton's attitude toward the election--she's been acting like she already won--has been turning voters across his state and around the country off.""There is a cockiness and an arrogance, and it's compounded by the fact they believe they're above the law,"" Kauffman said on the program. ""The most thunderous applause last night at the Trump rally [in Cedar Rapids] was when the comment was made that Hillary Clinton, you're not above the law. There is a real sense that they truly are privileged. You talk about the establishment? You look that up in Webster's dictionary and there's a picture of those two [the Clintons] right there. People are sick of this.""LISTEN TO IOWA GOP CHAIR JEFF KAUFFMAN ON BREITBART NEWS SATURDAYRep. Mike Kelly (R-PA), who also joined program, was up on Trump's chances in Pennsylvania, noting that union workers in western Pennsylvania are breaking towards Trump in traditionally Democratic areas. ""The road to the White House does go through Pennsylvania,"" Kelly said. ""I think we're going to see a change in Ohio--we're going to win Ohio. I think we can win Pennsylvania right now because those two areas I talked about--both Pittsburgh and Erie--those blue collar workers love Donald Trump because he represents a fair shot. He represents not shipping our jobs overseas.""LISTEN TO REP. MIKE KELLY ON BREITBART NEWS SATURDAY We have about three or four different pathways.

The Guardian reported the study too, describing people with 17 or more guns as ""gun super-owners"" who are often viewed as extreme. But GQ reports that ""owning 17 guns isn't that extreme"" and they stress that the key to understanding multiple gun ownership is to ""think of guns as tools."" When you think of guns in this way, it changes everything.GQ explains:[You have] a few different rifles for hunting different kinds of game, plus a shotgun, a handgun or two for self-protection, and some antique guns inherited from your grandfather.

If you're going hiking, you don't want to use that one pair of high heels.""The GQ article also contains a pertinent observation of the fact that firearm-related murders plummeted as private gun ownership began surging in America in the 1990s.GQ reports:After the school shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, pollsters asked if Americans thought gun crime was increasing or decreasing. 56% said gun crime had gone up over the past two decades. Only 12% knew the truth: gun murders had dropped by nearly 50% since the early 1990s. Over the same time period, Americans bought an estimated 70 million more guns.It should be noted that Americans bought far more than"" 70 million guns"" between the early 1990s and 2012. A 2012 Congressional Research Service report shows that private gun ownership jumped from 192 million firearms in 1994 to 310 million firearms in 2009; that is an increase of roughly 118 million firearms during that 15-year period alone.

The poll carries a  3.3 percent margin of error with a 95 percent level of confidence.The poll showed that in the presidential preference that former first lady Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, tied with her GOP rival Donald J. Trump at 46 percent, he said.In the Senate race to replace retiring Minority Leader Sen. Harry Reid, the Democrat's anointed successor Catherine Cortez Masto is ahead of GOP Rep. Joe Heck  with 50 percent of the vote to his 44 percent, he said.""Nevada is very hotly contested for both its six electoral votes and its open Senate seat,"" he said. In the 2012 presidential campaign, President Barack Obama won Nevada with 52 percent of the vote to 46 percent for his Republican challenger W. Mitt Romney.Kaplan said, ""It's a close race. In Nevada with a heavily Hispanic population lots of new voters ground game matters, which is a negative for Trump.""Democratic pollster Patrick Caddell told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview about the Nevada poll that Trump has an intensity advantage.""Because of her upper-income support, her voters tend to be more regular voters,"" he said. ""But, Trump voters tend to be much more interested-despite being self-reported as voting less often or regularly-that is an indication that he is going to have a stronger turnout than she is going to have.""It is a good sign for Trump that his voters are showing a higher interest in voting than her supporters, he said.When you put together the numbers for those voters taking the Trump positions on securing the border and refugee programs, not only is it a huge majority, but it includes a solid segment of Clinton's voters, too, he said.""If Trump can turn this into a referendum election on the issues, he wins,"" he said.Going head-to-head with Clinton based on personality or character is much more risky for him, he said.""Trump needs to elevate,"" said Caddell, who was the pollster advising three consecutive Democratic nominees in 1972, 1976, and 1980-along with a close second in 1984.""By elevating, I mean that Trump needs to lift the debate above the personality contest and make it about the issues-where the voters agree with him by large margins,"" he said.Caddell said voters in Nevada are tracking national polling in their negative view of the mainstream media.Respondents were asked:Regardless of whether you are for Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, or another candidate, which of the following is closest to your opinion? The behavior of the vast majority of the media in favor of Hillary Clinton and biased against Donald Trump, including not covering certain stories, is a threat to the people's right to know and to American democracy or Such conduct is normal and is not that important and not a threat to the people's right to know and to American democracy.Caddell said that the fact that 52 percent agreed that the media's coverage is threat to democracy, compared to 37 percent who dismissed it as normal and not a threat, speaks to the frustration voters are feeling: ""I think those are pretty compelling numbers.""Those numbers dovetail with the 50 percent of respondents who said the media favors Clinton, compared to the 8 percent who said the media favors Trump, he said.Asked about their concern about securing the southern border and immigration, 70 percent of the respondents said they were concerned-50 percent saying that they were very concerned.A number of questions in the poll dealt with voters' attitude about the state of affairs.Fifty-two percent of respondents said the country was going in the wrong direction, and 42 percent said the country was going in the right direction.In the same vein, 54 percent of poll participants said they want the next president to change the direction of the country and pursue new polices, and 42 percent said they want the next president to continue the policies of President Barack Obama.The poll was executed before news broke Friday that FBI Director James B. Comey Jr., wrote to congressional leaders to inform them that new emails have been discovered that are relevant to the investigation into Clinton's handling of sensitive electronic correspondence. Comey previously announced July 5 that he would recommend to the Department of Justice decline to prosecute Clinton.Respondents were asked: The FBI has concluded that Hillary Clinton potentially exposed top secret information to hostile countries when she used a private email server when she was Secretary of State but the agency has decided not to seek a criminal indictment of her. Which is closer to your view?  The FBI made the correct decision and she should not have been prosecuted. or The FBI made the wrong decision and she should have been prosecuted. Fifty percent of the respondents said it was the wrong decision, while 45 percent said it was the correct decision.An issue that becomes very contested in Nevada is not just the settling of refugees into the state, but also the concerns about the health of the refugees, especially the number of them carrying tuberculosis, which is being withheld from the public.Asked if they supported the president's plan to increase the number of refugees brought into the country from 85,000 to 110,000, 24 percent said they supported the increase, 18 percent said they wanted to stay at 85,000, 24 percent said they supported a reduction and 34 percent said they wanted the refugee program stopped. The reduction and stop position combined represents 59 percent of the voters.When they were asked if they agreed with the following statement: ""For years, the political elites have governed America for their own benefit-- and to the detriment of the American people. This election is the best chance in our lives to take back our government and change course,"" sixty-four percent said they agreed, broken down as 10 percent agreeing plus 54 percent agreeing strongly.Asked: ""Do you believe that Syrian refugees arriving in the United States have been subjected to the most rigorous security vetting, as the Obama Administration claims?"" fifty-two percent said they believed the administration's claims and 38 percent said they believed the claims.Virtually the strongest reaction to any question in the poll came in regards to Clinton's own plan for increasing the number of Syrian refugees. Only 26 percent said they supported an increase and 65 percent rejected an increase in Syrian refugees.The poll was conducted using interactive voice response polling with results weighted to match a proprietary turnout model.Thirty-nine percent of respondent were Democrats, 32 percent were Independents and 29 percent were Republicans.Regardless of whether you are for Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, or another candidate, which of the following is closest to your opinion? The behavior of the vast majority of the media in favor of Hillary Clinton and biased against Donald Trump, including not covering certain stories, is a threat to the people's right to know and to American democracy or Such conduct is normal and is not that important and not a threat to the people's right to know and to American democracy.The FBI has concluded that Hillary Clinton potentially exposed top secret information to hostile countries when she used a private email server when she was Secretary of State but the agency has decided not to seek a criminal indictment of her.
