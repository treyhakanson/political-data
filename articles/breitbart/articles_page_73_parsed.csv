KomenTostitosUnileverUnited WayVerizonWells FargoA list of companies that support third-party organizations that fund Planned Parenthood is located here.As Newsbusters notes, the liberal media that provide cover for Planned Parenthood will likely ignore -- or celebrate -- the corporate donors to the abortion business. The same media, nevertheless, are quick to publish the names of companies and individuals who support traditional marriage and refer to them as ""anti-gay.""Throughout the past year, Planned Parenthood has been defending itself against allegations that it sells the body parts of babies it aborts in its clinics for profit. The abortion business has been under congressional investigation since the release of undercover videos that exposed its alleged practice of harvesting the organs of aborted babies for sale.Though Planned Parenthood has denied any wrongdoing in its sale of body parts, the organization also released a statement in October of 2015 announcing it will no longer accept payments for aborted fetal tissue. The abortion business and its leftwing media supporters continue to insist the videos, produced by Center for Medical Progress, were ""deceptively edited.""However, a Democratic opposition research firm named Fusion -- hired by Planned Parenthood itself to review the videos -- said, while their analysts observed the videos had been edited -- as all videos are -- ""the analysis did not reveal widespread evidence of substantive video manipulation.""Additionally, Fusion noted, ""[A]nalysts found no evidence that CMP inserted dialogue not spoken by Planned Parenthood staff.""An analysis by Coalfire, a third-party forensics company hired by Alliance Defending Freedom, found that the videos were ""not manipulated"" and that they are ""authentic.""A recent Marist College Institute for Public Opinion poll found a full 81 percent of Americans favor some restrictions on abortion -- including limiting the procedure after the first three months -- and a continued ban on public funding of abortion.In the survey of 1,700 Americans, even 66 percent of respondents who identify themselves as pro-choice say, ""Abortion should be allowed, at most, in the first trimester, in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother, or never permitted.""According to 2ndVote's website, the organization describes itself as the ""conservative watchdog for corporate activism. Launched in 2013 after ""learning that March of Dimes donations were being funneled to Planned Parenthood,"" founder Dr. David Black continued his mission to investigate other leftwing groups that were being funded by consumer purchasing of products and donations.SIGN UPnd"	['Black']	['abortion']

Concerned about the difficulties of coordinating incoming requests from people attempting to assist with relief efforts that were being given to the State Department by the Clinton Foundation, Klevorick said, ""Most I can probably ID but not all.""In many of the newly-released exchanges, obtained by ABC News, Klevorick often wrote to Amitabh Desai, the Clinton Foundation's director of foreign policy.Further filtering offers from Clinton friends, Klevorick wrote, ""Is this a FOB!"" in response to a Clinton Foundation aide who had forwarded a woman's request to send medical supplies. ""If not, she should go to cidi.org,"" Klevorick wrote, advising that the woman, presumed not a Clinton friend, to go through a government website.Indeed, nearly a month after the relief efforts in Haiti were underway, they had been described in one diplomatic cable as a ""gold rush"" and a big opportunity for government contractors and aid groups.Hillary Clinton has spent the last 17 months dismissing allegations of pay to play corruption while she was Secretary of State, allegations first reported by Clinton Cash author and Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Peter Schweizer, calling them ""distractions and attacks.""However, the new emails provide further contradictions to Bill and Hillary Clinton's repeated claims that the Democratic nominee did not give special access and grant favors for Clinton allies and Clinton Foundation donors.""I think when you look at both the State Department and the Clinton Foundation in Haiti, that line was pretty faint between the two,"" Jake Johnston, a Haiti research analyst at the Center for Economic and Policy Research told ABC News. ""You had a lot of coordination and connection between the two, obviously. And I think that raises significant questions about how they were both operating.""Klevorick denies showing favoritism to friends of the Clintons during the Haiti recovery efforts.""Everyone's priority was to get the necessary resources to the right places as soon as possible to save lives,"" she said, according to ABC.""No special treatment was expected or given,"" Bruce Lindsey, the chairman of the board of the Clinton Foundation told ABC News.Still, the newly-released email exchanges paint a very different picture.In the frantic first few days of the calamitous earthquake, Desai wrote an email with the subject line ""Close friend of Clintons,"" saying ""This WJC VIP just called again from Jamaica to say Digicel is being pushed by US Army to get comms back up but is not being cleared by [the U.S. government] to deploy into Haiti to do so.""The correspondence was in reference to billionaire Denis O'Brien, a major Clinton Foundation donor and the CEO of the Haitian telecom firm Digital, and his efforts to fly employees of his company out of the devastated Caribbean island.In an attempt to push his request through faster, a frustrated O'Brien wrote an email to former top aide to Bill Clinton, Doug Band. ""We're finding it impossible to get landing slots,"" he says. ""I'm sorry to bother you but I am not making any progress through conventional channels.""Band, who helped create the Clinton Global Initiative, then writes to Desai asking him to ""pls get on this.""Band also reassures O'Brien, ""Never a bother.""Desai then reached out to Klevorick in assisting with helping ""a friend of President Clinton,"" and O'Brien's request is eventually brought before top USAID officials who were organizing the relief effort.Unapologetic, O'Brian told ABC News that he doesn't ""see any problem contacting anybody in the United States if I'm bringing in emergency aid where people are dying on the street because of lack of medical attention.""""I make no apologies for that,"" he added.ABC News also reports on another request for a Haiti relief contract made by a longtime Clinton ally:Desai forwarded a note to Klevorick from Garry Mauro, who served twice as the Texas state chairman for Bill Clinton's presidential campaigns and has donated $25,000 to $50,000 to the Clinton Foundation. The offer was for ""major assets in Haiti"" from a company called DRC Emergency Services. On its website, the company boasts of having performed emergency response work at disasters around the globe, with over $2 billion in disaster response contracts. Desai noted that Mauro was ""a friend of WJC.""Klevorick replied, ""also note hrc friend,"" using initials for Hillary Rodham Clinton. The email chain does not indicate if Mauro's recommendation led to a contract for DRC, though the company's website states, ""Within 24 hours of the earthquake's occurrence, DRC assembled and mobilized a team of highly experienced and dedicated personnel to Port-au-Prince and the surrounding areas.""Mauro told ABC News he approached the Clinton Foundation on behalf of DRC after seeing on television that former Presidents Clinton and George H.W. Bush were raising money for the disaster. DRC had already been doing temporary housing work in Haiti, and company officials thought the earthquake would open the door to a major business expansion.""They wanted to get some of the business,"" he said of DRC. ""The Clinton Foundation was a facilitator. They didn't have the money.""Mauro said he flew to New York and attended a meeting run by Bill Clinton at his Clinton Foundation offices, where contractors and aid groups with Haiti experience described their capabilities. Mauro said he was not aware that foundation officials sent emails to the State Department about his client, and he did not know if the company ultimately received a contract.An official with DRC said the company's Haiti relief work was overseen by supervisors who were no longer with the company, and he did not know which entity paid for the contract.Following the devastating earthquake in Haiti in 2010, at least one Clinton family member saw an opportunity to cash in on the multi-billion dollar recovery effort.Hillary Clinton's brother, Tony Rodham, landed a lucrative and historically rare Haitian ""gold exploitation permit"" allowing him to siphon massive profits from one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere.""I deal through the Clinton Foundation,"" Tony Rodham said according to a transcript of his testimony during court proceedings, obtained by The New York Times. ""That gets me in touch with the Haitian officials. I hound my brother-in-law [Bill Clinton], because it's his fund that we're going to get our money from. And he can't do it until the Haitian government does it.""The new email exchanges come nearly a week to the day after President Bill Clinton took to Twitter and urged his six million-plus followers to go to the embattled Clinton Foundation to assist in relief efforts for Haiti in the wake of the devastating destruction caused by Hurricane Matthew.""Praying for everyone impacted by #HurricaneMatthew. Here's how you can help in Haiti,"" Clinton said in his tweet, which linked to a Medium article, entitled, ""Members of the Clinton Foundation Community Respond to Hurricane Matthew; Ways to Support.""Haitians have spent years protesting Bill and Hillary Clinton, with one protester saying, ""The world should know about the crimes the Clinton family has committed against the country of Haiti-the money they have stolen from the earthquake victims. And we believe that were this to be anyone else, they'd be in jail right now.""Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudsonDesai forwarded a note to Klevorick from Garry Mauro, who served twice as the Texas state chairman for Bill Clinton's presidential campaigns and has donated $25,000 to $50,000 to the Clinton Foundation.

To further personalize her fight against the ruling allowing for super PACs to flourish, the Clinton camp produced a video for a dedicated page on her website to promote the position of getting ""unaccountable money out of our politics.""The Democrat nominee most recently brought the issue of needing to remove super PACs from the American electoral system in the second presidential debate against Donald Trump, according to The Wall Street Journal.Public positions against the use of super PAC organizations aside, recently-released emails and a campaign finance memo detail the lengths to which the campaign coordinated with Priorities USA with particular emphasis on sharing fundraising leads, joint donor relations efforts, and general communications. A memo penned by Clinton election counsel Marc Elias offered a scenario how a campaign staffer should properly share a donor lead to a super PAC fundraiser:Permissible: ""Donor A works in financial services and has been a long-time contributor. I think she'd be willing to do six figures for Priorities.""Not recommended: ""I want you to call Donor A and ask for $250,000.""The memo reminds Clinton staffers that if they are in a situation where they are raising funds on behalf of Priorities USA, ""they must include a hard money ask (for $5,000 or less) during the course of the conversation.""Clinton attorneys stressed that communications between the campaign and PAC be limited to conversations involving fundraising and avoid topics related to polling, messaging or other strategic issues.A separate email thread indicating a Google Calendar invitation between key Clinton staffers and legal counsel reflected a March 7, 2016 conference titled ""Super Pacs Check-In"". The invitation did not suggest any specific agenda items or whether ""Super Pacs"" referred to groups in addition to Priorities USA.Logan Churchwell is the Assistant Editor and a founding member of the Breitbart Texas team.

Always for the benefit of the slush fund known as the Clinton Foundation -- People like Paul Kagame, Riek Machar, Gilbert Chagoury, and General Paulino Matip Nhial,"" a narrator says in the one-minute Clinton Cash ad titled, ""Quid Pro Quo,"" obtained exclusively by Breitbart News.A pattern of behavior emerges,"" the narrator continues. ""The pattern begins with a poor country that's rich in natural resources. A country run by a tyrannical autocrat ready to do business... Bill is paid to give speeches. Hillary uses her powers to remove any obstacles. Contributions are paid to Clinton interests. As her power and influence grow, so does Hillary and Bill's bottom line.""This pattern of corruption, the ad explains, is how the Clintons went from being ""dead broke"" to ""overseeing an international organization worth billions.""The new Clinton Cash ad comes a week after comic book artist Brett R. Smith, the artistic mind behind Clinton Cash: A Graphic Novel, called the best-selling book -- fashioned for a millennial audience -- ""the most subversive foray into pop culture the right has ever attempted.""""More importantly, it has been successful,"" Smith said.

What an asshole.""He added in his email to bearak@nytimes.com, ""Missed you at the mini-reunion.""The email was apparently sent to Pulitzer Prize winning, New York Times correspondent Barry Bearak. Bearak was jailed in Zimbabwe in 2008 when he was in the country reporting on the elections there. He was charged with the crime of ""committing journalism,"" he wrote. The charges against him were later dismissed.The Democratic presidential campaign chair and Clinton confidant sent the email on August 1, 2015, right after the ""Cecil the Lion"" controversy began.Cecil the Lion became a household name on July 28 when reports hit that a Minnesota dentist had allegedly paid $50,000 plus to illegally kill the lion.As reported by Breitbart News and UPI, the Safari Operators Association and the Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force, confirmed that a Bloomington, Minnesota dentist by the name of Walter James Palmer, was identified as the popular lion's killer. Palmer allegedly paid for a private safari to hunt the 13-year-old lion. Zimbabwe wildlife officials said the group used food to lure Cecil out of the protected Hwange National Park. The lion was shot with an arrow but it took 40 hours to find him before they could finish him off with a gun. The lion was found decapitated and skinned. Oxford University's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit had been studying Cecil for years. The lion had been tagged and regularly seen by tourists on safari.The media and public backlash was swift. Hollywood celebrities took to social media to condemn Cecil's killers. As reported by Breitbart, Sharon Osbourne, the wife of Ozzy Osbourne tweeted that Palmer was a ""killer"" and called him ""Satan."" The wife of the heavy metal singer who once bit the head off a bat added, ""I don't know how anyone could go to this man for dental services after this."" Ricky Martin tweeted, ""#JusticeforCecilTheLion NOW."" Nancy Sinatra tweeted, ""Thanks for caring about #CecilTheLion, Jimmy. Maybe that creep should be skinned - slowly - for 40 hours. @jimmykimmel."" Mia Farrow tweeted the home address of the dentist, and when asked about the lion's killer, Betty White said, ""Do you really want to know? Anything loose cut off.""""I deeply regret that my pursuit of an activity I love and practice responsibly and legally resulted in the taking of this lion,"" Palmer told the public in a statement.

Sullivan, who then served as Director of Policy Planning at Clinton's State Department, had forwarded a message from Clinton Advisor Daniel Kurtz-Phelan. The subject line of the unclassified message was ""American guns killing American agents.""The email from Kurtz-Phelan to Sullivan said ""FYI, ATF announced last night that the gun used to kill the ICE agent in Mexico last month was purchased in the Dallas- area, by U.S.-based straw buyers. If this isn't on the Secretary's radar, it might be worth flagging it for her."" The email went on with a block quote of an Associated Press article titled, ""ATF: Gun in US Agent's Death Traced to Texas Man."" Secretary Clinton's sole response to the email was to ask about the media ramifications of this revelation.ICE Agent Victor Avila was also wounded in the attack. Secretary Clinton did not inquire about the then current condition or status of Agent Avila or about Agent Zapata's family. She only inquired about press coverage of the report.In February 2012, Breitbart News' AWR Hawkins reported on the connection between the gun used to kill Agent Zapata and the Fast and Furious federal gun running program. He wrote:Congressman Darrell Issa (R-CA) is looking into the DOJ's role in Agent Zapata's murder, and believes the weapon which was used came from a program similar to Fast and Furious. Which means that no one knows whether the gun-walking tied to Fast and Furious was ended, as Holder said it was, only to be started again under another program (with another name), or whether the gun walking tied to Fast and Furious simply continued longer than Holder claims it did. And this brings the focus back to the head of the DOJ's criminal division, Lanny Breuer, ""who suggested letting some illicit 'straw' weapons buyers in the U.S. [to] transport their guns across the border into Mexico where they could be arrested."" Was Breuer's suggestion adopted for Fast and Furious or was it adopted for another program that supplied the weapon with which Agent Zapata was killed?Congressman Issa appeared on Fox News on February 28, 2012, and said the DOJ was continuing to refuse to cooperate with the investigation by the House Oversight Committee.  ""I have told the Attorney General that it is contemptible, and I will seek, if necessary, contempt of the House, if we can't get cooperation under the constitution in our investigation,"" Issa said.Hawkins connected this murder with the murder of Border Patrol Agent Terry. Agent Terry was murdered just two months before the attack on Zapata and a gun connected to the Fast and Furious scandal was found at the scene.Breitbart's Mary Chastain wrote in October 2012 about an interview of Agent Avila's sister, Magdalena Avila-Villalobos by Univision. She presented the following as Agent Avila's own words about the attack:Agent Zapata and Agent Avila met with American consulate agents in Monterrey and received 14 boxes of equipment. They did stop for something to eat on road 57 before heading back to Mexico City. About a half hour after leaving the restaurant they noticed two cars closely following them.  Within seconds the vehicles surrounded them and 14 heavily armed men formed a circle around their car.Unfortunately, Agent Zapata put the car in park, which forced the doors to automatically open. Agent Avila said they thought their diplomatic plates would protect them and the screamed they were American agents. The men didn't care and demanded them to exit the vehicle.The agents refused to leave their vehicle. They frantically tried to relock the doors, but instead Agent Avila accidentally lowered his window. A rifle and handgun came in through the small opening and the man opened fire. Agent Avila pressed the emergency satellite button, but it did not work. He also tried to place an emergency call to the embassy, the Mexican capital, and the First Post of the Regional Security Command. They told Avila a Mexican Federal Police helicopter would be there in 40 minutes.90 bullets were fired. Five hit Agent Zapata and three hit Agent Avila in his right leg. Agent Zapata turned to Agent Avila and said, ""I am going to die."" Agent Avila responded, ""No, you are not going to die. Be strong, help is on the way, you are not going to die.While in the rescue helicopter Agent Avila was informed Agent Zapata did, in fact, die.In May 2016, Breitbart Texas' Legal Analyst Lana Shadwick wrote about the men facing trial for Zapata's murder and Avila's injuries:Twenty-eight-year-old Jesus Ivan Quezada Pina who goes by the alias ""Loco,"" and thirty-three-year-old Alfredo Gaston Mendoza Hernandez (a.k.a.

I finally had to get her in person,"" Clinton Campaign Communication Director Jennifer Palmieri replies to Leibovich, implying that she had to wait to talk to Hillary about what parts of the interview they would allow being used. ""Fine to use the moose, but appreciate leaving the mention of Sarah Palin out.""During the portion of the interview about the ""moose"" Hillary talks about having eaten ""moose stew"" and says of Palin, ""So that's why I always got a big kick out of Sarah Palin with all of her, ""We're cooking up some moose stew here."" (Laughter.)"" The conversation then goes into what's more dangerous a ""mother grizzly"" or a ""mother moose.""The email exchange (Wikileaks Podesta Email 4213) between Palmieri and New York Times writer Mark Leibovich was forwarded to John Podesta by Palmieri in July 2015. Leibovich sends a transcript from the portions of his interview with Hillary that he would like to use saying, ""I wanted option to use the following (obviously wouldn't use all, but a portion) *These exchanges were pretty interesting.....would love the option to use....*""Leibovich categorizes the portions of the interview he requests to use under sections titled, ""*Moose* , THE BLIND DATE, MENTAL HEALTH, FEELING BETTER PREPARED, *""RELATING""*, and *""NORMAL PERSON""*."" Besides granting Leibovich permission to use ""the moose"" with the condition of leaving out mention of Palin, the campaign gives him permission to use two other sections but again with conditions.Palmieri explains, ""From last two questions, fine to use everything from the paragraph starting, 'and to get serious for just a minute...' till the end of the interview as on the record -- with the exception of this passage which I ask you leave out: 'and gay rights has moved much faster than women's rights or civil rights, which is an interesting phenomenon somebody in the future will unpack.'""Leibovich opens his article using his sighting of a moose as a ""point of connection"" with Hillary. As instructed he conceals Clinton's mention of Palin and all other portions of the interview the campaign vetoed.Despite allowing the Clinton campaign the ability to veto any interview content, in his article, Leibovich brags that even after the campaign sent him an email in the leadup to his story instructing him that the campaign office was ""OTR"" or off-the-record, he responded by writing that he ""wasn't abiding by any 'office is off the record provisions.'""After dishing out the marching orders, Palmieri finishes by telling Leibovich, ""Pleasure doing business.""Dustin Stockton is a political reporter for Breitbart News, a community liaison for Gun Owners of America, and a political strategist.

Her personal story serves as the basis for the rape accusations against Clinton.Stated Broaddrick of the movement: ""Well I hope that no one gets hurt during this. But I hope it encourages people to say why are they saying this? What does Bill Clinton have to do with rape? And then hopefully they will research and find out.""Watch the video segment with Broaddrick here.Broaddrick was being filmed for an extensive interview with this reporter in the presidential suite of the Watergate Hotel in Washington, D.C. Also on video were Kathleen Willey, the White House aide who accused Bill Clinton of sexually assaulting her in the Oval Office, and Paula Jones, who famously accused Clinton of sexually assaulting her in a hotel room.On Tuesday, Hillary Clinton was interrupted at a Miami campaign stop by a protester who shouted ""Bill Clinton is a rapist."" Clinton ignored the protester, who was reportedly escorted from the event.At a campaign rally in Detroit on Monday, Clinton was similarly interrupted by a protester wearing a t-shirt claiming that her husband is a rapist. The man was reportedly booed and pushed by Clinton supporters.""You know, I do hope someone follows that gentleman out and stages an intervention. He clearly has not been following this election very closely,"" Clinton told the audience.There appears to be a growing movement of protesters interrupting Clinton campaign events with charges against her husband.At a rally last week, Bill Clinton himself was confronted with a protester brandishing a ""Bill Clinton is a Rapist"" placard.Clinton commented, ""I love it when people come to my rallies. And it's a dead giveaway when they don't want to have a conversation because they know they'll lose the conversation.""Earlier this month, a protester interrupted a Fox News outdoor live shot by repeatedly yelling ""Bill Clinton is a rapist"" at the camera. Security guards removed the protester from the scene.On Sunday, Breitbart News released an exclusive video interview in which Broaddrick recounted what she described as the life-changing experience of being raped by Clinton. The YouTube video has since garnered over one million views.Trembling, Broaddrick explained that she is still afraid of Bill Clinton and asserted that she is frightened by the prospect of Hillary Clinton winning the election. She described the alleged rape in vivid detail, providing the most extensive window yet into the singular event that she says left her traumatized until today.In one dramatic scene, a sobbing Broaddrick was embraced and consoled by another alleged Clinton sexual assault victim, Kathleen Willey, who was present for the filming.Willey tells the crying Broaddrick: ""It's not your fault. Okay. It's not your fault. It's not your fault. You didn't do anything wrong. You didn't do anything wrong. Okay.

""In a lot of ways, DOMA was a line that was drawn that was to prevent going further.""That message rang hollow to liberal LGBT activists, who called the Clintons out on the talking point.Hillary's rival Bernie Sanders also took up the fight.""Today, some are trying to rewrite history by saying that they voted for one antigay law to stop something worse,"" Sanders said pointedly during his speech at the Jefferson-Jackson dinner in Iowa. ""That's not the case.""The Huffington Post's Sam Stein and Jennifer Bendery tackled the issue in detail, sending alarm bells off in the campaign.Richard Socarides, Bill Clinton's former aide on gay rights issues and a current Democratic strategist, worked with Podesta to stem the damage.He sent the following advice:Best if she says something to a reporter herself. She could call Chris Geidner at BuzzFeed. I know that's hard.Second best is put out a statement on paper. Either from her or you or Jen. I could help write it.Third option, possible for somebody to call a reporter on her behalf. Call someone with whom we have a relationship and explain, or I could call and try to explain it but this is definitely not as good as the first two, at least by itself.In another email chain, the Clinton campaign squabbled back and forth for the best reaction to the controversy apparently before the Huffington Post article was published.""There is, IMO, deep discontent out there stemming from what she said on Friday,"" Dominic Lowell, the LGBT Outreach Director for Clinton's campaign warned.Some aides supported the idea of walking back Clinton's comments; others didn't.""Keep in mind: the story will suck regardless,"" wrote Clinton spokesperson Brian Fallon. ""But I would just say we should use it as the vehicle for giving a statement that reads as a walkback, even as HRC will never approve a true walkback.""Fallon advised against Clinton herself making a statement, but admitted that the campaign needed to do something to ""quell the LGBT backlash.""By circulating the Huffington Post story, he argued, ""our LGBT friends"" could see that they successfully humbled the campaign enough to walk it back.""We are blowing this people. Chains of 40 emails aren't helping,"" a frustrated Podesta replied.Eventually, Fallon drafted the following statement that was used by the Huffington Post in their article.Whatever the context that led to the passage of DOMA nearly two decades ago, Hillary Clinton believes the law was discriminatory and both she and President Clinton urged that it be overturned. As President, Hillary Clinton will continue to fight to secure full and equal rights for LGBT Americans who, despite all our progress, can still get married on a Saturday and fired on a Monday just because of who they are and who they love.The article also included a quote from Socarides:""(T)here is no question that President Clinton believed that one of the reasons he was willing to sign a bill that he did not like was because he thought he would prevent greater damage.""SIGN UP"	['Sanders', 'Clinton']	['gay']

The October SurpriseRemember the ""October Surprise""? I sure do. Back in the 1980 presidential campaign, the October Surprise was the rumor that the incumbent president, Jimmy Carter, vexed as he was by the Iranian hostage crisis, would pull off some shocking ploy--such as gaining the sudden release of the hostages--as a way of winning that year's November election. That October Surprise never happened, of course, and maybe we'll never really know if it was ever anything more than a figment of someone's imagination.And yet as we all do know, in that year, 1980, it was Ronald Reagan, not Carter, who triumphed. In fact, Reagan won in a landslide. Still, the notion of some big game-changer happening in October has reverberated in every presidential election since.This year, 2016, October has only just begun, and so we don't yet know what shockeroo might be in store for us. Yet it's a cinch that something surprising will happen, because, well, that's the way the world works. Indeed, just on Monday morning, we got an ominous indicator of what could be in the offing; the Iranians fired two missiles at a U.S. ship off the coast of Yemen in the Middle East. (The missiles missed, and there were no American casualties).Of course, we already know that on October 4, to the surprise of the pundits Mike Pence clearly won his vice presidential debate against Tim Kaine. Yes, as we all saw, Pence was calm and cool, while Kaine was overcaffeinated and overheated.  And we also know that in the second presidential debate on October 10, Donald Trump put the hammer down on Hillary Clinton--""You should be ashamed of yourself; you should be in jail."" It's fair to say that the political class didn't see either of those events coming; those two victories in the debates were, yes, October surprises.Looking ahead a month to Election Day, November 8, one hesitates to make any sort of prediction; after all, the news cycle--in reality, a continuous news stream--is so fast and furious now that who can say what impressions the voters will have in their heads as they go to the polls. So instead, one must settle for piecing together clues and portents. And I will say this: The  parallels between 1980 and 2016 are strong. Indeed, I have particularly sharp recollections of the 1980 presidential election, because I was there: I was a twenty-something peon in the policy operation at the Reagan headquarters, first known as Reagan for President in Los Angeles, and later, in Arlington, VA, as the Reagan-Bush campaign.To be sure, my duties were humble; mostly, I answered letters and helped fill out questionnaires, along with making frequent runs to the library--because that's what you had to do back then to check facts in the pre-Internet era. (One of my missions was a trip to the Library of Congress to gather material on the legal power of the president to unilaterally impose wage-and-price controls: Yes, the theory that Carter would suddenly announce a drastic governmental response to the double-digit inflation of that era was yet another rumored ""October Surprise."")2. ""Change"" vs. ""More of the Same.""We might consider: In that long-ago national contest, the two main choices were Democrat Jimmy Carter and Republican Ronald Reagan. And as in all elections, the big question was whether the voters wanted ""change,"" or ""more of the same.""In elections, as we know, sometimes ""change"" wins, sometimes ""more of the same"" wins--that's up to the voters. In that long-ago year, of course, ""change"" emerged triumphant--although, as we shall see, it was touch-and-go almost right up till Election Day.Carter, of course, was in the White House, and so he had the advantage of incumbency.  That is, he had the national megaphone, as well as all the trappings of presidential prestige. Yet Carter also had the disadvantage of incumbency. That is, he had a record to defend, and it wasn't pretty.Still, at the beginning of the year, 1980, according to Gallup, Reagan was down by as much as 30 points. Indeed, the Gipper didn't pull ahead until late October--and then he really surged, winning on November 4 by almost ten points, carrying 44 states.So now to today: Hillary Clinton is the incumbent, and her record also isn't pretty.  Okay, strictly speaking, she isn't the incumbent, but she might as well be; she's an alumna of the Obama administration, and she has all of its top officials actively helping her, including the President, the First Lady, and the Vice President. Indeed, Barack Obama has said that he will consider it to be a personal insult to him if Trump wins.In addition, of course, Hillary suffers from the accumulated weight of the Clinton presidency; indeed, the 42nd president himself has never left the national stage. And while in the minds of some, Bill Clinton's presence is an asset, that was before he called Obamacare ""the craziest thing in the world,"" and before the Trump campaign brought some of his past sexual victims to St. Louis for a pre-debate panel discussion.To be sure, the MSM did its best to ignore Clinton victims--in keeping with its see-no-evil approach of the last quarter-century. Yet the Trump campaign was able to bypass the MSM filter by ""broadcasting"" the poignant event, along with interviews, through the new online media.  So we can see: Only now is Bill Clinton getting the payback he has always deserved. And to the extent that Hillary was, and is, his enabler and co-conspirator, she, too, is getting her just desserts.In the meantime, down below the commanding heights, out there in Flyover Country, everyone knows about the stagnating economy, as well as the foreign policy challenges and debacles that worsened during Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. Moreover, there's the recent spike in terrorism and violence in New York, Charlotte, Dallas, Baton Rouge--and, of course, the steady flow of blood gushing in just about every big city.So it's little wonder that a CBS News poll from mid-September found that 55 percent of Americans want ""big changes,"" while 43 percent want ""some changes""; just two percent think things are fine the way they are. We need hardly add the  observation: If 98 percent of the voters are favoring ""change,"" it will be hard for this not to be a ""change"" election.Then the CBS poll asked: Which candidate can be trusted to change Washington? The answer: 47 percent trust Trump to do it, 20 percent trust Clinton to do it.  In other words, Trump owns the ""change"" issue by a whopping 27-point margin. In a ""change"" year, that's the stuff of landslides--as was 1980.So today, when I see the polls showing Trump behind, I just smile: If the voters mean it when they say that they want change, well, then, they will get change--whether or not the pollsters can see it coming.Meanwhile, the larger context of the times back then argued strongly for change--drastic change. At home, we were suffering from severe inflation and rising unemployment. At the same time, abroad, the Carter administration suffered the daily indignity of the Iranian hostage crisis.  And elsewhere, Carter haplessly confronted the strategic challenges of the Soviet-aided communist victory in Nicaragua and the Russians' outright invasion of Afghanistan.So it was little wonder that, according to a Gallup poll, satisfaction with the condition of the country hit a rock-bottom 12 percent in the summer of 1979, and it stayed down in the teens all through 1980.Yet for all that dissatisfaction, for almost the whole of 1980, it was no certainty that the voters would choose Reagan over Carter. After all, much like Trump today, Reagan was loathed by the media, and that depressed his numbers--or so we thought.3. The Media vs. Republicans: The Song Remains the SameMoreover, back then, there was no alternative media, and so what we now think of as the Main Stream Media was just...the media. You know, as in the broadcast networks, The New York Times, and The Los Angeles Times. These outlets might not seem that important today--it's perfectly possible to get all the news one wants without ever visiting a legacy site, and the LA Times is one of many newspapers to have gone through bankruptcy--and yet in those days, the longstanding media outlets were seemingly all-powerful.So on every morning at Reagan campaign HQ, top people had already read a hard-copy version of The New York Times or The Washington Post; a little later, the same people would receive the clips--a thick batch of photocopies of news articles mailed or faxed from around the country. And at 6:30 pm, and again at 7 pm, everything would stop, because we all had to see how the campaign was playing on the nightly newscasts, which in those days were watched by most of the country.Of course, we usually gritted our teeth as we watched, because the TV reporters, like the print reporters, despised Reagan; almost all of them regarded him as a crazy, maybe even senile, cowboy who would get us not only into a depression, but also into World War Three. (Carter, in their mind, was a well-intentioned failure; that was hardly a ringing endorsement, to be sure, but in the journalistic mind, Carter's weakness paled compared to Reagan's menace.)So with Reagan being savaged every morning and every evening, it wasn't surprising that our polling was dismal.  A Gallup Poll from early January, for example, showed Carter leading Reagan by a nearly two-to-one margin, 62 percent to 33 percent.That was the paradox: The American people knew that things were going badly, but the media kept insisting that there was no alternative other than to vote for Carter.4. Third Parties, and Fourth PartiesYet then an alternative that the media deemed to be plausible did emerge. That was Rep. John B. Anderson (R-IL). Anderson had run a quixotic campaign in the '80 GOP primaries as a tax-increasing, arms-controlling liberal. He didn't win a single Republican primary, and yet the media fell in love with him, loving him all the more when he devoted himself entirely to bashing Reagan and the GOP.And so, riding that wave of media enthusiasm, Anderson abandoned the Republicans and opted for an independent run for the White House. In fact, mindful of his new political base, he positioned himself to the left of not only Reagan, but also of Carter. And for a while, it was working for him; according to Gallup, he reached 24 percent in June.Yet once the media realized that Anderson, by now a leftist, was drawing more votes away from Carter than from Reagan, most reporters turned against him. And so then, deprived of his media halo, he slid down to less than seven percent on Election Day.Looking back at the Anderson boomlet, we can see what was happening in the electorate: Many Republicans, or Republican-leaning independents, were leery of voting for Reagan, and so they ""parked"" themselves with Anderson as they evaluated the two major-party candidates more closely. And then, in the end, a lot of them did vote for Reagan.So in a way, the Anderson surge in '80 was a precursor of what we're seeing this year.  In 2016, the role of Anderson is being played, in effect, by two other liberal Republicans, former governor Gary Johnson of New Mexico and former governor Bill Weld of Massachusetts. Strictly speaking, Johnson and Weld are the Libertarian Party's presidential and vice-presidential nominees, but they have scored well--as high as 12 percent in some polls--because they have served as a ""safe haven"" for many Republicans who dislike Trump and yet can't bring themselves to support Hillary.Weld, in particular, cuts a distinctly John Anderson-type profile; that is, he is a Republican deeply opposed to the dominant conservative faction. And as  for Johnson, he himself was mostly a conservative when holding office in the 90s; and yet since then, he has chosen to focus his post-gubernatorial career, as well as his '16 campaign, on the legalization and mass-marketing of marijuana. Thus in the context of today, both Weld and Johnson are firmly on the John Anderson-type left.Indeed, as with Anderson in 1980, that's probably why the Libertarian ticket is suddenly receiving so much criticism; the MSM has figured out that these third-partiers are draining more votes from the Democrat than the Republican. Can't have that! And since Anderson then, and Johnson today, have been mostly media creations, it's little surprise that as their media support ebbs, so, too, does their political support.5. Four More Years?  Really??Meanwhile, back in 1980, the big issue was the condition of the country. On July 17, in his acceptance speech to the Republican national convention in Detroit, Reagan finally had his opportunity to speak to the bulk of the American electorate, unfiltered by the media. And in the course of making his overall case for change, he deftly jabbed at Carter:Can anyone look at the record of this administration and say, ""Well done?"" Can anyone compare the state of our economy when the Carter Administration took office with where we are today and say, ""Keep up the good work?"" Can anyone look at our reduced standing in the world today and say, ""Let's have four more years of this?""Thus with the whole country watching, Reagan framed the key issue: Carter equaled ""more of the same""; Reagan equaled ""change.""For his part, Carter had no new ideas for the future; he was truly the more-of-the-same candidate.  In addition, he didn't have much of a record to run on, and he knew that, too.  So his plan, instead, was to demolish Reagan--just as Hillary today is attempting to demolish Trump.  In his August 14, 1980 acceptance speech to the Democratic national convention in New York, Carter ripped into his challenger and all Republicans:In their fantasy America, all problems have simple solutions--simple and wrong.  It's a make-believe world, a world of good guys and bad guys, where some politicians shoot first and ask questions later.  No hard choices, no sacrifice, no tough decisions--it sounds too good to be true, and it is.For a while, this strategy of ripping up Reagan appeared to be working. Gallup records that in early August, Carter was ahead of Reagan by sixteen points, 45:29. For purposes of comparison, we can note that on August 9 of this year, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average, Clinton was ten points ahead of Trump.Yet back in 1980, for all the reasons noted, the country wanted change. And so by mid-August, Reagan had pulled to within a single point of Carter, and the two candidates stayed neck-and-neck all through September.So if we might skip ahead 36 years, that's almost exactly where we are today: According to the RealClearPolitics average, as of October 10, Clinton is 4.5 points ahead of Trump in the four-way race. So we might recall: Clinton is almost exactly where Carter was at this time, 36 years ago.6.  When Democrats AttackMeanwhile, back in 1980, Carter chose to intensify his fusillade against Reagan: On October 6, he declared that a Reagan victory would fracture the country; speaking in Michigan, he told the voters,You'll determine whether or not this America will be unified, or if I lose this election whether America might be separated--black from white, Jew from Christian, North from South, rural from urban.Here we might pause to observe that it might seem, well, unseemly for the incumbent to do nothing but attack the challenger. And yet that was what Carter chose to do; he obviously had no confidence in the political viability of his own record. And in fact, for a while, Carter's attack-attack-attack plan seemed to be working; by mid-October, the Georgian had pulled ahead-- according to Gallup, he was now up by five points.Then, on October 28, came the lone Carter-Reagan debate. To read the transcript, one might think that Carter performed well. Here's a typical passage, from the well-briefed and highly detail-oriented Carter:We now are planning to continue the revitalization program with increased commitments of rapid transit, mass transit.  Under the windfall profits tax, we expect to spend about $43 billion in the next 10 years to rebuild the transportation systems of our country. We also are pursuing housing programs.  We've had a 73 percent increase in the allotment of Federal funds for improved education.  These are the kinds of efforts worked on a joint basis with community leaders, particularly in the minority areas of the central cities that have been deteriorating so rapidly in the past.Note not only the farrago of statistics, but also the systematic base-touching:  ""mass transit,"" ""housing programs,"" ""improved education,"" ""community leaders, particularly in the minority areas of the central cities."" (Carter didn't stop to explain why it was that those minority areas were ""deteriorating so rapidly"" during his presidency--in the same way that Hillary today doesn't acknowledge the recent worsening of urban conditions under the policies that she not only favors, but wishes to accelerate.)For his part, in the same debate, Reagan made an entirely different sort of argument. He wasn't interested in piling up data points; instead, he was interested in changing the country:I believe the Presidency is what Teddy Roosevelt said it was. It's a bully pulpit. And I think that something can be done from there, because a goal for all of us should be that one day, things will be done neither because of nor in spite of any of the differences between us--ethnic differences or racial differences, whatever they may be--that we will have total equal opportunity for all people.  And I would do everything I could in my power to bring that about.Yet Carter had his nuke-Reagan plan all laid out, and he kept at it throughout the debate. The 39th president relentlessly zeroed in on perceived Reagan weaknesses, hoping to catch the Republican in some nitpicky error. And that's when Reagan responded with his famous retort, ""There you go again."" With those four words, combining humor and dismissiveness, Reagan stamped Carter as what he was--a small-minded factoid-monger filling out the remaining days of his failed presidency.Later that night, Democratic spin doctors--in and out of the media--didn't want to admit it, but everyone knew that Reagan had won the debate. Yes, Carter had spewed out his almanac of trivia, but even he couldn't make his record in the White House look good.In other words, Reagan had gone toe-to-toe with the President of the United States and emerged not only as a plausible commander-in-chief, but also as, definitely, the more likable man. And so that's when the dynamic of a ""change"" election really kicked in: The dam broke, as voters who had been reluctant to commit now sluiced into Reagan's reservoir.The last Gallup poll of the 1980 campaign showed Reagan up three points, 47:44; although as noted earlier, he ended up winning by ten points. To put that another way, although Gallup called the election correctly, it was still off by seven points--and that's something to keep in mind as the 2016 election nears.Meanwhile, according to the current-day reminiscences of Marc Rotterman, a fellow Reagan campaigner that year, ""Back in 1980, we had a president who had a complete disconnect from the country.""  Rotterman recently gave this pithy encapsulation of Carter:He had no understanding of what it would take to move the country forward.  Most Americans thought that their personal situation would get worse with another four years of Carter--and so they voted for our guy.Then Rotterman, who lives in Raleigh, North Carolina, and has carved out a long career in Republican political consulting, mostly in the Tarheel State, added a direct warning to Democrats about the current rioting in Charlotte, underscoring the importance of the ""change"" theme: ""Law and order is going to be a key component of this election, and that spells trouble for Clinton and the Democrats."" To put that another way: Will the Democrats be the party of ""more of the same"" when it comes to disorder and terror? If so, that looks like a political loser.7. The ChoiceIndeed, we can all step back and ask: This November, will the country vote to renew its commitment to the sort of laxity that enables foreign terrorists to enter the country, even as others take to the streets to loot and burn? If the voters do reward chaos, it will contradict all historical precedent.That's the challenge to Hillary: Like Carter before her, she knows better than to run on overt ""four more years"" agenda, and so, instead, she figures that she must knock Trump out of the box with negative attacks--and coordinate her barrage, of course, with the MSM.And in defense of her tactics, we might ask: What else can she do? She is trying, of course, to run on the Obama record--offering her presidency, in effect, as his third term. But does that really seem like a winning message?However, she can't run on her record, because, as Trump says to great effect, her 30 years in public life about to ""all talk, no action.""And she can't run on Bill Clinton's record for many reasons, starting with the fact the trade deals he championed are now in disrepute, and ending, as we have seen, with the sudden re-emergence of his own past sexual indiscretions--and have we mentioned the Clinton Foundation?Finally, she can't run on the Democratic platform published in Philadelphia; that was the most left-wing major-party platform in history--does she really want to get into a discussion of open borders in a time such as this?No, not a one of those options are attractive for her. Thus she is left with just one last option--attack.Happily for Hillary's mindset, the first-strike-on-Trump plan fits with her own personal needs; she seems to have worked up a strong personal hatred for the New Yorker. In fact, as we all know, Hillary has extended her contempt for Trump to contempt for his supporters--all those ""deplorables.""Indeed, her fast-multiplying hatreds seems to have, well, made her a bit crazy, or at least crazed-looking.  On September 21, The Drudge Report linked to a Washington Post story on a Hillary campaign video with the headline, ""Manic.""  Yes, manic is a good word to describe her demeanor in that video. And that particular story, by the way, was headlined, ""Clinton asks why she isn't beating Trump by 50 points.""  Yes, she really said it: ""Why aren't I 50 points ahead?"" In other words, Hillary is visibly exasperated at the thought of having a close contest with Trump; this hasn't been the cakewalk that her advisers promised her. (We might also recall that an earlier set of advisers had promised her a cakewalk in 2008.)Yet we might pause to note that the largest presidential landslide in American history, in 1920, was 26 points, or barely more than half of the victory margin that Hillary has been hoping for.And so we're left to contemplate, with mind-boggled awe, Hillary's soaring sense of entitlement. It's one thing that she would think that she deserves to win by 50 points; it's quite another to say it out loud in an official campaign video. Thus we all can gain a clue about the nature of the cocoon in which she has been living--it's a cocoon with thick walls. And we can surmise: No wonder she didn't think that U.S. government rules about e-mail, or foundation ethics, or Benghazi truth-telling, applied to her.So now our comparison of 1980 and 2016 must end--we have to let the election play out. Quite possibly, just as was the lone Carter-Reagan presidential debate in '80, the next Clinton-Trump debate, to be held on October 19, will be decisive. Yes, Trump is behind, but as we have seen, in a ""change"" year, if the challenger can make himself seem acceptable to undecided voters, then the tide of change will sweep him into the White House.And we also know this: Since Hillary can't run on her record, can't run on her vision for the future, and certainly can't run on her own personal probity, then, like Carter before her, she has only one choice: Attack. That's what she did Sunday night in St. Louis, that's what all her campaign surrogates are doing and will be doing, and, of course, that's what the MSM is and will be doing.Yes, it's a big gamble for Clinton. Despite her best efforts to tear him down--and in spite of some self-inflicted wounds--Trump is still standing. That is, it's not so clear that her billions of dollars' worth of anti-Trump messaging is having the desired effect. But then, as we have seen, there's nothing else she can do.  So it's double-down time: attack, attack, attack.So it's fitting that the October 19 debate will be held in Las Vegas. Hillary may seem like the front runner, but the winds of change are blowing against her, hard. So she will need all the luck she can get, because even if the Clinton campaign has become utterly predictable, the voters are rarely predictable--they can always pull a November Surprise.Can anyone look at the record of this administration and say, ""Well done?"" Can anyone compare the state of our economy when the Carter Administration took office with where we are today and say, ""Keep up the good work?"" Can anyone look at our reduced standing in the world today and say, ""Let's have four more years of this?""In their fantasy America, all problems have simple solutions--simple and wrong.

Thanks to all for the feedback. This is indeed a hard balance to strike, since we don't want to invite mockery for being too enthusiastically opposed to a deal she once championed, or over-claiming how bad it is, since it's a very close call on the merits. Below and attached is a revised draft:
Statement on TPP
As Secretary of State, I called for a strong, fair, and balanced trans-Pacific trade agreement as part of a broader strategy to reassert American leadership in Asia and a robust economic agenda at home to strengthen our ability to compete successfully with anyone in the world. I salute President Obama and his team for working incredibly hard in pursuit of that kind of deal.

I had to pass a battery of tests to get to the point where, in the U.S. Air Force, I was allowed to protect our nuclear arsenal. I then went on to become a Secret Service uniformed division officer for 12 years, where I had to take a polygraph test. In eight out of those twelve years, I protected the Clintons, and the Hillary Clinton I know is a complete pathological liar,"" he said.""Really, if you're honest with yourself and you pay attention to some of the politics that goes on, you've seen this yourself,"" said Byrne. ""She never displays any kind of leadership. I cite many examples in my book where she gets so angry, she has the people that work for her, they're terrified of her.""He recounted a story from Crisis of Character about ""these three women who came up from Arkansas with her. They knew the Clintons.

""They really looked like they were afraid of something. I thought something was wrong, somebody was sick. And they explained to me what happened, that they had inadvertently allowed an intern to order some stationery, and the girl had made a mistake, so they had tens of thousands of copies of these invitations to the White House that were worth a lot of money, that were useless. And they weren't worried about the wasted taxpayer dollars. They were worried about who was gonna tell Hillary Clinton because they knew somebody was getting fired and sent back to Arkansas.""""That's just one example of her incredible anger toward people,"" said Byrne.

So her staff member comes over, and tells me what they're gonna do, and she says, 'When we're done, we'll be leaving them here, and Mrs. Clinton and I will be leaving and going to do something else.'""""I said, 'Someone else is going to have to escort them out of here; they can't stay here.' She said, 'Oh, no, they'll be staying here until we come back and get them.' And I said, 'You can't do that.' Now, these aren't Gary's rules. These aren't the Secret Service's rules. These are rules based on national security law. This is very important for your listeners to understand,"" Byrne stressed. ""She had started shirking these rules about national security way before the email server. She didn't want to hear anything about what the rules and the laws were, to protect the President's Oval Office and the information in it.""""So I got in a discussion, the assistant called me an a-hole, and a little while later, the first lady came up, and she walked right up to me - and you know, she's about five-foot-five; I'm about six-two - and she walked right up to me and she starts berating me. She calls me an a-hole, she refers to the uniformed division as an a-hole, and then she says - and she said this a couple of times, I talk about it in the book - 'We should have fired you all when we got here.' She wanted to fire a thousand federal police officers that protect her, twenty-four hours a day,"" he said incredulously.""She got so wrapped around the axle. And if she had just taken a breath - and, you know, I had already figured out a compromise because that's my job there ... to try to make things work. If they had just taken the people over across the hallway to the Roosevelt Room, and leave them there, and have somebody come down from her staff and sit with them, it would be fine. But then she threatened to call the director, and she did. A little while later, I got a phone call from an inspector, who said, 'Be prepared: you're going to get a phone call from the director's office.' I said,  'Okay.' The assistant director called my post and said, 'Tell me what's going on.' I explained it to him, and he said, 'You're doing the right thing. Thanks for making it work,'"" said Byrne.He said he wanted listeners to understand that ""when the American people voted Bill Clinton into office in the early nineties, they got Bill and Hillary, and if she gets elected, you're going to get Hillary and Bill.""""Here's the truth about that,"" Byrne continued. ""The things that made the economy decent were put into place before Bill Clinton got there, and he wasn't responsible for the things that they did. I mean, those ideals came from Mr. [Erskine] Bowles and Bob Rubin, who eventually became the secretary of the treasury. Those were their financial ideals, not Bill Clinton's. Listen, all Bill Clinton, in my experience, used those eight years as president to keep his perverted lifestyle and dating up. That's the only reason I see - and this is my take, after protecting him for eight years. That's the only reason he got into politics, is because he didn't have to get his hands dirty, and he used it to manipulate women and keep up his bizarre sex life. And that's no exaggeration, believe me. If your listeners get a chance to read my book, or do some research on the Internet, you'll see that that rings true.""""When it comes to Mrs. Clinton, she is involved in everything,"" he said. ""When a woman would surface and accuse him of doing something wrong, she was in charge of, they call it 'slut shaming.' They would berate these women. How is it that when a woman accuses Bill Clinton - they used this term one time; it drove me crazy: 'That's what you get when you drag a hundred-dollar bill through a trailer park.' Well, what's at the other end of that string? The other end of that string is Bill Clinton. Why does he get a pass and all these women get slut-shamed, and he gets away with it every time. It's incredible."" ""And she's in charge of it. She's the one that hammers these women, and they talk about it,"" Byrne said of Hillary Clinton. ""When you see these women like Juanita Broaddrick and Kathleen Willey tell their stories, if you can't understand what they're saying, and you can't believe them, then how is it that anybody else that's ever been assaulted, how come their stories are true, but these women are not?""Byrne referenced Eleanor Holmes Norton, congressional delegate from the District of Columbia, and her callous dismissal of Bill Clinton's accusers as ""middle-aged-looking women"" who were ""not looking their best, perhaps looking much better, you know, 40 years ago.""""They have Eleanor Holmes Norton come out and say that. They talk about their appearances. But let you and I say something about somebody's appearance, especially a woman, and they would try to hang us out to dry,"" he observed. ""What they do is, they say whatever they have to to distract you at the time. It may be negative. And because it's Eleanor Holmes Norton - you and I, most people, you don't expect any better out of her. So she can say whatever she wants, and then the Clinton machine mentality is, and this comes back from when Bill Clinton first started running from Arkansas, 'So what?' No matter what it is, they say, 'So what?' and they push forward.""""For instance, when you hear Hillary Clinton talking about Donald Trump's behavior, and the way he acts? What she's talking about, she's talking about herself. It's like she read my book, I swear. It's like she's channeling what I wrote about her in my book, and she's flipping it on him,"" Byrne declared. ""That's what they do. And the reason it's working is because the mainstream media buys into it. They don't call them on anything. They're really helping them get elected. They're doing more to get her elected than the people that are running her campaign.""Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.LISTEN:SIGN UPByrne began by saying he ""couldn't disagree with Glenn Beck more"" about the radio host's proclamation that voting for Hillary Clinton was a more moral choice than voting for Donald Trump.""Voting for Hillary Clinton is, to me, a complete mistake, and here's why: I started out in the U.S. Air Force. I had to pass a battery of tests to get to the point where, in the U.S. Air Force, I was allowed to protect our nuclear arsenal. I then went on to become a Secret Service uniformed division officer for 12 years, where I had to take a polygraph test. In eight out of those twelve years, I protected the Clintons, and the Hillary Clinton I know is a complete pathological liar,"" he said.""Really, if you're honest with yourself and you pay attention to some of the politics that goes on, you've seen this yourself,"" said Byrne. ""She never displays any kind of leadership. I cite many examples in my book where she gets so angry, she has the people that work for her, they're terrified of her.""He recounted a story from Crisis of Character about ""these three women who came up from Arkansas with her. They knew the Clintons. The one lady worked with her at the Rose Law Firm, and she knew that Mrs. Clinton's anger became so ferocious that she immediately started demanding people would get fired.""""In the incident that I'm talking about, these women made a mistake ordering some stationery, and I saw them talking about it,"" he continued. ""They really looked like they were afraid of something. I thought something was wrong, somebody was sick. And they explained to me what happened, that they had inadvertently allowed an intern to order some stationery, and the girl had made a mistake, so they had tens of thousands of copies of these invitations to the White House that were worth a lot of money, that were useless. And they weren't worried about the wasted taxpayer dollars. They were worried about who was gonna tell Hillary Clinton because they knew somebody was getting fired and sent back to Arkansas.""""That's just one example of her incredible anger toward people,"" said Byrne. ""She got so angry one time, she hit a Secret Service agent in the back of the head with a bible, sitting in a limousine. You just can't explain that away. And when you put that together with what we've seen today, she is completely inept when it comes to leadership.""""One day, I was standing at my post outside the Oval Office. It was during Christmastime, and they were decorating,"" he recalled. ""There was a group of women that had come up from Arkansas, volunteers to help decorate the White House. This is common, people come from all over the world. Mrs. Clinton was going to have a meeting with them over in the mansion, and they were going to come over to the Oval Office, and she was going to give them a tour and let them take pictures in the Oval Office.

It's how guys talk. Nevertheless, the Washington Post crowed: ""With less than a month to go, a major party is walking away from its nominee."" No, the people are walking away from the party. If the GOP abandons Donald Trump now -- a month before the election -- there will be no coming back from that. One month to go and these vicious cowards jump ship?John McCain, Mark Kirk, Kelly Ayotte, George Pataki - RINOs who never stood up for conservative principles are the Republicans disavowing Trump now. The GOP will not recover from this. We had to swallow their failures -- RINO McCain, spineless weak sister Mitt Romney -- and we did. We worked hard to elect them, but they were and are failures. The people picked Trump over the objections of the elites. And the elites would rather set our house on fire than back the people's candidate.If the elite right went after the opposition the way they've gone after Trump, they wouldn't be limping their way to oblivion.The uproar over Trump's remarks is manufactured and opportunistic outrage. For example, I was actually surprised by the decorum in Trump's conversation. He was respectful of the married woman's refusal. He was surprised that if you're famous, you can get all the sex you want. He was unashamedly heterosexual in his desires. He wanted to grab p--y, not force someone's head ""down"" a la Bill Clinton. He appreciates ""beautiful"" and wants to kiss her face, not have her immediately perform oral sex a la Bill Clinton, and he wants to be pleasing to her with Tic Tacs for his breath -- very considerate. A pass, a kiss, is not rape. For that, you'd have to ask Juanita Broaddrick.The gross betrayal is not Trump's alpha male banter, but these turncoats in the party. Did they ever take such a defiant stand against the treasonous actions of Obama and his running dogs? Trump is an alpha male. Gutless, weak metrosexuals like Barack Obama have almost destroyed America, and now the world is in chaos because of their actions. Trump was quite right - this is all a diversion from the real issues. He said in his statement:Let's be honest -- we're living in the real world. This is nothing more than a distraction from the important issues we're facing today. We are losing our jobs, we're less safe than we were eight years ago, and Washington is totally broken. Hillary Clinton and her kind have run our country into the ground.I've said some foolish things, but there's a big difference between the words and actions of other people. Bill Clinton has actually abused women, and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims.There is no comparison between Trump and the Clintons. None. Not only has Bill Clinton abused women. Hillary Clinton routinely abuses her secret service detail, once screaming at an agent: ""If you want to remain on this detail, get your f***ing ass over here and grab those bags!"" When one said to her, ""Good morning, ma'am,"" she replied: ""F**k off! It's enough that I have to see you ****-kickers every day, Just do your G*damn job and keep your mouth shut.""The selective outrage is astonishing. The liberals corrupted the culture. No one cares. Trump looks cool. They live by the sword and they will die by the sword. All of a sudden the liberals are prudish? Barack Obama says, ""Gotta have them ribs and p--y too,"" and crickets don't even bother to chirp. On the same day that the ""shocked"" Washington Post released the naughty Trump video, they ran a front-of-the-book news story how cyber-policing hurts prostitutes.Hollywood, too? Who stood by and did nothing why child actors were raped and trafficked? Hollywood actors and their sexcapades make Donald Trump look like a choirboy.Then there are the rappers, the darlings of the establishment that are shocked at what Trump said. ""Got that super soaker, p*ssy pop like cola coka/Plus it's tighter than a choka, got 'em smilin' like the Joka"" -Trump just got the Nicki Minaj voters. ""Imagine if I did that with your pearly on my tongue / I make that p*ssy talk to me / I could make it jump"" -- Trump will attract Lil Wayne voters. ""She make that assclap dancing like she on d-Bring it back I thru a stack, that's a lucky bitch"" -- Trump gets the Juicy J featuring, 2 Chainz and Lil Wayne vote. Kanye West said: ""I feel like Taylor Swift still owe me sex / Why? I made that bitch famous."" The Trump video will attract the Kimye vote.Trump must prevail. Trump has stood against Muslim migration. The consequences for American women if uncontrolled migration continues to take place will be far worse than Trump's macho talk.It's the end of us -- the end of freedom - if Hillary Clinton becomes President.Pamela Geller is the President of the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI), publisher of PamelaGeller.com and author of The Post-American Presidency: The Obama Administration's War on America and Stop the Islamization of America: A Practical Guide to the Resistance.

This tees up yet another case for an evenly divided Supreme Court, the balance of which will be decided by whether Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton is elected in November.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERDodd-Frank is a massive takeover of the U.S. financial system, just as the Affordable Care Act (""Obamacare"") was a takeover of the U.S. healthcare system. It was the brainchild of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who was a professor at the time. A central part of Dodd-Frank creates the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), headed by a director nominated by the president and then confirmed by the Senate.Companies on the receiving end of CFPB decisions have challenged its constitutionality. On Oct. 11, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit agreed with several of those challenges, striking down part of one of Obama's signature laws, one strongly supported by Clinton.Judge Brett Kavanaugh wrote for the three-judge panel in PHH Corporation v. CFPB:This is a case about executive power and individual liberty. The U.S. Government's executive power to enforce federal law against private citizens - for example, to bring criminal prosecutions and civil enforcement actions - is essential to societal order and progress, but simultaneously a grave threat to individual liberty.The Framers understood that threat to individual liberty. When designing the executive power, the Framers first separated the executive power from the legislative and judicial powers. ""The declared purpose of separating and dividing the powers of government, of course, was to 'diffus[e] power the better to secure liberty.'"" Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 721 (1986) (quoting Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring)). To ensure accountability for the exercise of executive power, and help safeguard liberty, the Framers then lodged full responsibility for the executive power in the President of the United States, who is elected by and accountable to the people. The text of Article II provides quite simply: ""The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America."" U.S. CONST. art. II, SS 1. And Article II assigns the President alone the authority and responsibility to ""take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed."" Id. SS 3. As Justice Scalia explained: ""The purpose of the separation and equilibration of powers in general, and of the unitary Executive in particular, was not merely to assure effective government but to preserve individual freedom."" Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 727 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting).Kavanaugh notes with alarm the vast powers of the ""headless fourth branch of government"" of agencies that are independent from presidential control, and thus not answerable to American voters. He continues, ""Because of their massive power and the absence of Presidential supervision and direction, independent agencies pose a significant threat to individual liberty and to the constitutional system of separation of powers and checks and balances.Although he criticizes independent agencies, he acknowledged that the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of such agencies in 1935, when the Court started its massive lurch to the left, in that case overruling prior precedent from 1926, which had held that the president must always be able to remove executive officers.What's different about the CFPB--and leaves the D.C. Circuit free to make a ruling not dictated by the Supreme Court's decisions in this area--is that all previous independent agencies were ""headed by multiple commissioners,"" making each one ""at least accountable to and by their fellow commissioners or board members.""Until the CFPB, which is ""headed by a single person,"" completely unaccountable to anyone.The court expressed concern that ""the CFPB possess enormous power over American business, American consumers, and the overall U.S. economy."" After surveying the contours of this power, the panel concluded, ""That combination of power that is massive in scope, concentrated in a single person, and unaccountable to the President triggers the important constitutional question at issue in this case.""Senior Judge Raymond Randolph joined Kavanaugh's opinion, but wrote separately to make additional points, including that parts of the controlling precedent in this case might be changed by the Supreme Court.Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson wrote separately to say that she agreed with the parts of the majority opinion rejecting on statutory grounds the CFPB's arguments in this case, and as such did not believe the court should reach the constitutional issues in the case.The Obama administration may petition the full D.C. Circuit to rehear the case en banc, where a liberal majority could reverse the panel decision. Either way, this case is likely to go to the U.S. Supreme Court in the next year.The case's outcome there could very easily turn on who is elected president on Nov. 8.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

"Apparently, everything is Vladimir Putin's fault in Hillary's alternative universe.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIt makes one wonder what Hillary meant when she declared a reset in U.S.-Russian relations -- something she bragged about in the second presidential debate -- way back when she was Secretary of State. Now after her ""reset,"" she blames Vladimir Putin for every revelation that comes out from WikiLeaks about the inner workings of her campaign machine. Apparently, she has reset the Russians right back to the 1950s and 60's. She is even going so far as to push our nation to the edge of war with Russia in Syria as she is urging that the U.S. impose a no-fly zone in the region that would bring U.S. airmen into direct combat action against Russian pilots to enforce it. Now, that's a Back to the Future sequel that I can do without.But at least the Clinton blame game theme is the same as it ever was, as she creates a tenuous discrediting argument against someone or something, like Putin and Wikileaks, as the source of the information shifting people's attention, magician-like, away from the leak's damaging content, and onto the purported leaker.  This way every revelation is tainted under suspicion of its origin rather than being evaluated on its own face value as to the damage it might have done to the country or more importantly to Hillary, to her political career.It is almost silly in its application, if you want to make Democratic National Committee email leaks showing that the primary was being rigged by Debbie Wasserman Schultz on behalf of Hillary against Bernie Sanders go away? It is easy peasy, the media makes it invisible because of the claim that Putin leaked it and is trying to influence the U.S. presidential election, and suddenly Hillary doesn't have to answer the question as to whether she legitimately won the nomination.As the latest WikiLeaks has revealed that Hillary complained in a paid, behind closed doors speech to Wall Street executives that Russia was funding ""fake environmental groups"" to stop energy development, the purported Russian source of the leak makes any questions about these ""fake environmental groups"" suddenly off limits.After all, everyone knows that former spymaster Vladimir Putin would foolishly out his covert operation in an attempt to embarrass Hillary rather than delete those emails before the leak. It seems that in Hillary's world only one politician is smart enough to delete embarrassing and criminal emails.Once whitewashed by the compliant media, Hillary will be able to avoid the obvious question about which enviro groups she believes are fake, and be asked to name all the environmental groups that have received Russian money to influence American energy policy. Of course it would also be good to know if any of these ""Russian"" funded groups were actively supporting her presidential campaign, because that would be real intervention by a foreign power into our electoral system. Unfortunately, that question is unlikely to be asked or answered as we will have already been urged to move on.Hillary's Benghazi whopper though may take the cake for her blame passing obfuscation game.  According to released emails between Hillary and her daughter, on the night of the attack while Americans were still battling for their lives, the Secretary of State asserted that Al Qaeda was behind that September 11 attack all the while pushing Susan Rice out the door to the media for the next week blaming the deaths of those four Americans on the reaction to a YouTube video that no one had ever seen. The YouTube blame landed the video producer in jail for about a year, and after years of stonewalling every investigation, Hillary famously exclaimed, ""at this point, what difference does it make?""And that in a nutshell is how Hillary deals with the daily swirl of crisis and corruption that surrounds her.  She blames someone or something else, fights tenaciously to keep her lie accepted by a friendly media, finally offers a tepid apology, and then ends by urging everyone to move on, as the issue has been dealt with already.In fact, the far left advocacy group MoveOn.org was created using this model, as their name refers to the grassroots effort they pushed on Clinton's behalf urging the nation to stop paying attention to Bill Clinton's White House intern problem and the trail of abused women he left in his wake and focus on other things. And with the see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil Clinton media, the simple distraction trick works like a charm.The irony that Hillary is trying to get the public to dwell on a leaked video from one of her corporate sponsors, NBC, that puts her opponent in a bad light due to more than a decade old crude sexual comment, all the while hoping the public forgets about her past role in viciously attacking her husband's sexual assault victims will be lost on the humorless left. A group that is so used to chanting ""move on"" in regards to Clinton corruption that they might get whiplash from this latest change in direction.The moral of the story is, when Hillary is blaming someone, chances are she is hiding something else.  In the case of the latest Wikileaks disclosures, she is hiding it in plain sight.The author is president of Americans for Limited GovernmentSIGN UP"	['Schultz', 'Sanders', 'Clinton']	[]

In it, Grunwald asked about Clinton's reported vacillation on gun control in the 2008 campaign and also about the tax. She said, ""I also saw something about her supporting a 25% tax on gun sales back in 1993.""ABC News reports that Clinton was ""unequivocal"" in her support for such a tax during her husband's presidency. On June 5, 2016, she told George Stephanopoulos her support for the tax was part of the nationalized healthcare push. She said, ""What I was saying back then was that we have a lot of public health costs that taxpayers end up paying for through Medicaid, Medicare, through uncompensated care, because that was in the context of the push for health care reform and that we needed some way to try to defray those costs.""But Clinton's comments to Stephanopoulos were as rooted in the present as they were in the past. For example, she referenced meeting with San Bernardino terror attack survivors, then said:When you have mass shootings, you not only have the terrible deaths, you have people who are injured. What they talked to me about was, where do they get the financial support to deal with both the physical and the emotional trauma. You know, is it a workman's comp support, which is one of the arguments? Is it private insurance, Is it because they work for the county, something the county should pay for?It must be noted that Clinton's 25 percent tax on gun sales would make poorer people less safe by pricing them out of the ability to be armed for self-defense. After all, a 25 percent tax on a $400 gun is $100-and that would be in addition to other taxes that are due at the state level.This is perfect example of the fallacy that gun controllers peddle when they present new gun laws as something that will make people less vulnerable. In truth, gun control only puts the vulnerable in a worse position. Clinton's gun tax would do this by simply making guns too expensive for many law-abiding, low income residents to afford.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
