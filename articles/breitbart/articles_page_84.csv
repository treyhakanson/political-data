Tim Kaine criticized Gov. Mike Pence's efforts to protect Indiana families from Syrian refugees who had not been vetted before being brought into this country, but, in fact, a federal appeals court bolstered Donald Trump's argument that if Americans want to change the nation's refugee policy, they need to vote Trump-Pence.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAs it became clear that President Barack Obama was importing thousands of Syrians who had not been vetted to ensure they were peaceful refugees who would assimilate into U.S. society and embrace American values, Governor Mike Pence issued an order declining to work with federal contractors to resettle those Syrians into parts of Indiana, in neighborhoods surrounded by Hoosier families.In the Refugee Act of 1980, Congress established a program for the federal government to work with the states to resettle refugees in the United States, under which companies performing the resettlement work can be reimbursed by the government. Exodus Refugee Immigration is one such organization, and sued Pence, alleging that only Congress and the president can make those decisions, not states and governors.On October 3, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit sided with Exodus, primarily on the ground that Pence had not presented evidence that the refugees in his state were dangerous.Pence readily accepted that fact during his masterful debate performance on Tuesday, explaining to his opponent Kaine that the federal government's obligation was to prove that these refugees were safe before bringing them to the Hoosier State, rather than dumping them into a civilian population without any idea of who they are or whether they are dangerous.""The FBI and [Department of] Homeland Security said we can't know for certain"" whether (or which) refugees coming from Syria are involved in Islamic terrorism, Pence explained. (Many undercover jihadist terrorists have entered Europe posing as refugees and have committed acts of terrorist acts in Germany and France.)""You've got to err on the side of the safety and security of the American people, Senator,"" Pence insisted.The Seventh Circuit took a different view in an opinion written by Judge Richard Posner, an appointee of Ronald Reagan, who, nonetheless, has been a longtime judicial activist who frequently expresses establishment elite views from the bench and even in newspaper op-eds. While the court did not dispute Pence's assertion that Indiana had a ""compelling interest in protecting its residents from the well-documented threat of terrorists posing as refugees to gain entry into Western countries,"" it noted that as of this date, no evidence has been unearthed showing that such undercover operatives are among the Syrians sent to Indiana.Posner exploited the opportunity of being the opinion's author to take a couple cheap shots at the vice presidential nominee, such as referring to Pence's concern for Hoosiers' safety as ""nightmare speculation""--an opinion that terrorist victims in Paris and Nice might not dismiss so breezily.But in Exodus Refugee Immigration v. Pence, Posner also quoted the provision in the Refugee Act at 8 U.S.C. SS 1157(a)(2), where Congress authorizes the president to decide on the basis of ""humanitarian concerns or ... the national interest"" how many refugees the federal government will admit each year into the United States.While the Chicago-based appeals court focused on the lack of evidence for or against terrorism (which is precisely the reason Pence issued the order that is being challenged in court--the Obama administration's failure to gather evidence one way or the other to vet thousands of Islamic refugees from this Middle Eastern war zone), the panel acknowledged that the federal government can conduct security screenings to keep out worrisome individuals.In doing so, the court reinforced a central theme of Trump's candidacy: America needs to adopt ""extreme vetting"" to ensure that as this nation opens its doors to the victims of war, it is also able to reliably exclude those who would bring the war to our shores.The appellate court held that Governor Pence does not have legal authority under federal law to make that decision, but also made indisputable that a Vice President Pence would be able to work with a President Trump to make precisely those decisions.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

They face a job market that has left even normally employable new college graduates out of work, or employed at well below their potential as baristas, temps, or in low-level retail jobs.Millennials understand that this situation will have a substantial impact on their lifetime earnings, due to depressed early years and and due to finding themselves on a lower income track than those few that landed higher-quality roles straight out of college.According to EIG cofounder and executive director Steve Glickman:The Millennial mindset was dramatically impacted by the harsh economic realities of the Great Recession, which has made them remarkably politically independent, economically pessimistic, and skeptical of traditional institutions. What the establishment doesn't understand is that in their minds, Millennials did all of the right things - they worked hard, got their education -- but they incurred huge amounts of debt and the job market they inherited hasn't rewarded any of these sacrifices. Now they are deeply concerned about their future.Key takeaways about Millennials from the survey:Millennials deeply admire entrepreneurship and believe it is the key to economic success, despite the fact that 90 percent of all new businesses fail within three years. Millennials also believe their biggest impediment to starting their own business is capital:Millennials have a very low level of confidence in American institutions. They are ""skeptical of the establishment,"" while ""remaining fiercely patriotic and supportive of a leading role for the United States in the world"":Millennials are generally comfortable with their own tax burden, but they remain concerned about fairness in the tax system.Millennials tend to prioritize federal spending on education and entitlements:The Millennial mindset was dramatically impacted by the harsh economic realities of the Great Recession, which has made them remarkably politically independent, economically pessimistic, and skeptical of traditional institutions.

At this rate, the country is on track to resettle more than 150,000 refugees in the fiscal year, a rate almost double the 84,995 resettled in FY 2016, and more than 40,000 greater than the 110,000 the Obama administration has proposed for FY 2017.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERA total of 2,058 refugees from all countries have been resettled in the United States during the first five days of FY 2017, according to the Department of State's interactive website.As a point of comparison, only 65 refugees from all countries were resettled in the United States during the first five days of FY 2016.Forty-five percent of the FY 2017 refugees-to-date, or 921 out of 2,058, were Muslim.""My post from last week shows the monthly admissions of refugees since 2006. The October average is traditionally the lowest resettlement month of the year. One October, 2006, we only brought in 1,009 refugees, more than 1,000 fewer than President Obama has brought in over the first five days of October 2017,"" Ann Corcoran, who founded the Refugee Resettlement Watch blog in 2007, tells Breitbart News.""They build in August and September because they are usually desperate to hit their fiscal year ceiling by then. So to have this extraordinarily high rate this October, it confirms our greatest fear that President Obama will pour as many refugees as he can  before he leaves office, and before a potential Trump administration takes the reins,"" she adds.""This explains why the State Department is on a quiet mission to open as many new resettlement sites in the country as they can,"" she says.In the eleven fiscal years between FY 2006 and FY 2016, the October monthly admission of refugees to the United States averaged 3,704. (40,749 refugees were admitted during the month of October during these eleven years).Until this year, the highest monthly total of refugees resettled during the month of October was 6,352, the number that came in during October 2014, the first month of FY 2015.This October, the Obama administration is on a record path to double that number. At a rate of 411 refugees per day, 12,741 refugees will be resettled in October 2016, the first month of FY 2017.""If Hillary Clinton is elected, she will be on a glide path to reach 200,000 refugees in FY 2017 easily,"" Corcoran adds. ""She can use emergency power under the Refugee Act to bring in more refugees than the 110,000 ceiling Obama presented to Congress.""""A Donald Trump administration could turn off the refugee spigot,"" she says.News of President Obama's  rush to resettle refugees during the final month of his administration confirms their statements that, if elected, Hillary Clinton is likely to resettle more than 200,000 refugees annually, critics of the federal refugee resettlement program tell Breitbart News.It also highlights a major issue that divides the presidential election between Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and running mate Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, on the one hand, and Republican nominee Donald Trump and running mate Indiana Gov. Mike Pence on the other.Clinton and Kaine have publicly embraced bringing in 65,000 Syrian refugees annually, and have not rejected calls by the Refugee Council USA, the lobbying arm of the lucrative refugee resettlement industry, to resettle 200,000 refugees annually in the United States.In contrast, as Pence said in the vice-presidential debate on Tuesday, ""Donald Trump and I are committed to suspending the Syrian refugee program and programs and immigration from areas of the world that have been compromised by terrorism.""As Breitbart News reported, ""according to the new Breitbart/Gravis poll released on Wednesday, voters overwhelmingly agree with Trump and Pence on the Syrian refugees issue.""In the  national poll of 1,690 registered  voters conducted on October 3, sixty-two percent oppose increasing Syrian refugees, while 54 percent said they do not believe the claim by President Barack Obama that Syrian refugees have been subjected to the most rigorous security vetting.At least one member of Congress says it's time for the bureaucrats who run the resettlement program to listen to the voice of the people.""We are losing our country whose sole premise is that we are a nation under the law and that we the people are the true Sovereign we are not ruled from a distant palace,"" Virginia Republican Rep. Dave Brat tells Breitbart News.""This refugee crisis response has not ever been put before the American people and our Congress has also given up any semblance of oversight as we voluntarily cede our control over the entire budget process to the new Sovereign in the executive branch,""Brat adds.""On the technical side it is true we have the most sophisticated vetting system in the world the system is just phenomenal but the only problem is that there are no data to use in this super system so we are allowing refugees in with no knowledge of who they are and who has sent them and where their true allegiance lies,"" Brat adds.Texas leads the way with 220 refugees resettled in the five days between October 1 and October 5, followed by California (159), Arizona (152), Michigan (118),  New York  (96),  Ohio (96), North Carolina (78),  Pennsylvania (78), Minnesota (77),  Illinois (67),  Georgia (62),  Kentucky (59), Nevada (49), Idaho (45), Maryland (42),  Missouri (41),  Massachusetts (41),  and Colorado (40).Twenty-nine refugees from South Sudan, Iraq, Burma, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Afghanistan were resettled in the small city of Twin Falls, Idaho (population 78,000) alone, more than were resettled in two dozen states over the five day period.Fed up with the federal government's failure to guarantee that the thousands of refugees brought in to the state meet security vetting standards, Gov. Greg Abbott announced last month that the state of Texas is withdrawing from the federal refugee resettlement program in January.The Obama administration resettled 265 Syrian refugees in the United States during the first five days of Fiscal Year 2017 according to the Department of State's interactive website, putting it on a pace to resettle 19,345 annually. In FY 2016, more than 12,500 Syrian refugees were resettled in the United States. In the previous four fiscal years, about 2,300 Syrian refugees were resettled in the country.California led the way with 40 Syrian refugees resettled in the first five days of FY 2017, followed by Michigan (39), Texas (33), Arizona (3O), Maryland (21), and New York (20), Georgia (14), and Nevada (12).Oakland County, Michigan continued to be a favorite destination selected by the Department of State, with 12 resettled refugees, more than 42 states.Oakland County Executive L. Brooks Patterson said last month Oakland County will sue the federal government for placing refugees in the county without complying with the ""consultation clause"" of the Refugee Act of 1980.One local citizens group, Secure Michigan, opposes the continuation of the federal refugee resettlement program in the state.""We the people of Michigan just lost a massive legal case to the DOJ and CAIR that will pay mosque developers $1.7 Million and allow them to build a brand new ""Shariahville: -- houses, mosque, school, etc. in a residential area. These explosive refugee numbers from Shariah-compliant countries warn us that Oakland County and the rest of Michigan will likely become infested with a collection of No-Go Shariahvilles, where women are treated as property, unless some brave person can put stop to the invasion,"" a spokesperson for Secure Michigan tells Breitbart News.Though Congress has not passed a full year's budget for FY 2017 or acted on Obama's proposal to bring in 110,000 refugees in FY 2017, the interim ten week budget passed by Congress to cover expenditures between October 1 and December 9 provides the Department of State and the Office of Refugee Resettlement more than enough funding to front load the process and bring in refugees at the accelerated rate of 150,000 per year.""Republicans in Congress went along with funding refugee resettlement at least at the FY16 levels at least through December so really, all the VOLAGs [voluntary agencies, also referred to as resettlement agencies] need to be concerned about is whether they can get the refugee per capita payment (taxpayer money). They get their cut and then the refugee individual gets their share,"" an attorney familiar with the refugee resettlement program tells Breitbart News.The short and long term costs are shifted to state and local governments.  Welfare expenditures operate like a bottomless pit and regardless of the tall tales being told about refugee ""economic self-sufficiency,"" the data on sustained refugee welfare usage speaks for itself. The refugee resettlement agencies located in our cities and towns are obligated at most to a 90 day commitment to the refugees they import into a community, so as long as they can get the per capita, they can keep the pipeline running.For Brat, the solution to the problem is evident, and in the hands of the American people.""On November 8, we can choose to make our country great again,"" he tells Breitbart News.In the  national poll of 1,690 registered  voters conducted on October 3, sixty-two percent oppose increasing Syrian refugees, while 54 percent said they do not believe the claim by President Barack Obama that Syrian refugees have been subjected to the most rigorous security vetting.The short and long term costs are shifted to state and local governments.

The Chicago Tribune pronounced last rites in September with an editorial entitled ""Why ObamaCare Failed,"" decrying the ""staggering price hikes"" and ""drastically fewer choices of plans"" awaiting Illinois customers in the next enrollment period.Minnesota is even further down the road to misery than Illinois, with Bloomberg News warning that its individual market is on ""the brink of collapse"" as premiums soar by 50 to 67 percent. The state commerce commissioner, Mike Rothman -- an appointee of Democrat Governor Mark Dayton -- conceded that even these stunning rate hikes were merely a ""stopgap for 2017"" to avert disaster.Big insurers like Blue Cross/Blue Shield are pulling out of the state exchanges after heavy financial losses, while others plan to limit enrollment, creating what state Republican House Speaker Kurt Daudt accurately described as ""a health care crisis for thousands of Minnesota families.""Tennessee's insurance commissioner Julie Mix McPeak said her state system was also ""very near collapse"" in August, for much the same reason as Minnesota's calamity: soaring premiums combined with insurers bailing out of the market. Over 650 counties across the nation are down to a single ObamaCare insurance provider.Speaking of emergency stopgap measures, we learned in recent days that ObamaCare would have collapsed already, if the administration wasn't breaking the law by pouring billions of taxpayer dollars into the coffers of ailing insurance companies. ObamaCare's federal mandarins were legally barred from bailing out their partners in the insurance industry, but they did it anyway.Even the New York Times admitted the ""ailing Obama health care act may have to change to survive,"" which is another way of saying it's a failure in its current form... and it can only be saved by the Republicans who refused to vote for the Affordable Care Act while accurately predicting its failure.ObamaCare's dwindling band of defenders routinely confuse Medicaid enrollment with ObamaCare enrollment, and ignore the huge number of Americans who lost perfectly decent plans despite President Obama's false promises, to produce wildly inflated numbers of people who supposedly gained health insurance due to the Affordable Care Act.Not only is this a fraudulent justification for the program -- no hard-working American should suffer unfairly to sustain a broken scheme that managed to insure a few people, at outrageous cost -- but Medicaid was not in good shape to begin with, and it's getting worse. Democrats are trying very hard to avoid discussion of the ObamaCare disaster today. They'll be trying not to talk about the ObamaCare-inflicted Medicaid disaster tomorrow.""The federal government's 100% financing of state spending on expansion enrollees has led states to boost enrollment and create high payment rates,"" Brian Blase of the Mercatus Center reported at Forbes last month.""In states that have expanded, enrollment and per enrollee spending are nearly 50% higher than predicted. While interest groups within the states - particularly hospitals and insurers - benefit from the higher spending being charged to federal taxpayers, substantial evidence suggests much of this new spending is wasted or provides little value for its intended recipients,"" the Mercatus study revealed.Blase further observed that beneficiaries ""obtain low value"" through the Medicaid expansion, while the amount lost to waste, fraud, and abuse is increasing, as improper spending ""exploded"" from $26 billion to $67 billion between 2013 and 2016.In a sense, Democrats can point to the 36% approval number in the new Breitbart/Gravis poll as a political success, because the number of people willing to describe ObamaCare as a success is considerably higher than the number who have actually been helped by the program.Frankly, the only reason the Affordable Care Act can squeeze a thumbs-up from a third of the populace is that the employer-provided insurance market is working far better than the individual marketplace... and that's the part of the insurance system people were largely content with, before hundreds of billions of dollars were poured into ObamaCare. Hard-working Americans should not be made to suffer any longer so that Democrats can enjoy a little political success.SIGN UP"

The former vice president, a climate activist, will speak about not just Clinton's plan to address global warming, but also the idea that voting for an independent presidential candidate could deliver the White House to Republicans in the same way that Ralph Nader's candidacy helped undermine his presidential bid in 2000.Well, perhaps. An alternative possibility is that Gore's intervention will focus voters' attention on one of Hillary's biggest weaknesses: her dedication to an anti-science, anti-human, anti-free-markets ideology which, in defiance of reason or evidence, seeks to hamstring U.S. industry and punish consumers in the name of dealing with a non-existent problem.Make no mistake, environmentalism is one of the clearest and most important points of difference between the two main presidential candidates.Under a Hillary presidency, green crony capitalism will flourish: the corrupt, meddling, dishonest Environmental Protection Agency will grow more powerful and intrusive; activist groups like the Sierra Club and The Nature Conservancy will grow more shrill and demanding in their war on freedom and property rights; fossil fuel producers (coal especially) will be punished while more taxpayers' money will be squandered on subsidising bat-chomping, bird-slicing eco-crucifixes and other ""clean energy"" ventures; regulations on everything from zoning to agricultural land-use to clean air will grow more stringent; enviro-capitalist cronies like Tom Steyer will be enriched; energy intensive industries will be punished; consumers will be hit in the pocket.Under a Trump presidency, the green blob will be slain causing massive - but necessary - stock market disruption as the entire, Enron-inspired green Ponzi scheme unravels and the Augean stables containing three or four decades' worth of environmentalist ordure are finally swept clean.Which, of course, is one reason why the liberal media - which for years has been unquestioningly pushing the green narrative without doing any due diligence as to its accuracy - is having such conniptions at the prospect of a Trump victory. According to this WaPo editorial, Trump will cue the arrival of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, at the very least.It took global negotiators a quarter-century to strike the Paris climate agreement, an international accord aimed at slowing global warming. The agreement represents the best hope for a world in which no one country acting alone can do enough to fight this global threat. Donald Trump could destroy the agreement with a stroke of a pen, and with it any hope that the world will keep the planet's temperature within the boundaries scientists say are safe.The Paris deal represents a major U.S. commitment, but it is not a treaty with the force of law. President Obama submitted the U.S. emissions goal; Mr. Trump could withdraw it just as easily. He also could deeply undercut or eliminate the basis for any future U.S. commitment. Mr. Trump has promised to rescind the Clean Power Plan, which obliges electrical utilities to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions by cutting down on coal burning and increasing their use of natural gas and renewables. The Environmental Protection Agency drew up the plan using authorities that Congress gave it decades ago in the Clean Air Act. Mr. Trump could press the agency to revoke it or water it down.Mr. Trump also would have considerable sway over the state of the nation's land and water. He has promised to use that power to quash regulations on drilling and to open federal lands to coal, oil and gas production. He could do more; for example, he could attempt to use executive discretion over drilling royalties, pipeline construction, permitting, drilling leases, oil and gas exports, and other matters to reward firms and people he likes or to punish those he does not.All this is true, but in a good way. Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, though it would largely be a symbolic gesture because the agreement is not legally binding and therefore meaningless, would represent a bravura act of trolling; but rescinding the Clean Power Plan would cut costs to business and benefit consumers, while opening up federal lands to the oil and gas industries would drastically increase the fracking boom which has brought America prosperity and increased energy independence.Those who worry about the environmental costs should be aware that the EPA's clean air policies are a) based on the junkiest of rigged junk science and b) that the difference it makes to ""global warming"" - if any - will be immeasurably small. By the end of the century, Bjorn Lomborg has calculated, America's Clean Power Plan will reduce the world's increase in temperatures by a spectacular 0.004 degrees C. Yes, that's four thousandths of a degree! The decision by Gore to plunge into the campaign during the final weeks shows the extent to which Democrats remain concerned that Clinton has yet to connect with many millennials, some of whom are backing third-party candidates this year. The former vice president, a climate activist, will speak about not just Clinton's plan to address global warming, but also the idea that voting for an independent presidential candidate could deliver the White House to Republicans in the same way that Ralph Nader's candidacy helped undermine his presidential bid in 2000.

The Environmental Protection Agency drew up the plan using authorities that Congress gave it decades ago in the Clean Air Act. Mr. Trump could press the agency to revoke it or water it down.
Mr. Trump also would have considerable sway over the state of the nation's land and water. He has promised to use that power to quash regulations on drilling and to open federal lands to coal, oil and gas production. He could do more; for example, he could attempt to use executive discretion over drilling royalties, pipeline construction, permitting, drilling leases, oil and gas exports, and other matters to reward firms and people he likes or to punish those he does not.

Aren't you? This is the kind of immoral garbage President Obama and his administration are allowing to be put in place in our country. $8.4 million a year--with all the things our military needs--can you believe that? Things like this need to be stopped. It just shows you how morally warped our politicians have become.As USA Today reports, beginning in October, the federal government will be funding ""gender reassignment treatments"" and surgeries for soldiers who claim to be transgender. The cost is expected to be between $2.4 million and $8.4 million annually.A recent RAND Corp. study for the Pentagon finds between 1,320 and 6,630 transgender troops in the active-duty force of 1.3 million.According to the study, between 30 and 140 hormone treatments and between 25 and 130 sex-change surgeries would be provided per year to active service members. Other healthcare costs could be between $2.4 million and $8.4 million.A policy statement released by Defense Secretary Ash Carter in June states: ""[T]ransgender individuals shall be allowed to serve in the military,"" and that ""open service by transgender Service members... is consistent with military readiness and with strength through diversity.""Additionally, the Defense Department says a service member's medical condition or treatment ""related to their gender identity"" will be treated. Beginning October 3, Tricare will cover hormone treatments and therapy for service personnel with gender dysphoria. Sex-change surgeries will be performed at a military hospital or, if unavailable, at a private hospital.Like Graham, Ron Crews, executive director of Chaplain Alliance for Religious Liberty, said the government's use of taxpayer funds for transgender treatments is inefficient since service members having treatments or surgeries will be unable to be deployed for long periods of time.""I think this is a gross misuse of military medical dollars that should be used to make our military forces deployable or to help those who are wounded or injured while they are deployed,"" he said, adding that the military is now also spending funds on ""tremendous amounts of training"" on transgender education.[W]hen I read about the government spending $8.4 million of taxpayers' money a year--starting today--for things like gender reassignment and hormone therapy for military personnel, I'm disgusted!

Loretta Sanchez (D-CA) squared off Wednesday evening at the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at Cal State Los Angeles in their only debate of the U.S. Senate race in California.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe two Democrats, who face off in the November 8 general election thanks to California's ""top two"" or ""jungle"" primary system, provided few policy differences but many personal attacks over an hour that offered little new information, or hope, to voters.Harris, who leads in the polls and enjoys the endorsement of Democratic Party officials from President Barack Obama on down, came across as arrogant, condescending, and disdainful. She made little effort to appeal to the voters, and seemed content to cast aspersions on her opponent. Sanchez, on the other hand, came across as overly eager to appease viewers, speaking directly to the camera in a highly animated manner, and becoming overly defensive about her record in office.For conservatives watching the race, there was little to enjoy. The moderators did a reasonable job of asking pertinent questions about the economy, foreign policy, and issues like immigration. But the candidates stayed firmly within the left-wing paradigm. Neither had anything of interest to say about water issues, for example, with Harris focusing on conservation measures and Sanchez boasting about the new innovation that is taking place in her Southern California stomping ground.The only point of relative interest was when Harris attacked Sanchez for stating that up to 20 percent of Muslims support terror. Sanchez, who serves on the U.S. House Homeland Security Committee had been citing global polling data, but Harris and others had cast her remarks as anti-Muslim. At the debate, Sanchez accused Harris of distorting her words -- and that was that.Neither candidate provided any sign that she would much more than a reliable party-line vote in the Senate.Joel B.

Martin was supposedly discovered in an investigation of theft and disclosure of a large cache of top-secret NSA spying tools.During a search of Mr. Martin's residence, agents found paper documents and digital drives that were labeled ""top secret,"" including six classified documents that were written in 2014, according to an affidavit filed in conjunction with his arrest.The FBI affidavit said: ""During the interview, Martin at first denied, and later when confronted with specific documents, admitted he took documents and digital files from his work assignment to his residence and vehicle that he knew were classified.""But Martin has now been alleged to have also stolen ""Sensitive Compartmented Information"" (SCI), which Breitbart sources referred to as NSA's ""crown jewels."" These are offensive algorithms used in cyberattacks on foreign military and government systems.Unlike Snowden, who exposed files to demonstrate that the NSA was illegally spying on every American citizen, Martin allegedly operated under the dark net moniker of ""Shadow Brokers"" to hack the NSA Equation Group's cyber-mining tools. He then offered to sell the wildly valuable cyber-secrets for 1 million bitcoins, or about $560 million.During the months of August and September, the Obama administration was claiming that the devastating hack of the Democrat National Committee (DNC) by Guccifer 2.0 was a in reality a covert operation by the Russian FSB's Institute of Cryptography and Protection of Information (IKSI) that is tasked with cyber-warfare.President Obama used a press conference on August 4 regarding the DNC break-in to state, ""If in fact Russia engaged in this activity, it's just one on a long list of issues that me and Mr. Putin talk about and that I've got a real problem with.""The arrest of an NSA insider after two months of the President claiming the Russians were responsible for national security hacking raises concerns that his administration may have been using a ""false flag"" to cover-up their its own incompetence in protecting cyber-secrets from disgruntled or greedy employees.Following Snowden's 2013 intelligence breaches, the Administration's investigation and after-action corrective action plan should have entailed tremendous enhanced surveillance, countermeasures and staff vetting at Booz Allen to make sure that U.S. cyber-security operations are impenetrable from the outside and from the inside.Although Martin is suspected of taking the highly classified NSA ""source code"" developed to break into foreign computer networks, the Times reported late Wednesday that two intelligence sources tried to downplay the theft by claiming some of the information the contractor is suspected of stealing was ""dated.""Snowden chimed in on Twitter from somewhere in Russia: ""This is huge. Did the FBI secretly arrest the person behind the reports NSA sat on huge flaws in US products?""Mr. Martin's lawyer, Jim Wyda, said the charges ""are mere allegations ... There is no evidence that Hal Martin intended to betray his country. What we do know is that Hal Martin loves his family and his country.""

Pence had made the comment earlier that day in an exclusive with Breitbart News.Clinton previously called half of Trump supporters the ""basket of deplorables,"" ""irredeemable,"" and ""not America."" Clinton later expressed regret for saying ""half,"" a fact that Pence reminded America of in Tuesday night's Vice Presidential debate against Clinton's running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine.Pence told the enthusiastic crowd at the Granville Volunteer Fire Company that Trump will stand with the law enforcement community and first responders and will restore law and order to every community in Pennsylvania and this nation.The choice in this election is about security, prosperity, SCOTUS, and integrity in the highest office in the land, Pence told the crowd. When people are looking for change, the other side has put up a candidate that ""literally personifies a failed establishment in WADC,"" said Pence.He brought up Clinton's mishandling of classified information on a private server, deleting of emails and referenced the Clinton Foundation when he spoke of the Hillary and former President Bill Clinton setting up a private foundation that allowed the taking tens of millions from foreign governments. Under U.S. election law, foreign donors cannot give money to U.S. candidates.Pence told the battleground Pennsylvania crowd to tell their fellow voters:If you want a President who will cut taxes, grow this economy, squeeze every nickel out of that bloated federal bureaucracy and repeal Obamacare lock stock and barrel and then you tell 'em, tell 'em if you want a President who will build a wall, secure our borders, and enforce the laws of this nation for the citizens of this nation and if you want a president, if you want a president who will upend the status quo in Washington D.C. and uphold the Constitution of the Untied States of America, then you gotta tell your neighbors and friends you've got have one choice, if you want all of that.

Donald Trump's vision to Make America Great Again won that debate.Pence made similar comments earlier at his Shenandoah Valley rally at the Rockingham County Fairgrounds. Even a Democrat-leaning CNN poll of debate watchers showed Pence winning the night over Kaine. That poll also showed the 29 percent of those polled moved toward voting for Trump after watching the VP debate.Pence continued, ""...and when we take that vision to every corner of Pennsylvania and every corner of the United States of America, that man and that vision is gonna win that debate all the way to the White House.""Pence tweeted out photos of the crowd gathered at the Granville Volunteer Fire Company:Enthusiastic crowd at the Grantville Volunteer Fire Company!

He noted that Kerry and Lavrov also discussed North Korea and Ukraine.Toner said Kerry had also spoken about Syria with the top diplomats from Britain, the European Union, France, Germany, Turkey and Qatar.The call with Lavrov ""was part of those multilateral efforts now that are going to continue because we recognize they got to be part of the conversation,"" Toner said. He said the suspension of contacts with Russia had to do only with implementing a cease-fire that Kerry and Lavrov had agreed to on Sept. 9 but that quickly broke down.The US suspended that engagement Monday due to continued deteriorating conditions in Aleppo but said it would remain active in seeking peace.Toner said Kerry would be ""remiss"" not to raise concerns with Russia about what is happening in Aleppo, where Syrian forces backed by Russian air power are conducting air raids on rebel-held parts of the city.SIGN UP"

Aquila has told Catholics that life issues--and especially opposition to abortion--must take absolute precedence in deciding whom to vote for in November's elections.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""Catholics in good conscience cannot support candidates who will advance abortion,"" he wrote in the diocesan newspaper, The Denver Catholic.Although the Archbishop refrains from telling Catholics which ticket to support, he makes his own position clear: favor pro-life politicians and those who will support religious liberty. In this election, that means voting Republican.Going through a point-by-point comparison between the two parties, Aquila said that the ""most important"" change to official party platforms this year has been the Democrats' push to overturn the Hyde Amendment, which ""prohibits federal taxpayer money from being used for abortion.""The Democrats' platform is ""aggressively pro-abortion, not only in funding matters, but in the appointment of only those judges who will support abortion,"" Aquila laments. They are even trying to repeal the Helms Amendment, which ""prevents the U.S. from supporting abortion availability overseas,"" he said.With an evident swipe at ""Catholic"" vice-presidential candidate Tim Kaine, who declares himself ""personally opposed"" to abortion while continuing to support it consistently with his votes, Aquila decried those who divide ""the personal"" from ""the public.""On the other side of the coin, ""the Republican party platform is supportive of the Hyde Amendment and just this year strengthened its support for life by calling for the defunding of Planned Parenthood, banning dismemberment abortion and opposing assisted suicide,"" he said.Regarding another key issue, freedom of religion and freedom of conscience, Aquila blasted the Democrats' Health and Human Services mandate that ""requires the provision of contraceptives, sterilizations and some abortifacients through employer's health plans.""He underscored the Obama Administration's vicious attacks on the Little Sisters of the Poor, which has endeavored ""to force them to violate their consciences.""When people of faith do not stand up for their beliefs, ""the government will become 'god' and impose its beliefs on the citizens,"" the Archbishop warned. ""One only needs to look to the Health and Human Service contraceptive mandate, or the attempt by President Obama to force a transgender agenda onto public schools.""Catholic voters ""must make themselves aware of where the parties stand on these essential issues,"" Aquila wrote. ""The right to life is the most important and fundamental right, since life is necessary for any of the other rights to matter.""The Archbishop explicitly refuted attempts to assert the ""moral equivalency"" of different ethical and social issues at play in the upcoming elections.""There are some issues that can legitimately be debated by Christians, such as which policies are the most effective in caring for the poor, but the direct killing of innocent human life must be opposed at all times by every follower of Jesus Christ. There are no legitimate exceptions to this teaching,"" he said.The Archbishop acknowledged that for many, the presidential election will involve a choice between ""the lesser of two evils,"" observing that both candidates ""are disliked, lack credibility, and have made comments that make the hair on the back of your neck stand up.""At the same time, Christians must ""reflect on the platforms of both parties, with an emphasis on the human life issues,"" he said.If you truly live your Catholic faith, ""you will not find complete alignment with any political party, and that is okay,"" Aquila said, but in voting, Catholics must ""look at how each party platform supports human life from conception through natural death, the freedom of religion and the freedom of conscience, the family, and the poor.""""The health of our nation depends on a deep respect for human life from the moment of conception until natural death, and the future of our society depends on how we protect that right. If we don't, eventually we will go the way of Rome and Greece and other great civilizations that have risen and fallen,"" he said.Follow Thomas D. Williams on Twitter Follow @tdwilliamsromeSIGN UP"

Ultimately, Robertson explains that this is just the latest chapter in a conflict spanning two millennia, described by Augustine of Hippo as the City of Man in opposition to the City of God.Torchbearer--directed by Stephen K. Bannon, produced by Bannon and David Bossie, and written by Bannon, Zach Dasher, and Breitbart News Senior West Coast Editor Rebecca Mansour--gives the viewer a whirlwind tour of world history with a focus on the Christian experience from apostolic times to the present, showcasing the pattern of how godless humanity descends into depravity, in stark contrast to the sublime virtues with which God's people adorn their lives in the face of adversity--all narrated in the iconic voice of the Duck Commander.Torchbearer's trailer takes the viewer on a global odyssey from the Areopagus in Athens, to St. Peter's Square and the Coliseum Rome, to countless rows of white crosses in Normandy, to a jail cell in Birmingham. The full documentary delves deep into each of these venues and more, in a movie that is simultaneously fast-paced yet thought-provoking.""Social Darwinism. Survival of the fittest."" That is how Robertson summarizes a godless view of human existence, explaining that if there is no higher being to whom man is accountable, the motto becomes, ""Might makes right.""Regimes based upon a worldview that rejects God's authority become violently hostile to those who peacefully live out biblical faith. Ancient Rome was the first example of this after the death and resurrection of Christ, as Christians would not join the new cult of emperor worship. ""Christians did not mind praying for the emperor, but they would not pray to the emperor,"" Robertson explained.When ordered to offer a small pinch of incense as a sign of worship to the Roman emperor, Christians went willingly to their deaths instead--and were slaughtered en masse.Pivoting to those people, Robertson explains that God is ""the creator of all things. God created man and woman in his image. We are image-bearers of God.""However, ""once you forget where your rights come from... oh my goodness,"" Robertson sighs. He lays out ""an indictment of the human race,"" quoting from Romans 1:28, ""Since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done.""Torchbearer links respect for human rights and a willingness to defend human dignity to faith in God, focusing on the selfless works of service and charity earnestly carried out by countless people of faith.The film also explores the price that countless Christians have paid for their commitment to follow Jesus Christ, beginning with the martyrdom of the apostles Peter and Paul.Stories like these do not merely belong in the past, however, or found solely overseas. Although punishments here have not yet come close to being violent, observant Christians in America are suffering lesser forms of punishment for declining to offer a pinch of incense to the emperor, consequences that are increasing both in frequency and in severity.Just in the past few years:In fact, several of these cases arose just in the past year, and some are still in court today, or are about to go to court. And these are only a fraction of the current struggles going on in America involving observant Christians and people of other faiths.I should know. In addition to being an editor for Breitbart News, I'm a senior attorney at First Liberty Institute, the law firm representing each one of these committed Christians who are suffering what some could call ""soft persecution""--nonviolent yet severe personal consequences--because they will not compromise their faith in what they say or how they live their lives.This provocative documentary is designed to inform Americans and give an eternal and spiritual perspective on all these things, setting them in their historical context, and urging people to act--and to repent--before it's too late.Torchbearer is coming to select theaters on Oct. 7, to be followed by release on various digital and VOD platforms, including Comcast, Dish, iTunes, Vudu, Amazon, and more.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News and senior counsel at First Liberty Institute, the largest law firm in America exclusively dedicated to protecting religious liberty.

""Together, the Syrian regime and Russia seem to have rejected diplomacy, in the furtherance of trying to pursue a military victory, over the broken bodies, the bombed-out hospitals, the traumatized children of a long-suffering land.""Tensions between Russia and the United States intensified after the Obama administration announced Monday that it was ending talks with Russia over the war in Syria, accusing the Kremlin of the breakdown in negotiations.The Post reports:U.S. military strikes against the Assad regime will be back on the table Wednesday at the White House, when top national security officials in the Obama administration are set to discuss options for the way forward in Syria. But there's little prospect President Obama will ultimately approve them.""There's an increased mood in support of kinetic actions against the [Assad] regime,"" an anonymous senior administration official told WaPo. ""The CIA and the Joint Staff have said that the fall of Aleppo would undermine America's counterterrorism goals in Syria.""Early on in the Syrian civil war, President Barack Obama called for regime change and threatened airstrikes against the Assad regime after accusing the Syrian dictator of using chemical weapons in 2013.However, so far Obama has only authorized strikes against the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) and al-Qaeda-linked groups in Syria.The Obama administration has provided military assistance to some anti-Assad rebels but has largely favored diplomacy over armed intervention as a means of dethroning the Syrian leader.Meanwhile, Russia has remained Assad's most important ally, placing Washington and the Kremlin on opposite sides of the conflict.The various ceasefires negotiated by the U.S. have all failed. The Obama administration attempted to bring peace to Syria with the help of Russia, but that effort fell apart this week.Following the unraveling of the Syria peace efforts, Kerry accused Russia of ""favoring war over diplomacy amid widening rifts with Washington,"" notes The Post.""People that are serious about pursuing peace behave differently from the way Russia has chosen how to behave,"" declared the secretary.The suspension of negotiations ""does not come lightly,"" he added, denouncing Russia's alliance with Assad as ""irresponsible and profoundly ill-advised.""According to the U.S. State Department, negotiations aimed at ensuring the safety of pilots from Russia and the United States will carry on.Kerry was a strong supporter of Obama's initial plan to launch airstrikes against Assad after the Syrian dictator used chemical weapons.""He has complained privately that White House resistance to more intervention has hurt efforts to persuade Russia, in particular, to take a tougher tone with Assad,"" reported the Associated Press (AP) in June.That month, a ""dissent channel cable"" signed by nearly 50 mid-level U.S. State Department officials who deal with U.S. policy in Syria advocated military action against Assad, including ""targeted airstrikes.""WaPo now reports that the Obama administration is once again considering bombing Assad, noting that the president will likely remain opposed to such a move.The Post notes:Last Wednesday, at a Deputies Committee meeting at the White House, officials from the State Department, the CIA and the Joint Chiefs of Staff discussed limited military strikes against the regime as a means of forcing Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad to pay a cost for his violations of the cease-fire, disrupt his ability to continue committing war crimes against civilians in Aleppo, and raise the pressure on the regime to come back to the negotiating table in a serious way.The options under consideration, which remain classified, include bombing Syrian air force runways using cruise missiles and other long-range weapons fired from coalition planes and ships, an administration official who is part of the discussions told me.

The neighborhood is part of a larger contingent of 300 new homes to be attached to the Shiloh settlement.Mark C. Toner, Deputy Department Spokesperson, slammed the Jewish construction approval in a harshly worded statement that invoked Peres, a staunch supporter of the so-called two-state solution and the creation of a Palestinian state.The statement reads:""We strongly condemn the Israeli government's recent decision to advance a plan that would create a significant new settlement deep in the West Bank.""Proceeding with this new settlement, which could include up to 300 units, would further damage the prospects for a two state solution. The retroactive authorization of nearby illegal outposts, or redrawing of local settlement boundaries, does not change the fact that this approval contradicts previous public statements by the Government of Israel that it had no intention of creating new settlements. And this settlement's location deep in the West Bank, far closer to Jordan than Israel, would link a string of outposts that effectively divide the West Bank and make the possibility of a viable Palestinian state more remote.""It is deeply troubling, in the wake of Israel and the U.S. concluding an unprecedented agreement on military assistance designed to further strengthen Israel's security, that Israel would take a decision so contrary to its long term security interest in a peaceful resolution of its conflict with the Palestinians. Furthermore, it is disheartening that while Israel and the world mourned the passing of President Shimon Peres, and leaders from the U.S. and other nations prepared to honor one of the great champions of peace, plans were advanced that would seriously undermine the prospects for the two state solution that he so passionately supported.""Here, the State Department may be wrongly using Peres's name and legacy. Peres was an architect of the Oslo Accords, a land-for-peace process aimed at giving the Palestinians autonomy and eventually a state. But Peres did not argue for the complete dismantlement of the entire settlement enterprise or the evacuation of every Jewish community from the West Bank.  Indeed, he was an early supporter of the settlement process.Peres's Oslo Accords called for a process to achieve a treaty based on United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, the only binding resolution pertaining to the West Bank. That document calls on Israel to withdraw under a future final-status solution ""from territories occupied"" as a result of the 1967 Six Day War.  The resolution does not call for a withdrawal from ""all territories,"" a designation deliberately left out to ensure Israel's allowance under a future deal to retain some territory for security purposes.The Jewish Virtual Library explains:The Security Council did not say Israel must withdraw from ""all the"" territories occupied after the Six-Day war. This was quite deliberate. The Soviet delegate wanted the inclusion of those words and said that their exclusion meant ""that part of these territories can remain in Israeli hands."" The Arab states pushed for the word ""all"" to be included, but this was rejected. They nevertheless asserted that they would read the resolution as if it included the word ""all."" The British Ambassador who drafted the approved resolution, Lord Caradon, declared after the vote: ""It is only the resolution that will bind us, and we regard its wording as clear.""The Palestinian Authority and much of the international community says Israel is occupying the so-called pre-1967 borders, meaning the Gaza Strip, West Bank, and eastern Jerusalem, including the Temple Mount. Israel refers to the pre-1967 territories as disputed.The Obama administration routinely complains about Jewish construction in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem but it has been silent on rampant illegal Palestinian construction on Jewish-owned property in eastern sections of Jerusalem. This includes the construction of dozens of apartment buildings on about 270 acres in the Jerusalem neighborhoods of Qalandiya and Kfar Akev and about 50 acres in a north Jerusalem suburb known as Shoafat. The land is undisputedly owned by a U.S.-based Jewish group.Shiloh, meanwhile, is the ancient Samarian city mentioned in the Torah as the resting place of the Tabernacle. The Book of Joshua also relates: ""The whole congregation of Israel assembled together at Shiloh and set up the tent (or tabernacle) of the congregation there.""Aaron Klein is Breitbart's Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter. He is a New York Times bestselling author and hosts the popular weekend talk radio program, ""Aaron Klein Investigative Radio."" Follow him on Twitter @AaronKleinShow. Follow him on Facebook.""We strongly condemn the Israeli government's recent decision to advance a plan that would create a significant new settlement deep in the West Bank.
""Proceeding with this new settlement, which could include up to 300 units, would further damage the prospects for a two state solution. The retroactive authorization of nearby illegal outposts, or redrawing of local settlement boundaries, does not change the fact that this approval contradicts previous public statements by the Government of Israel that it had no intention of creating new settlements. And this settlement's location deep in the West Bank, far closer to Jordan than Israel, would link a string of outposts that effectively divide the West Bank and make the possibility of a viable Palestinian state more remote.
""It is deeply troubling, in the wake of Israel and the U.S. concluding an unprecedented agreement on military assistance designed to further strengthen Israel's security, that Israel would take a decision so contrary to its long term security interest in a peaceful resolution of its conflict with the Palestinians. Furthermore, it is disheartening that while Israel and the world mourned the passing of President Shimon Peres, and leaders from the U.S. and other nations prepared to honor one of the great champions of peace, plans were advanced that would seriously undermine the prospects for the two state solution that he so passionately supported.""var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([""embed""]);The Security Council did not say Israel must withdraw from ""all the"" territories occupied after the Six-Day war.

Mike Pence, the 2016 GOP vice presidential nominee, told Breitbart News exclusively that there is a ""contrast"" between GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump's solutions-focused campaign and Democratic nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton's negative campaign. SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERHere on his campaign bus after a rally with hundreds of supporters after he defeated his counterpart Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), Pence framed the election as a stark choice between someone who offers real change in Trump and Clinton--a protector of the status quo who is running a ""real insult-driven campaign."" Pence told Breitbart News:Donald Trump has given voice to the frustrations and aspirations of the American people like no leader in my lifetime since Ronald Reagan. He's cast a vision to Make America Great Again. From the days of the primary through our convention and every day since, he's been outlining the details and policies that will restore American strength at home and abroad, uphold our Constitution, promote the kind of trade policies that will put the American worker first, end illegal immigration. He's laid out the details of those policies. And the contrast with the real insult-driven campaign of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine could not be more dramatic. Their campaign every day seems to be intent on calling a press conference and focusing on what Donald Trump said or Tweeted in the last days or weeks or in some cases years. But the reason why you saw the crowd here in Virginia, the reason why you see the enormous crowds that are coming out for Donald Trump, is because by articulating a vision and laying forth the policies for how we Make America Great Again, Donald Trump has inspired a movement in this country and I think it's going to carry him all the way to the White House.Pence added that, as that vision Trump has laid out for the country comes more and more into focus, it will propel him to the White House.""I couldn't have been more honored to be on that stage and sharing Donald Trump's vision to Make America Great Again,"" Pence told Breitbart News. ""I know there's a lot of talk about who won the debate, some people think we won the debate, but I think Donald Trump won the debate. I think Donald Trump's vision to Make America Great Again won the debate. As you saw the enthusiasm here in Virginia today, I think that vision is going to continue to win between now and election day--and we're going to elect Donald Trump the 45th president of the United States.""The interview with Breitbart News, Pence's first since winning the debate, also focused on Kaine's inaccurate claim that Clinton apologized for her accusation that millions of Americans who support Trump for president were ""irredeemable people"" who are in the ""basket of deplorables."" Pence, too, touched on how Clinton was caught on just-released audio tape bashing supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders.During the debate on Tuesday evening in Farmville, Virginia, Kaine falsely claimed that Clinton apologized to the millions of Americans she insulted by making those remarks. Clinton never apologized for them at all. With regard to the remarks about Trump supporters, she only said she didn't mean ""half"" of them. Regarding the Sanders supporters, she never apologized at all. Asked about Kaine's comments on the matter during the debate, Pence said his false claim that she apologized for insulting the American electorate was ""remarkable.""Pence went on to tell Breitbart News:I'll tell you on that one, it really was remarkable to me that after Sen. Kaine listed one personal insult against Donald Trump after another--then he accused us of running an 'insult-driven campaign,' just--it was remarkable to me. It was also remarkable because Hillary Clinton called millions of Americans who think we can Make America Great Again, who think we can stand tall on the world stage again, who think we can rebuild our military, revive our economy, stand by our Constitution--Hillary Clinton said millions of Americans who believe in Donald Trump's vision for our country are in a 'basket of deplorables.' She said they are irredeemable. She said that they are not America. And despite what Sen. Kaine said last night, she never apologized for that--she just said she shouldn't have said 'half.' So, you know, all she did was say she got the number wrong. But I think people across the country got the message. I expect Bernie Sanders supporters got the message earlier this week when it came to light in February that Hillary Clinton had referred to Bernie Sanders supporters as 'children of the Great Recession' who had moved into their parents' basements.Pence said that Clinton's comments about Trump supporters and Sanders supporters disqualify her from being able to serve as president.""I mean, you cannot lead people you loathe,"" Pence said. ""Hillary Clinton's statements demeaning millions of Americans, including Bernie Sanders supporters, I believe disqualifies her to lead this nation as president. What I can tell you about Donald Trump is, whether you agree or you disagree with him, he is a man who respects the right of every American to make their choice in this election and to hold the views that they hold, and I couldn't be more honored to stand with him.""Ultimately speaking, when asked why the establishment media refuses to cover the movement of millions of people across the country coming out to Trump rallies and getting involved in the campaign nationwide, Pence said: ""You'd have to ask them. I really don't know.""But he said that movement of people from all walks of life is exactly why he's been so inspired as Trump's running mate.""It's been one of the things that's been most inspiring to me,"" Pence said. ""To campaign with Donald Trump, and to campaign for Donald Trump, is to literally see a movement of the American people. Donald Trump has articulated a vision for this country that is resonating with Americans from every walk of life. They are coming out, as they did here in Virginia today, in the middle of the week--in the middle of the afternoon--to get behind this man, and as he would be the first to say, to get behind a movement to Make America Great Again. I couldn't be more excited about the days that remain in this campaign, and we're just going to work our hearts out.""

He carried small signs with supposed white supremacist slogans on them, and was quickly surrounded by members of the media excited to report on the incident.Neo Nazi at Trump rally pic.twitter.com/4TeOg5PpDp-- Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) October 6, 2016However, David Martosko of the Daily Mail was skeptical, noting that the man had behaved in a ""suspicious"" manner:-- David Martosko (@dmartosko) October 6, 2016""Pepe"" (sic) is likely a reference to Pepe the Frog, the ""alt-right"" meme that has been classified as a ""hate symbol"" by the ADL.
@joelpollak I'm suspicious of this person. He seemed to want to be spotted and played to the cameras.-- David Martosko (@dmartosko) October 6, 2016
I fully expected 50+ reporters to swarm around the neo-Nazi tonight. It's what many of them are looking for.-- David Martosko (@dmartosko) October 6, 2016The man reportedly began spouting racist rhetoric and told reporters he was fine with Ivanka Trump being Jewish, but then insisted Hitler's Nazis did not kill six million Jews during the Holocaust in World War Two, according to reports.This man claimed to be a 25-year-old from Sacramento. Said he's okay w/ Ivanka being Jewish but refused to believe Nazis killed 6 million https://t.co/OKZQ2NXJzh-- Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) October 6, 2016Several reporters present during the interruption noted that the man was shouted down and harried by Trump's supporters to leave the rally.The gratifying thing, and I'd say this no matter who the candidate was, is that Trump's supporters shouted the Nazi down and humiliated him.-- David Martosko (@dmartosko) October 6, 2016He was shouted down by Trump supporters after and was escorted out. https://t.co/nUcpOsICA6-- Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) October 6, 2016""You're not speaking the truth for us!"" A Trump supporter shouts down alt-right man in Reno. pic.twitter.com/67Y5O1wDzI-- Ali Vitali (@alivitali) October 6, 2016It is unclear at this time if the man is connected to any neo-Nazi groups. He wore a ""State of Jefferson"" t-shirt, referring to a movement among several northern California counties to secede from the state. However, that movement has not been connected to extremism. One of its members, who was present at the Trump rally, told CNN: ""We do not support that garbage at all.""CNN reported that the man himself had ""confirmed"" that he was a ""neo-Nazi."" However, suspected left-wing plants and provocateurs have been spotted in recent years at Tea Party events and, lately, at Trump rallies.Last month, outside a rally in Asheville, North Carolina, a woman wearing an oxygen mask and protesting against Trump claimed she had been punched in the jaw by a Trump supporter. As Breitbart News reported, video of the altercation makes clear that the woman pursued the Trump supporter (in spite of her oxygen mask) and likely touched him first before the man, who has poor vision due to cataracts, turned around. He may have knocked her down by accident; his attorney told Breitbart News he was innocent and was considering a defamation lawsuit against the woman. She showed no visible signs of injury.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.
