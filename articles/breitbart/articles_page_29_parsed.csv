However, the information has not been confirmed by Israeli officials.""Marcelo Crivella, who has been to Israel nearly 35 times, is a great friend of the Jewish community and the State of Israel,"" Israel's Rio-based honorary consul Osias Wurman, a former president of Rio's Jewish federation, told JTA. ""I hope he will strengthen a lot of the cooperation between Rio and the State of Israel, in particular in the areas of security, culture and technology.""Brazil's most influential weekly magazine reported Monday that the Jewish vote from one of Rio's wealthiest neighborhoods was key in electing Crivella. The massive support could have been a reaction to Crivella's opponent's party members, who recently referred to the late Israeli President Shimon Peres as an ""ideologue of terrorism"" and, a year ago, burned the Israeli flag in public.Read more here.SIGN UP"	['Israel']	[]

He attended the conference in his capacity as chairman of the UN Legal Committee, a position he was elected to in June.The visit was conducted under heavy secrecy and tight security, so as not to arouse the anger of UAE citizens.UAE does not officially recognize Israel, so Israelis cannot obtain passports to travel there.

Jihadists have mounted attacks in Lebanon targeting Shi'ite areas and the army.Underscoring Hezbollah's continued mistrust of Hariri, who remains critical of its role in Syria, the group did not name him as prime minister, though it is expected to take part in his cabinet.SUPPORT FROM BERRIParliament Speaker Nabih Berri, head of the Shi'ite Amal movement and a close Hezbollah ally, had come out in opposition to the deal struck by Hariri and Aoun, voicing objections that had threatened to obstruct the formation of the new government.But announcing his decision to endorse Hariri for prime minister on Thursday, Berri indicated he would cooperate in efforts to set up the new administration. ""If there was no intention to cooperate, we would not have named him,"" he said.Hezbollah's parliamentary group, the Loyalty and Resistance Bloc, said in a statement that the presidential election had been a ""big victory for Lebanon"" and it hoped a national unity government would be formed as soon as possible.The statement thanked outgoing Prime Minister Tammam Salam, but did not mention Hariri by name.Hariri took on the political mantle of his father, Rafik al-Hariri, after his assassination in 2005. A UN-backed tribunal has charged five members of Hezbollah over the killing. The group denies any role.After his father's assassination, Hariri led a coalition of Lebanese parties through years of political conflict with Hezbollah and its allies, including Aoun. He was prime minister of a unity government from 2009 to 2011.Hezbollah and its allies brought down that government by resigning while he was in Washington meeting the US president.Hariri's concession has also been seen as a result of financial troubles at his Saudi-based construction firm Saudi Oger, which hit his political standing in Lebanon by causing to a sharp decline in funding for his political network.In Lebanon's sectarian power-sharing system, the post of prime minister is reserved for a Sunni Muslim, the president must be a Maronite Christian, and the parliament speaker must be a Shi'ite Muslim.The Lebanese must now agree on how to parcel out government portfolios. The post of energy minister is seen as one of the hardest to agree on. Lebanon has offshore oil and gas resources that have been left unexploited due to political conflict.SIGN UP"	[]	[]

Recent photos of the presidential plane show the special cell containing the device attached to the belly of the plane, the back and behind the wings. Israeli airline El Al has already been equipped with the system.Defens'Aero, a French blog specializing in aviation, noticed the newly installed system after seeing photographs of the plane two weeks ago in Bordeaux.According to French news agency AFP, an anonymous French security official confirmed the system.The system consists of smart thermal cameras that identify an incoming missile and targets the missile with a laser beam. The specialized beam interferes with the missile's targeting system, deflecting it off its trajectory and allowing it to explode at a safe distance from the plane.Read more here.SIGN UP	[]	[]

5	5	http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/11/04/brexit-shakespeare-dead-right-lawyers/	Brexit: Shakespeare Was Dead Right About Lawyers…	"""Kill all the lawyers.""SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER This has got to be my favourite line from Shakespeare - especially after the British High Court's decision on the EU Referendum whereby a trio of left-leaning activist judges were able to overturn the democratic will of 17.4 million people by ruling: ""No. That thing you all voted for. You can't have it because obscure technical detail...""Some cynics saw this coming a mile off, among them the redoubtable Peter Hitchens.'Before the referendum he correctly predicted what he now calls ""the greatest constitutional crisis since the Abdication of Edward VIII.""If - as I think we will - we vote to leave the EU on June 23, a democratically elected Parliament, which wants to stay, will confront a force as great as itself - a national vote, equally democratic, which wants to quit. Are we about to find out what actually happens when an irresistible force meets an immovable object?'I'm not as pessimistic as Peter Hitchens, partly because no one ever could be, and partly because I don't want to give succour to the enemy.Face it, we Brexiteers have enjoyed more than four deliriously happy months bathing in bitter Remainer tears, feeding on their sorrow like misery-sucking vampires, relishing every moment of their denials, their tantrums, their toys-cast-from-prams. So it's only natural that with the roles temporarily reversed, the Remaintards should seize their brief moment in the sun and begin crowing as if somehow those three lefty ponces in ermine (or whatever it is that left-wing High Court Judges wear: thongs? Gimp suits?) were now going to stop us exiting the EU.What's very important, though, in these circumstances is for us not to show we're upset, like the Remaintards have been doing since June 24. As I delicately put it on Twitter yesterday, they're already beating themselves off pretty frenziedly as it is - and the very last thing we should do is give them any more masturbatory material.Anyway, I interrupted myself: the real purpose of this piece was to use a topical news item about Brexit as an excuse to reiterate how much I loathe and detest lawyers.Some of them, it's true, are my best friends - but that's pretty inevitable if you're university educated: of course lots of your contemporaries will inevitably have gone to the dark side. But doesn't mean that I don't view their profession in much the way I view the giant orange slugs that destroy my vegetable patch or the evil squirrels which insinuate their way into my fruit cage and eat my strawberries or the fungal infections I sometimes get between my toes or the swollen mite with a mauve body and purple legs I once found clinging to my left testicle in a bucket shower in the Western Sudan in 1984. And at least with a bit of soap and gentle easing I got rid of the mite; at least I can squash the slugs and decapitate the squirrels in my squirrel trap. Lawyers on the other hand just won't go away...Which is as good a way as any of introducing my latest Breitbart podcast with this week's guest Gary Bell.He is - you might have guessed - a lawyer. But I fear, try as you might not to, that you're probably going to like him. He's fat, rude, cocky but he's funny and quick on his feet and razor sharp, as you need to be when you're one of Britain's top criminal barristers.One of the things that's interesting about him is that he used to be a criminal himself. In his misspent youth, he narrowly escaped a prison sentence for slot machine fraud. Also, he used to be a football hooligan with the nickname Animal. (Hence the title of his very readable autobiography which is absolutely begging to be made into a film, probably starring the late John Candy as Gary - Animal QC)Another reason why you shouldn't hate him is that Gary is one of the very few people at the bar who is not a liberal-lefty tosser. He definitely voted Brexit and, if he weren't so infuriatingly career-safe when there's a recording device in front of him I expect he'd have some trenchant, possibly even Shakespearean words to say about those three activist judges in their ermine gimp suits who think that their wanky and probably erroneous understanding of Constitutional law should take precedence over the will of 17.4 million British subjects...If - as I think we will - we vote to leave the EU on June 23, a democratically elected Parliament, which wants to stay, will confront a force as great as itself - a national vote, equally democratic, which wants to quit. Are we about to find out what actually happens when an irresistible force meets an immovable object?'SIGN UP"	[]	[]

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSo Breitbart News is providing a guide to the 10 states most likely to give Trump his 270th Electoral Vote, and the keys to the Oval Office. Winning any of those 10 states is enough to give Trump the White House, according to Silver's graph as of 6 p.m. Thursday, if Trump doesn't lose any of the various states which Silver believes will support Trump. That list of pro-Trump states includes three states where Trump has a tiny or narrow edge, according to Silver. Those three states are Nevada, North Carolina and Florida.The current polling shows that Trump has the momentum, his TV commercials are new, and they  are reaching voters who normally watch only some combination of CNN, MSNBC, sports or the big networks. Clinton was clearly caught off guard by the Trump surge and did not have attack commercials produced - so she has had to resort to rerunning dated attack commercials which traditionally have diminishing returns. Trump also benefits by early voting indicators that black turnout is dropping off from the historic highs. If North Carolina's low-turnout numbers translate into lower black turnout, Trump could perform almost three points better than Gov. Mitt Romney's overall percentage in 2012. Finally, Trump hopes for the silent vote summed up by a Virginia sign stating, ""Vote Trump - Nobody Ever Has to Know.""Clinton's advantages include the incredible targeted lists and huge ground game advantage, as well as the fact that so far she seems to only temporarily drop into a tie vote after a round of terrible news cycles and then she rebounds to a lead within a few days. Democrats misunderstand how big that advantage is however. Democrat turnout operations can only be successful with a mass infrastructure because urban-based voters often need transportation to the polls. Most Republicans drive themselves to the polls, and do not accept rides to the polls, so GOP consultants have long joked that party's get-out-the-vote program was called ""television."" This time, the massive digital effort by Trump's data guru, Brad Parscale, could become an effective turnout tool. SIGN UPDonald Trump is just one state short of the presidency, according to the 6 pm Thursday evening projection by Nate Silver, the left's favorite polling prognosticator. So Breitbart News is providing a guide to the 10 states most likely to give Trump his 270th Electoral Vote, and the keys to the Oval Office. New Hampshire - While Silver says Clinton is the slight favorite in this state, Trump leads or is tied in all three polls released in the first three days of November, including the ,  and .Colorado - The Denver Post is the only poll showing Trump tied with Clinton -- but he is within six points or less in every other recent poll. RealClearPolitics showed Trump improving from eight points down to just three, which is one of his biggest gains.Pennsylvania - Gravis is the only Pennsylvania poll in which Trump is within a point, but Trump's improvement in the RealClearPolitics average from a double-digit deficit in late August, to 8.3 point deficit October 15, and then to the current 3 point deficit gives supporters hope.Michigan - The only poll in the past week was a Nov. 2 Fox 2 Detroit tracking poll which showed Trump pulling within three points, a big improvement over the previous polls released October 25 and 26 both showed a 7-point Clinton lead. On Nov. 3, the Fox 2 Detroit updated tracking poll showed him staying just three points behind. A Oct. 29 to Oct. 30 poll of 500 likely voters by a GOP polling firm put Trump just one point behind Clinton. Wisconsin - All recent polls, including the ""gold standard"" Marquette Law School poll, show Trump pulling to within four to six points. The fact that Sen. Ron Johnson has pulled back to within a single point in the Marquette poll, and that Wisconsin is the home state of Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, do ensure a huge local turnout effort. In addition, the voter identification law in Wisconsin is probably the best voter integrity system in the country. Virginia - While no longer down by double digits, all four polls released October 30 showed Trump still four to six points behind - with Emerson showing a 4-point Clinton lead in the increasingly diverse state.  Minnesota - The two last October polls posted by the Star-Tribune showed Clinton with an 8-point lead and a 10-point lead, so Trump's partisans are hoping there's a huge bloc of silent supporters. They are pointing to Trump's stunning win among the first true statewide poll of high school students as evidence of this hidden support.New Mexico - While Silver considers this quite a long shot, the only poll run in the last month gave Clinton just a 5-point lead, and that was before her numbers dropped as the FBI reopened its investigation of her email network. Oregon - The most recent poll  was released Nov. 1, by Fox 12 showing a 7-point lead for Clinton, and the other polls also show similar leads for Clinton. ew Jersey - The four polls run since Labor Day range from a 4-point to 24-point margin for Clinton - with the only October poll (Fairleigh Dickinson) being in between those at 11 points. Only the wild inconsistency of those polls gives any hope of a shocker here, which is most likely to be a double-digit Clinton win.Winning any of those 10 states is enough to give Trump the White House, according to Silver's graph as of 6 p.m. Thursday, if Trump doesn't lose any of the various states which Silver believes will support Trump. That list of pro-Trump states includes three states where Trump has a tiny or narrow edge, according to Silver. Those three states are Nevada, North Carolina and Florida.The current polling shows that Trump has the momentum, his TV commercials are new, and they  are reaching voters who normally watch only some combination of CNN, MSNBC, sports or the big networks.

IG Investigate Clinton-Podesta-Kadzik-McAuliffe Conflicts of Interest	"The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a letter to the Department of Justice Inspector General Wednesday requesting that his office investigate multiple instances of serious breaches of professional ethics and potential violations of law at this department.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""It is vital that the American people have confidence in the ability of the Department to be impartial with regard to criminal inquiries related to senior officials and candidates for high office,"" wrote Sen. Charles Grassley (R.-Iowa), whose committe has direct oversight of the Department of Justice. ""Yet, the Justice Department has failed to appoint a special counsel to ensure that these inquiries are insulated from the appearance that decisions are being made based on political considerations rather than on the merits.""The chairman attached two previous letters to highlight his long-running concerns with the attorney general: ""Attached please find two previous letters that I sent to the FBI relating to Attorney General Lynch's potential conflicts and the FBI's second in command, Andrew McCabe and his potential conflicts related to Clinton fundraiser, Gov. Terry McAuliffe.  Additionally recent reports have also illustrated long running, close ties between Peter Kadzik and the Clinton's inner circle.""Kadzik is a friend of John Podesta, the chairman of the Hillary R. Clinton presidential campaign, and the Wikileaks posts have exposed the depth of that friendship as Kadsik, from his senior perch inside the State Department, regularly passed internal information to Podesta, especially when dealing with how the department was managing the disclosure of Clinton's emails from her tenure as secretary of state.One of the most illustrative emails posted by WikiLeaks shows that Kadzik is a true agent provocateur on behalf of the Clinton campaign:From: *Peter Kadzik* <peterkadzik@gmail.com>

indicates it will be awhile (2016) before the State Department posts the

Horowitz, the State Department's inspector general, with his own catalog:As the senior official in the Office of Legislative Affairs, Mr. Kadzik is being allowed to participate in decisions about what information on these matters will be disclosed to Congressional oversight committees.  Reports have noted that Mr. Kadzik continues a very close relationship with John Podesta, the Chairman of Secretary Clinton's presidential campaign.

On this point, the House Committee on Government Reform found that Mr. Kadzik was hired by Marc Rich because of his connections with Mr. Podesta.*    Mr. Podesta emailed Obama campaign officials to recommend Mr. Kadzik for a role in the Obama campaign and called Mr. Kadzik a ""fantastic lawyer"" that ""kept me out of jail.""*    Mr. Kadzik met with Mr. Podesta for dinner one day after Secretary Clinton's Benghazi testimony.

Terry McAuliffe for her political campaign.  Given Gov. McAuliffe's ties to the Clintons and the control Mr. McCabe later exerted over the Clinton investigation, some have suggested that there is at least the appearance of a conflict.  All government employees must avoid situations that create the appearance of impropriety.  Specifically, 5 C.F.R. SS 2635.502, advises that a government employee should seek clearance before participating in any matter that could cause his or her impartiality to be questioned.The chairman must have wondered where it all ends, when he wrote: ""Against the backdrop of these apparent conflicts, the public has also learned that the Justice Department entered into unusual immunity agreements with all of Secretary Clinton's close associates.  These immunity agreements inexplicably limited the scope in which the FBI could review relevant emails.""Typically, the Justice Department trades immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony and or information that leads to someone's prosecution and conviction.In the case of the Clinton private email scandal, there were plenty of immunity deals, but no prosecution, especially after the FBI decided to put guard rails on its probe, focusing on the Espionage Act and ignoring all other possible violations of the law.""In addition, the public now knows that the investigation's scope was arbitrarily limited to classifications issues, with little or no effort to make a case against anyone for intentionally alienating federal records to subvert the Freedom of Information Act process and potentially obstruct Congress,"" said Grassley.""In light of all of this, an independent, objective, non-partisan review is vital.  The American people deserve to know whether political considerations have improperly affected the handling of this inquiry and understand why key officials failed to recuse themselves to protect the public's confidence in a fair and impartial inquiry based on merits and the evidence rather than on politics,"" the senator said.The senator, who is considered Capitol Hill's top guardian angel of government whistle blowers, requested a response by Nov. 7.From: *Peter Kadzik* <peterkadzik@gmail.com>

Breitbart News has long warned that the expansion of background checks is a tool that governments -- whether state or federal -- can use to find guns for which no paper trail currently exists. And Maine's Question 3 is a perfect illustration of the validity of such warnings.According to the Portland Press Herald, ""The debate over Question 3 is increasingly focused on language that would require background checks before Mainers could loan guns to each other, an issue that has allowed opponents to rally hunters and other gun owners against the ballot measure."" Moreover, the background check that would be required for loaning a gun to a friend carries a fee. In other words, you not only help create a paper trail for the shotgun your grandfather gave you before he passed away but also pay for the services that create such a trail.Once these aspects of the initiative were uncovered, support for Question 3 dropped from ""61 percent"" in early October to barely over 50 percent by mid-to-late October, and there is no reason to doubt that support has continued to wane. At the same time, polls show that determined opposition to Question 3 has made a sharp increase.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of ""Bullets with AWR Hawkins,"" a Breitbart News podcast.

John Sununu, is described as ""not a stereotypical Republican"" and has promised to go separate ways with his pro-life party to ""expand women's health.""As WMUR reports, Sununu, who is trying to appeal to more women and Democrats, also says, ""The fact is, I took on my own party to expand women's health, and I fought for more choices for our families.""""Chris Sununu has reiterated his support of funding Planned Parenthood and has taken a dangerous stand in direct opposition to a large part of his base just days before the election,"" says Rico McCahon, executive director of Cornerstone Action, in a statement to Breitbart News.McCahon adds:Taking a page from the liberal playbook, he debases the entire idea of ""women's health"" by reducing it to taxpayer funding of abortion providers. Cornerstone believes that the health of women and their families is far too important to be reduced to the political talking point of an abortion provider and its beholden politicians. New Hampshire women deserve better, life-affirming care.In June, Sununu surprised fellow Republicans when he voted with Democrats to approve $549,000 in funding to Planned Parenthood.In a statement on his Facebook page, Sununu said:Today's vote will provide $549,000 in funding for important health services for nearly 12,000 New Hampshire women and families, including cancer screenings and STI testing and treatment.Last Year, I voted against this contract after hearing concerns from my constituents regarding the legality of practices Planned Parenthood had allegedly engaged in. I stand by my principle that this state should not conduct business with groups under any investigation or that are embroiled in serious controversy. As has been widely reported, charges against Planned Parenthood for these alleged practices were dismissed by court order. As this group is no longer under investigation, they should be treated like any other organization that comes before the Council.Following his statement, Susan B. Anthony List president Marjorie Dannenfelser said, ""Shame on the Council for funneling more taxpayer dollars to Planned Parenthood, and shame on Councilor and GOP gubernatorial candidate Chris Sununu for going back on his vote.""Dannenfelser continued:Chris Sununu watched the shocking videos of Planned Parenthood employees discussing the harvesting of babies' hearts, kidneys, brains, and livers for money, and rightly voted to withhold funding a year ago. The only thing that's changed since then is mounting evidence uncovered by the U.S. House's ongoing Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives showing Planned Parenthood's collusion with organ buyers and illegal profits.  Far from being cleared of any wrongdoing, the evidence is mounting against Planned Parenthood. Taxpayers should have no part in supporting a brutal industry that puts a price tag on mothers and their children.Ironically, Sununu's campaign website states he is ""opposing Obamacare regulations."" However, one of the health care law's most controversial ""regulations"" is the contraceptive mandate, which forces most employers to provide free birth control, abortion-inducing drugs, and sterilization to employees through health insurance plans. Planned Parenthood is one of the most ardent supporters of that regulation.The New Hampshire affiliate of the nation's largest abortion business, however, is supporting Democrat Colin Van Ostern for governor.50k #NH residents depend on Medicaid Expansion & 12k rely @ppnnehealth for their health care. @ColinVanOstern will protect both. #nhpolitics-- Planned Parenthood (@PPNHAF) November 1, 2016REAL TALK: b/c of @ChrisSununu @ppnnehealth was defunded for 10 mos.

Mike Pence, and in support of the Trump-Pence ticket, where he narrowed down the election to three issues: ""namely jobs, freedom, and security.""SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSpeaking at the Air Zoo Aerospace & Science Center, Cruz said, ""This election is about bringing jobs back to America"" adding, ""We need to repeal every word of Obamacare."" The crowd went wild and chanted, ""Drain the swamp! Drain the swamp!""Cruz responded in jest, ""Now listen: Hillary Clinton is very upset. That's her home you're draining."" Cruz had performed well in Michigan during the Republican primary campaign.Also taking a swipe at the teetering Affordable Care Act, following Cruz's talk Pence said, ""Before we called it Obamacare, they called it Hillarycare."" He added, ""We are going to replace it with healthcare reform that gives American people more choices, so they can use the power of the free market to feed the healthcare needs of an American economy.""Cruz stumped with Pence earlier that same morning in Prole, Iowa where he also cited the importance of upholding and preserving the U.S. Constitution. Cruz guaranteed the crowd that a Clinton presidency would destroy the document's principles by naming a liberal Supreme Court Justice to the seat that was vacated with the passing of Justice Antonin Scalia.Cruz said Clinton's SCOTUS pick would overturn the landmark 2008 District of Columbia vs. Heller ruling, which protects the 2nd Amendment. ""If Hillary were to be elected and Heller were overturned, that means no one in Michigan, no one here tonight, no one in America has the right to bear and keep arms."" Cruz later went on to say, ""That is radical, that is extreme, and this election is about our freedom.""Cruz described Pence as ""someone who understands the value of freedom and understands the value of the Supreme Court. He's a good man, he loves his country and today, I call him my friend. But I am looking forward to calling him Mr. Vice President,"" Cruz added.""I'm a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican,"" Pence said. He apologized for being a bit tardy to the rally, as they had stopped for lunch and joked that ""Senator Tim Kaine called and interrupted me 10 times,"" referring to the Democrat vice presidential debate.Pence said that while Clinton may have the media, millions of dollars, and special interests on her side, ""Donald Trump and I have something special. We have a basket of Americans who are saying enough is enough. And we are going to make America great again.""A man in the crowd shouted out, ""Bill's a rapist!""Pence went on to insist that in his and Trump's first 100 days in office they are going to pass ethics reform. ""We are going to drain the swamp,"" he said.Pence said the world is a more dangerous place today since Clinton and Obama took office, citing the ransom the Obama administration paid to the Iranian regime, which he described as a ""terrorist state,"" in exchange for American prisoners. Then the candidate blasted the president's ""weak and ineffective policy of leading from behind.""Pence said, ""When Donald Trump becomes president of the  Untied States, we wont be paying ransom.""Pence asked those gathered to pray for America and not to lose faith in the nation. He sent a message to Republicans that ""It's time to come home. it's time to come home and elect Donald Trump as President of the United States of America.""Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope @AdelleNaz

Pappert said the state GOP's request was ""unreasonably delayed,"" is not in the public interest, and does not qualify for last-minute interventions from the court, the Associated Press reported.""Any intervention at this point risks practical concerns including disruption, confusion or other unforeseen deleterious effects,"" Pappert wrote. ""Plaintiffs waited until eighteen days before the election to bring this case ... Were the Court to enter the requested injunction, poll watchers would be allowed to roam the Commonwealth on election day for the first time in the Election Code's seventy-nine year history -- giving the Commonwealth and county election officials all of five days' notice to prepare for the change.""Congressman Bob Brady, chairman of the Philadelphia Democratic Party, said he was pleased with the ruling.""We don't need out-of-county people,"" Brady said. ""They're just trying to suppress the vote and cause confusion. It's totally ridiculous.""The state GOP claimed that the current Pennsylvania law that allows poll-watchers to only monitor locations within the county they're registered to vote is unconstitutional, and it filed for a temporary restraining order Oct. 21.Pappert said the decision to intervene would cause an undue burden on election officials the night of the election and struck down an argument by the state GOP that said the law violates free speech.""To the extent that the Party wishes to allocate newly available poll watchers on election day, it will of course send them to Philadelphia,"" Pappert wrote. ""The poll watchers will all need to be properly credentialed in Philadelphia County and they will all seek those credentials between now and election day.""The content of a poll watcher's statements cannot be characterized as political speech,"" Pappert added.SIGN UP"	[]	[]

Trump has now taken a commanding lead in the latest surveys out of New Hampshire and North Carolina as his pathway to the White House grows by the hour in the final week.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAn ARG poll out of New Hampshire, conducted from Oct. 31 through Nov. 2, shows Trump with a comfortable five point lead in the Granite State--outside the survey's four percent margin of error. Trump, at 48 percent, leads Clinton who lags at 43 percent. Libertarian Gary Johnson got four percent and the Green Party's Dr. Jill Stein got one percent, while four percent were undecided. The poll surveyed 600 likely voters, and it's the third survey out of New Hampshire on Thursday showing Trump either leading or tied with Clinton.Down in North Carolina, the third survey in as many days shows Trump with a similarly strong lead. Trump's 5.9 percent lead--he's at 49.6 percent while Clinton trails down at 43.7 percent--is outside the latest Red Wolf Public Sector survey's 4.9 percent margin of error. That survey polled 375 likely voters in North Carolina, and tracks closely with other surveys out of the Tar Heel state suggesting Trump has moved ahead in the final week.Trump has seemingly locked in the red states, which amount to 191 electoral votes, and similarly has taken leads in Ohio, Iowa, Nevada, Florida, North Carolina, New Hampshire, and Maine's second congressional district. If he holds all these places in which he currently leads, he will hit exactly 270 electoral votes--and that's without even counting other states with close races like Virginia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Colorado, New Mexico, Wisconsin, or Minnesota.SIGN UP	['Wolf', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas) that Clinton was only pretending to oppose TPP in order to get union support but would sign it when she was president,"" write Trump advisers Peter Navarro and Curtis Ellis.The advisers write:Rep. Johnson, an early Clinton supporter, told constituents in her Dallas district that she speaks with Hillary Clinton several times a week, and the presidential nominee told her that the only reason she opposes TPP is to get 'labor off her back' and that once she is elected President she will reverse position. This fits with Hillary's earlier confession to bankers that she has a public position and a private position on every issue.""Donald Trump is the only candidate who opposes the TPP and will stop it,"" the advisers explain. ""If [Clinton is] elected, she will sign the Trans-Pacific Partnership into law. She said so herself,"" they write.Indeed, earlier this week, Obama's U.S. trade representative Michael Froman said that he believes Congress likely has the votes to pass TPP if Congressional leaders were to bring the deal up for a vote-even though polling data suggests that members of Congress, who vote for the deal, would be acting against the desires of the American electorate that opposes the multinational trade pact.If Clinton were to reverse her public position on the TPP, reports suggest she would likely receive support from Republican establishment lawmakers. As Washington Post has reported, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan would likely advance Clinton's globalist agenda on foreign trade. Ryan championed the effort to grant President Obama the executive authority to fast-track the TPP. In a 2015 Wall Street Journal op-ed, Ryan described the TPP as an ""historic"" agreement which ""would mean greater access to a billion customers for American manufacturers, farmers and ranchers.""In their memo, Trump's advisers note that ""this is not the first time the Clintons have pretended to oppose job-killing trade deals before an election then pushed them afterwards."" The advisers explain that her husband claimed to oppose NAFTA before he was elected President, and that Hillary Clinton claimed to oppose the then-pending Columbia and South Korea trade pacts before lobbying for them as Secretary of State.When Hillary announced her public opposition to TPP, she carefully hedged her words to leave the door open to support it down the road. Sen. Tim Kaine told ""Meet The Press"" a President-elect Hillary Clinton would, ""never close the door"" on a multinational Asian trade deal. Asked to disavow supporting a version of the TPP after the election, Kaine said ""We're not sure yet.""In 1992, Bill Clinton opposed NAFTA before the election. But after the election, he made cosmetic changes to the pact, declared it fixed, and pushed it through Congress.In her 2008 presidential run, Hillary said she opposed the then-pending free trade agreements with Colombia and South Korea declaring, ""I will do everything I can to urge the Congress to reject the Colombia Free Trade Agreement.""But as Secretary of State, Clinton personally lobbied members of Congress to support the Colombia deal, and she lobbied for the South Korea free trade agreement as well.In a 2015 interview with Nevada public television [11:29 mark], Hillary pointed to the South Korea trade deal as an example of how she would make superficial changes to the TPP and sign it. ""When President Obama came in and I came in, we're presented with this free trade agreement [with Korea] and we say it's not strong enough ... We can't go forward with it unless there are changes - that is the kind of negotiation I am proposing [with TPP].""After some superficial changes were made, Secretary Clinton helped push the Korea trade pact through Congress, promising it would create 70,000 jobs and boost exports. In reality, the trade deficit with Korea surged $15.4 billion (99 percent). The increase in the trade deficit with Korea cost more than 100,000 American jobs in the first four years of the free trade agreement. The surge of imports of auto parts and vehicles from Korea hit the auto industry particularly hard.The advisers note that ""the biggest victim in this latest Clinton bait and switch will be the millions of Americans whose jobs will be sent overseas. TPP will destroy what is left of an American manufacturing base that has been devastated over the past 15 years by three other bad Clinton trade deals: 1993's NAFTA, China's 2001 entry into the World Trade Organization, and the 2012 South Korea deal.""Rep.

Throughout the election, Flake has made clear that his opposition to Trump stems, in large part, from Flake's opposition to Trump's plans to secure the southern border, enforce U.S. immigration laws, curb Islamic migration, and enact trade deals that put the needs of the American worker first.Indeed, on some of the most significant policy issues facing the nation today, Flake sides with Clinton over Trump and the American electorate. Most notably, both Flake and Clinton are proponents of the open borders trade and immigration policies supported by globalist corporate donors. Both Clinton and Flake have been vocal advocates of the Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, as well as the Trans Pacific Partnership-although Clinton has since rhetorically distanced herself from her prior enthusiastic support for the 12-nation trade pact.""I won't lie, it's not been easy,"" [Flake] said, going on to paraphrase a John McCain joke that Congress' popularity is down to paid staffers and blood relatives.

Trump if he wins Tuesday to protect America from the threat of Islamic terrorism, said John Guandolo, who in 2007 was named a ""Defender of the Homeland"" by the Center for Security Policy, an award that was presented to him by Sen. Jon Kyl (R.-Texas) and Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D.-Conn.).
Call into the show: (877) 240-1776""One is to deal with immigration and Two is to rip the Islamic movement up from roots in the United States,"" said the former Marine officer, who lead a special operations team operating in the Balkans in the 1990s.Guandolo said he recommends a five-year freeze on Muslim immigration just to get a handle on the situation.There are already jihadists coming into the country in violation of the law, which is not being enforced, he said.Schilling told the former Marine officer and combat diver that the fear of being called racist or politically incorrect is enough for people to keep quiet about the dangerous things they see and hear, such as in the San Bernardino shootings, when the neighbors were too scared to tell someone what was about to go down.""This is a war of narratives that is actually getting people killed,"" he said.""That to me above all is the scary part,"" Schilling said.Guandolo said that our public officials know all  they need to know, but they too are afraid-and they should resign.As for the organizations supporting Islamic terrorism, the work is already done, all we need to do is go to court, he said.""We have legal cause right now and evidence-that we already have right now-that has already been gathered over the last 20 years by the FBI and is actually going back to the early 80s, to indict the most prominent Islamic organizations in the United States: The Islamic Society of North America; the Muslim Brotherhood's bank, The North American Islamic Trust,;the Hamas organization in the United States, CAIR, the Council of American Islamic Relations; the Muslim student organization, The Islamic Circle of North America, the Muslim Public Affairs Council-across the board, we could indict them today"" he said.Guandolo said in 2009, which was the first year of President Barack Obama's term, Attorney General Eric Holder Jr., refused to prosecute Omar Ahmad, the leader and founder of CAIR, for his role in supporting terrorist organizations in connection with the Holy Land Foundation case. ""Even though the Department of Justice and the FBI were working towards that.""In the seven years since Holder froze the case against Ahmad, none of the hundreds of named co-conspirators in that case have been pursued by DOJ, he said.The Holy Land Foundation was at the time of its November 2001 conviction the largest Islamic charity in the country and it was found guilty of sending more than $12 million to Hamas, he said.Holder and the DOJ abandoned the case, even after the government found in the bank records of The Islamic Society of North America money transfers directly to Hamas and its leaders, he said. Hamas is a Sunni-Muslim organization of Palestinians that set itself up as a more militant rival to the Palestinian Liberation Organization in opposition to the State of Israel.
