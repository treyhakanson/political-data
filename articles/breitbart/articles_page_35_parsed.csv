""Republicans now have returned 72,000 more ballots than Democrats to date.""""Of the total ballots cast in Florida today, Republicans continue to hold a slight lead...by a margin of 16,460,"" Carr touted.He described North Carolina as a state where Democrats will fall short. Republicans are turning out more in North Carolina than they did in 2012 for early votes, but Republicans trail Democrats by 234,000 ballots.In 2012, Republicans trailed Democrats by 307,000 ballots cast to date, but Romney still won.""Romney was still able to carry the state on election day,"" Carr noted about North Carolina. ""At this point, it looks like Democrats will fall significantly short of hitting that firewall.""The numbers detailed per state during the phone call with reporters reflect the number of registered voters per party, not the actual voting results.SIGN UP"	['Romney', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

Trump repeated that promise at two campaign rallies in Michigan on Monday, one in Grand Rapids, and a second later in the day in Warren, which is in Macomb County, a suburb of Detroit.Clinton, in contrast, has promised to increase the number of Syrian refugees annually by 550 percent, from the 10,000 originally proposed by the Obama administration for FY 2016 to 65,000 per year.The Obama administration ended up resettling 12,500 Syrian refugees in FY 2016 out of the total 85,000 resettled in the United States that year.Though Clinton has been careful to avoid further comment on the number of refugees that would be resettled under her administration, her ideological allies at Refugee Council USA, the lobbying arm for the politically powerful refugee resettlement industry, have proposed increasing the number of refugees resettled in the United States to 200,000 in FY 2017.As Breitbart News has reported previously, many critics of the federal refugee resettlement industry believe that if Clinton is elected president she will increase the number of refugees resettled in the United States to at least the 200,000 annual level proposed by Refugee Council USA.By more than a two to one margin, polls indicate that voters disagree with Hillary Clinton's plans to increase the number of Syrian refugees resettled in the United States annually to 65,000 and the Refugee Council USA's proposals to increase the total number of refugees resettled to 200,000 annually.In the most recent Breitbart/Gravis national poll, conducted between October 25 and October 26, 63 percent of voters said they disagreed with Hillary Clinton's position on increasing the number of refugees resettled in the United States, while 26 percent agreed with her position.Texas, which recently informed the Obama administration that it is withdrawing from the federal refugee resettlement program in January, received more refugees in October-1,097-than any other state.California (814), New York (554), Arizona (551), Michigan (550), Washington (498), Ohio (452), Georgia (365), Pennsylvania (335), and North Carolina (312) rounded out the top ten states for refugee resettlement in October.One thousand two hundred and ninety-seven Syrian refugees, 1,282 of whom were Muslim (98.8 percent), were among the 9,935 refugees resettled in the United States in October.Michigan was by far the top destination state for Syrian refugees, with 206 during October.California (140), Texas (89), Arizona (88), Pennsylvania (70), Florida (69), Ohio (65), Maryland (63), New York (60), and Georgia (59) rounded out the top ten states for Syrian refugee resettlement in OctoberCalifornia and Michigan were the top two states for Syrian refugee resettlement in FY 2016 as well, when 12,500 Syrian refugees were resettled in the United States.At the current monthly rate, more than 15,000 Syrian refugees will be resettled in the United States in FY 2017.Grassroots opposition to Syrian refugee resettlement in Michigan has increased significantly over the past several months.In September, L. Brooks Patterson, Oakland County, Michigan county executive, said he intends to sue the federal government over the resettlement of refugees, many of whom are Syrian, in the county on the grounds it has failed to comply with the consultation clause of the Refugee Act of 1980.In October, the trustees of Watership Township, also in Oakland County, unanimously passed a resolution stating that the township would not cooperate with the federal refugee resettlement program.During the first ten months of calendar year 2016, CNS News reports:The Obama administration has resettled 13,210 Syrian refugees into the United States since the beginning of 2016 - an increase of 675 percent over the same 10-month period in 2015.Of those, 13,100 (99.1 percent) are Muslims - 12,966 Sunnis, 24 Shi'a, and 110 other Muslims - and 77 (0.5 percent) are Christians. Another 24 (0.18 percent) are Yazidis.During the Jan.-Oct. period in 2015, 1,705 Syrian refugees were admitted, of whom 1,664 (97.5 percent) were Muslims and 29 (1.7 percent) were Christians.Meanwhile the surge of Syrian refugee admissions initiated by the administration last February has continued into the new fiscal year, now one month-old: A total of 1,297 were resettled during October - a 593 percent increase over the 187 admitted in October 2015.One thousand three hundred and fifty-two Somali refugees, 1,350 of whom were Muslim (99.8 percent) were among the 9,935 refugees resettled in the United States in October.As Breitbart News reported previously, Somali refugees have experienced high rates of active tuberculosis (TB) and caused public health concerns in states in which they have resettled, particularly in Minnesota, where at least 304 refugees have been diagnosed with active TB over the past six years.New York, with 138 Somali refugees resettled in October, and Minnesota, with 135 Somali refugees resettled in the month, were the top two destination states for Somali refugees in October.Ohio (93), Texas (90), Arizona (79), Washington (72), Kentucky (69), Missouri (49), Pennsylvania (45), and Michigan (43) rounded out the top ten states for Somali refugee resettlement in October. The Obama administration has resettled 13,210 Syrian refugees into the United States since the beginning of 2016 - an increase of 675 percent over the same 10-month period in 2015.
Of those, 13,100 (99.1 percent) are Muslims - 12,966 Sunnis, 24 Shi'a, and 110 other Muslims - and 77 (0.5 percent) are Christians. Another 24 (0.18 percent) are Yazidis.

It's a company called OpenDNS, they are a fairly reputable organization. The traffic seems to have cleared up at about 11:50pm. I wonder if they had someone launching an attack from their servers,"" Pagliano wrote.""That may explain the DNS issue we had earlier. Might have been an injection attack. We use their servers to resolve external websites for both the sbs and blackberry server so we'd be susceptible to such an attack,"" Pagliano wrote.As Breitbart News reported, Hillary Clinton admitted in a private paid speech that she was continuously hacked by the Russians and Chinese.

In short, just about everyone tied to Hillary Clinton is the subject of a serious investigation. Not all of them were are the beneficiaries of those curious preemptive immunity deals tossed around by FBI leadership, to the consternation of some agents.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER1. Clinton Email Scandal: As everyone knows, this supposedly de-railed investigation was dramatically hoisted back onto the rails by none other than Anthony Weiner - the accused pedophile who ended up with a huge trove of State Department emails on his computer, which the FBI seized because Weiner has been sending sexually explicit messages to a 15-year-old girl. Not only is the Clinton email investigation back on the rails, it's chugging along at high speed. It was reported on Monday that the FBI has ""accelerated its timeline"" for reviewing Weiner emails linked to Clinton.2. The Anthony Weiner Investigation: The poor judgment displayed by Hillary Clinton in allowing vital government emails to slip onto Anthony Weiner's computer is absolutely breathtaking.Furthermore, Clinton's top aide Huma Abedin has trotted out the shopworn all-purpose Obama administration excuse that she knew nothing about the situation until she heard it reported on the news. That should disqualify her from ever obtaining any sort of security clearance, if Hillary Clinton had not already rendered information security a joke.Both Abedin and Clinton could be in legal jeopardy, depending on what emails the FBI finds lurking in the diseased corners of Weiner's laptop. Weiner himself is absolutely in jeopardy, the kind that puts perverts in jail for long stretches of time. He has every reason to make a deal with law enforcement. He might have a lot to deal with. How did 650,000 State Department emails end up on his computer? The simplest explanation might be that Carlos Danger (as he once liked to be called) was stockpiling leverage to use against his now-estranged wife and her boss, The Smartest Woman Who Ever Lived.3. The Clinton Foundation Probe: We've learned an FBI probe of the Clinton Foundation for possible financial crimes and influence peddling has been in progress for over a year. As the Wall Street Journal put it, some of the investigators were ""frustrated"" because FBI leadership seemed ""uninterested in probing the charity.""This is an investigation that could rope in a lot of people in Clinton's inner circle, besides Hillary and Bill Clinton themselves. Abedin is a player, and so is Hillary Clinton's chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, and another key aide, Philippe Reines. Bill Clinton's old ""body man"" Doug Band - basically the Littlefinger of Bill Clinton's financial empire, for you Game of Thrones fans - and even Chelsea Clinton could end up answering some tough questions.  Much will depend on whether the Clinton Foundation is scrutinized in isolation, or whether charges of influence peddling are pursued, at which point Hillary Clinton's entire retinue from her days in the Senate and State Department would have reason to feel nervous.4. The Podesta Brothers: Most of those WikiLeaks bombshells the Clinton media is ignoring with such furious intensity are to, from, or copied to John Podesta, the CEO of Hillary Clinton's campaign, and probably the most powerful figure in Clintonworld not named ""Clinton."" In one of the latest WikiLeaks revelations, Podesta is caught telling Cheryl Mills, ""We are going to have to dump all those emails,"" and it would be ""better to do so sooner than later."" That sounds ominously like a conspiracy to destroy evidence in multiple federal criminal investigations, depending of course on which emails he was talking about, and what he meant by ""dumping"" them.Podesta's brother Tony, and the brothers' Podesta Group lobbying firm, are involved in an FBI corruption investigation related to the deposed president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych. The allegations boil down to illegal lobbying activities. Former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort also has a company that figures in the same investigation, so people across the 2016 political battlefield get to feel nervous about this one - but Podesta's pipeline into the Clinton machine means more highly-placed people in her camp could become part of the investigation.5. Terry McAuliffe's Campaign Donations: The Clintons' old friend Terry McAuliffe, currently the governor of Virginia, has been under FBI investigation for over a year by the Public Integrity unit over campaign fundraising and donations. Part of that investigation involves his time with the Clinton Global Initiative. The events of greatest interest, until now, were some curious foreign donations, but now we've got the eye-popping sums of money McAuliffe steered to Virginia state senate candidate Jill McCabe, whose husband just happens to be Andrew McCabe, who just happens to be a top FBI official, and who just happened to end up in charge of the Clinton Foundation investigation.This controversy doesn't seem to be fading despite rote denials of impropriety and swift media assurances it was all a big nothingburger. Some of those dismissals are based on Jill McCabe receiving her pile of McAuliffe money before her husband became involved with an FBI investigation of the Clintons, but not all of it was donated before that point, and it hardly strains credulity to assert that the Clinton machine was making down-payments for favors it knew full well it would need later. There have been calls for McCabe to recuse himself from the Clinton Foundation probe, and House Oversight Committee chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) has a few questions.The fascinating thing about these five investigations is not just that so many prominent people from the Clintons' orbit are caught up in them - the UK Daily Mail suggests a few more, lower-profile names - but that all of these cases could have trails leading to Anthony Weiner's computer. It will take a long time to go through all the material of interest, but meanwhile Weiner has suddenly become the key figure in Hillary Clinton's presidential bid. It seems safe to say nobody saw that coming.Clintonworld is looking like a carload of bandits in a chase film from the 1970s, heading for the state line with pedal to the metal, a swarm of cop cars roaring through the dust right behind them. Can Hillary Clinton and her crew hit the White House in a squeal of shredding tires and win total political immunity before the law catches up with them?

Other insurers are also leaving the exchanges in different markets nationwide, such as Humana, Aetna, and UnitedHealth.Still, the administration is aggressively targeting millenials in its push to enroll 14 million more people to offset the fact that not enough young, healthy people have signed up for health insurance to offset the sicker population.SIGN UP"	['Obama']	[]

The fact is that Hillary Clinton has had years -- decades, even -- to build an organization, and has a ground game that Donald Trump could not hope to match even if he had tried. So while Sanders was wowing the crowds -- and the media -- with his big rallies, Clinton was quietly making sure voters showed up at the polls or mailed in their ballots. That quiet, disciplined work paid off handsomely.Trump has several advantages that Sanders does not. For one thing, Sanders relied heavily on younger voters, who are among the least likely to vote in the end.Panoramic shot of thousands in hangar for #Trump #Albuquerque #NewMexico rally pic.twitter.com/AbaYhRsxQU-- Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) October 31, 2016But the idea that Trump can win still depends largely on the idea that there are ""hidden Trump"" voters who are not showing up in the polls and who will turn out in significant numbers on Election Day.That could very well be the case -- but it is impossible, by definition, to say with any degree of certainty.

In addition, the crowds at Trump rallies are not necessarily indications of broader support. All we know is that they are evidence that he has an energized core of fans. They may be more energized now, after the FBI re-opened its investigation into Clinton's email server, and after Clinton was caught cheating in the primary debates, and so on.Yet many of the people at Trump's rallies are long-time supporters. It is likely that a large rally does have some effect on voters in the surrounding area -- otherwise, Clinton herself would not bother doing them -- but Clinton's ""bird-dogging"" has turned some of that effect negative. (Even today, after the success of James O'Keefe and Project Veritas in exposing the truth, many -- perhaps most -- Democrats still think Donald Trump incited violence at his rallies, and view his events with horror.)Panoramic shot of crowd packed into arena for #Warren #Michigan #Trump rally pic.twitter.com/IgpdHxDAYy-- Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) October 31, 2016In the absence of a ground game that can compete with Clinton's, Trump's best hope may be that her own volunteers lose faith.There is some evidence to suggest that is a real risk. After the email scandal flared anew, Clinton campaign chair John Podesta wrote an email to Clinton supporters, telling them to buck up (and asking for money). ""Here's what this changes for you and this campaign: Absolutely nothing,"" he wrote.If Podesta really is worried, Trump's crowds have more reason to cheer.Joel B.

Throughout this year national security experts have struggled to defend Hillary Clinton's record on the issue.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERJust last month, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, expressed hope that Mrs. Clinton would be able to repair the damage to her credibility and ""address forthrightly her trustworthiness.""  On the last Friday of October, his hopes were dashed.Let's examine the facts. Gates is right about one thing: Hillary Clinton has a major ""credibility problem."" And it seems worse than Trump's. Which candidate has already had the opportunity to display credibility in foreign affairs, but has completely failed? Who has been the subject of multiple investigations for setting up a home-brew server, or lying to Congress and the American people about the events in Benghazi?The answer is Hillary Clinton, who set up a home-brew server which kept her official email communications private. Clinton did this no doubt realizing it could jeopardize American interests, lives, and national security. And if she didn't realize this, then she's certainly unfit to be commander-in-chief.Yet, despite all this, Secretary Gates inferred that Trump is unfit because, in his view, past presidents have surrounded themselves ""with independent-minded, knowledgeable and experienced advisers who would tell the president what he needed to hear, not what he wanted to hear. Sometimes presidents would take their advice, sometimes not. But they always listened."" Fair enough. It does however, leave me wondering how much of Secretary Gates' advice was ignored by President Obama. In his book, Duty, Gates says that 2010 ""....was a year of continued conflict and a couple of important White House breeches of faith.""  Mr. Gates explains that he was surprised by the announcement by the president of the implementation and timing of the repeal of the ""Don't ask, Don't tell"" policy for the military. Is this not something that the commander-in-chief should have consulted on with his Secretary of Defense?  Maybe Secretary Gates should have resigned in protest if he really believes listening to advice is important. It doesn't sound as if Secretary Clinton really listened to any advice when she set up her own server against all US government regulations.Moreover, Clinton -- not Trump -- will be the commander-in-chief who would continue President Obama's destructive, weak, and absolutely failed philosophy for how to approach world conflicts and the struggles between good and evil that inform them. Indeed, it's the absence of a clear sense of good and evil which has caused President Obama to fail to grasp the struggle between radical Islam and true freedom. Mrs. Clinton was the architect of the Libyan policy that sent Americans into combat against what was a fairly benign dictator at the time, Moamar Gadhafi. All this was done with no consent or even notification of the US Congress. This is not a record that qualifies her for the position of commander-in-chief.The more the evidence mounts that violent attacks across Europe and the United States (and indeed, the Middle East, Africa, and elsewhere) are driven by people who justify their killing sprees under Islamic theology, the more important it is to have a president who understands the nature of the enemy. Hillary has parroted the same rhetoric as Mr. Obama in denying what motivates Jihadists. Is that what we need in the next leader of our armed forces? Not if we take our national security seriously.Mrs. Clinton personally lied to the nation and more importantly, to the families of the four people killed in Benghazi when she blamed an obscure video for prompting the attack. Committing the US military to combat is one of the most serious decisions any president will ever make. There is no reason to believe that Mrs. Clinton is someone that Americans should trust with the lives of their sons and daughters.Donald Trump isn't perfect. It is understandable for Secretary Gates to point out problems with both candidates. But his uniformly declaring Trump unfit (and Clinton fit) to be president does nothing to help America face the unavoidable challenges the next president will have to face. At least Trump understands the very basic fact--a fact which has managed to escape President Obama (and those who think like him)--that there exist violent people who are motivated by radical Islam (we can take their word for it), who want to do us harm, and who directly threaten the existence of our free society as we currently know it. We must not be ashamed in making this observation. Our survival depends on it.Secretary Gates is right about one thing: ""[w]e have to make a decision."" Unlike him, however, I and many others believe the answer is quite the opposite.Lt. General (Ret.)

Whether one was Feeling-the-Bern or Trumping-the-GOP, Americans believe that many aspects of our society have been designed so that they are on the short end of the financial leash.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERA microcosm of this is the fleecing of cable/satellite (pay-TV) consumers by the Big Media/Cable Cabal in having channels forced on them that they do not watch resulting in overcharges of tens of billions of dollars per year. The Cabal is comprised of content/programmers such as Disney/ESPN and Time Warner, and pay-TV providers such as Comcast and AT&T/DirecTV. This represents a massive redistribution of wealth from working Americans to the 1/10th of 1 percent, billionaire Big Media moguls.A solution to this is called ""a la carte"" cable - or CableChoice - a simple concept in which consumers pay for only the channels they want. Surveys have shown that nearly half of consumers would prefer a la carte channels. Imagine when going to a restaurant that you are forced to buy multiple side dishes and a beverage with your prime rib. I know of no other industry in which a consumer has to pay for products he does not want in order to get the products he does want.Let's itemize the theft the Cabal has waged on working Americans. The average cable bill is roughly $50/month, excluding Internet, premium channels, and miscellaneous items. But what value are consumers getting in terms of the actual channels that they watch?The consumer views only 18 of the 189 channels available on the average cable system, according to Nielsen, the TV/Cable ratings firm. These 18 channels cost about $20/month wholesale, so adding a 20% markup the cost to consumers is $24/month; hence, the consumer could save $26/month - $312/year - if he paid only for the channels that he wanted. Multiplying $312 x 99 million (current number of pay-TV subscribers) = $30.9 billion/year that is fraudulently redistributed from cash-strapped, working/middle-class Americans to billionaire moguls, the vast majority of whom are liberal to leftwing.The worst culprit is the sports programming racket - by far the most expensive content. ESPN is the chief culprit as it gouges consumers by $7.21/month as of 2014. Notably, the next highest-priced channel is TNT at $1.48/month. Add ESPN 2 (90 cents/month) and the total cost of the ESPN Empire is $8.11/month - a whopping 16% of the average cable bill.Moreover, there are about 50 million female cable-subscriber head-of-households (HOH), and surveys have shown that overall they would not select ESPN if they had a choice. And if half of all cable subscribers could drop ESPN, as the data show they would, 75% of women would do so. So this affects particularly female HOH, who throw away $97/year being forced to pay for ESPN. If 3/4 of these discarded ESPN - 37.5 million - this would represent an enormous $3.64 billion per year hemorrhage from its bottom line, or 1/3 of ESPN's total revenue of $10.8 billion in 2014.So what is to be done? Here are some solutions:A model for the divorce of the content-carrier Cabal marriage is that in the late 1940s the federal government forced the movie studios to sell their theater chains, viewing this rightfully as an anti-competitive, restraint-of-trade conflict that did not serve the public interest by fostering competition (United States v. Paramount Pictures). Hence, for example, Comcast would be forced to sell CNBC, NBC, the NBC Sports Network, etc.Politically, this could be a winning issue for Trump. A President Trump could: 1) get his Justice Dept. to investigate the anti-competitive practices committed by the Cabal and break it up; 2) fine the Cabal billions for its legal/regulatory violations; 3) use the bully-pulpit to expose this theft from Americans by billionaire Cabal moguls; and 4) craft legislation to mandate CableChoice and other solutions.Furthermore, Trump could target women voters with the following: ""Do you like paying over $300/year in unnecessary payments to cable billionaires for channels you don't want?"" ""Would you like to stop being forced to pay $100 per year for ESPN alone, when you don't watch it?""A goal of economic public policy should be to foster innovation, competition, and investment. In the pay-TV world this requires a level playing field, transparency, open access to the pipes/programming, and enforcement of the antitrust laws. A President Trump could accomplish this because he is not beholden to Cabal special interests as are conventional politicians.Robert Brantley is a policy consultant and former FCC attorney.SIGN UP"	['Trump']	[]

Never?"" to which the Pope responded, ""If one carefully reads the declaration of St. John Paul, it goes in that direction, yes.""In its 2,000-year history, the Roman Catholic Church has never ordained women to the priesthood, but despite this fact, the Pope stressed that women are crucial to the Church, specifically from a ""Marian dimension.""""In Catholic ecclesiology there are two dimensions to think about,"" he said. ""The Petrine dimension, which is from the Apostle Peter, and the Apostolic College, which is the pastoral activity of the bishops, as well as the Marian dimension, which is the feminine dimension of the Church.""Francis underscored that the Holy Mother Church ""is a woman,"" and that the Church's ""spousal mystery"" as the bride of Christ can help us to understand these two dimensions.""I ask myself: who is most important in theology and in the mysticism of the Church: the apostles or Mary on the day of Pentecost? It's Mary!"" he said.The Church ""doesn't exist"" without this feminine dimension, or ""maternity,"" the Pope said, because the Church herself is feminine.Francis said that he thinks women ""can do so many things better than men, even in the dogmatic field,"" but noted that it is different from the role of priests and bishops in the Petrine dimension.In his 1994 declaration on the matter, Pope John Paul II invoked his full papal authority  in order to put the matter of women priests to rest.""Wherefore, in order that all doubt may be removed regarding a matter of great importance,"" he wrote, ""a matter which pertains to the Church's divine constitution itself, in virtue of my ministry of confirming the brethren, I declare that the Church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and that this judgment is to be definitively held by all the Church's faithful.""In his declaration, John Paul cited his predecessor, Pope Paul VI, noting that the reasons behind the Church's judgment included the example recorded in the Sacred Scriptures of ""Christ choosing his Apostles only from among men,"" the ""constant practice of the Church,"" which has imitated Christ in choosing only men, and ""her living teaching authority which has consistently held that the exclusion of women from the priesthood is in accordance with God's plan for his Church.""While consistently upholding this teaching, Pope Francis has insisted that woman need to play a larger and more visible role in the Church.""It is necessary to broaden the spaces for a stronger presence of women in the Church,"" Francis said in a 2013 interview. ""Women in the Church are essential. Mary, a woman, is more important than the bishops. I say this because we must not confuse function with dignity.""The Pope also called for a greater effort to develop ""a profound theology of women,"" adding that the ""feminine genius is needed in places where important decisions are made.""""The challenge today is this: to reflect on women's specific role even in the very places where authority is exercised in the various spheres of the Church,"" he said.Follow Thomas D.

Mike Pence Details Plan to Repeal and Replace ObamaCare	"VALLEY FORGE, Pennsylvania -- Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence spoke here along with his running mate Donald Trump to explain their plan for repealing and replacing ObamaCare.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERPence's remarks as prepared for delivery:Thank you for that introduction. It is great to be here with Dr. Ben Carson and so many of my former colleagues from the Congress, Sen. John Barrasso, Rep. Tom Price, Rep. Andy Harris, Rep. Mike Burgess, Rep. Scott DesJarlais, Rep. Renee Ellmers and Rep. Cynthia Lummis.Ladies and Gentlemen, it is wonderful to be back in Pennsylvania, just outside of Valley Forge, a turning point in the Revolutionary War, where Americans showed the resilience and determination to launch this experiment for freedom.I appreciated Dr. Carson's introduction, but as he well knows I prefer an introduction that is a little shorter. I'm a Christian, a conservative, and a Republicans, in that order.It is really amazing to think that a little more than three months ago, with my wife at my side, that I accepted my party's nomination to run - and serve - as the next Vice President of the United States of America.Now it's just seven days away. I have to tell you I joined this campaign in a heartbeat, because you have nominated a man for president who never quits, who never backs down. He is a fighter, he is a winner, and until very recently it seemed like he was fighting all on his own but now this movement is coming together, Pennsylvania is coming together and we are going to make Donald Trump the next President of the United States of America.And Donald Trump laid out his Contract with the American Voter short time ago. Working with Congress, we are going to get this economy growing again and create 25 million new jobs by reducing and simplifying our tax system, reforming our trade policies and reducing the regulatory burden. We are going to end the war on American energy, and we are going to invest in our nation's infrastructure. We are going to bring choice to our education system so that every child in America receives a great education. We will secure our border and end illegal immigration. We will rebuild our military and take care of our veterans, and we will bring law and order back to our communities struggling with crime, drugs and violence.And most importantly we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.I am humbled that Donald Trump has asked me to address this issue and speak to you about it.Some of you may know, before becoming Governor of the State of Indiana, I spent twelve years in Washington representing the Sixth District of Indiana in the House of Representatives.In 2009 and 2010, I was Chairman of the House Republican Conference, leading the fight with my fellow Republicans against Obamacare. I said then, and it has proven true, that when you mandate every American have a government-approved insurance whether they want it or need it, and when you create a government-run plan paid for with job-killing tax increases, that's a government takeover of health care. And that's the reason that not a single House or Senate Republican voted for Obamacare.Since 2010, Republicans have united in our desire to replace Obamacare with free market health care solutions that work for the American people. Good things happen when Republicans stand united.As Republicans head to the voting booth in one week, the momentum is with the Trump-Pence ticket. We are actually leading in the ABC/Washington Post poll that came out this morning.Independents and Democrats are joining this movement and Republicans across the country are continuing to come home. Across the spectrum, Americans know that Obamacare must be repealed and replaced, and that only by electing Donald Trump as the next President of the United States will we get it done.Today open enrollment begins on the Exchange, and once again millions of Americans are going to be disappointed in their lack of options and shocked by the high premiums.This government takeover of health care that we call Obamacare is failing in states across America, as it is in Pennsylvania, and the case has never been stronger for its repeal. It's important to remember, as Hillary Clinton boasted a little bit earlier this year, and I'm quoting, ""before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.""Do you remember the promises that President Obama and Hillary Clinton made?*President Obama said his health plan would cut the cost of family premiums by up to $2,500 a year. , Not true.*If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. Not true.*If you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it. Not true.The truth is premiums for employer plans have gone up by almost $5,000 since President Obama took office. And last week the Obama administration announced that the average premiums under Obamacare on the Exchanges are going to go up another 25% nationally.But that average hides the specific states where families are about to be pummeled with unprecedented sticker shock: for a 27 year-old buying an Obamacare plan, Arizona's premiums are going up by: 116%, Tennessee- 63%, Minnesota: 59%, Alabama: 58%, North Carolina: 40%. American wages haven't gone up by this much. Right here in Pennsylvania, it's a whopping 53% for next year, and a total of 69% increase when you add it to last year's rate hike. Your paycheck didn't go up by 53%!In Pennsylvania almost 110,000 households will see their rates spike drastically with absolutely no help from the government.Remember how Nancy Pelosi famously said ""we have to pass the bill so you can find out what is in it."" Well, they did, and it's even worse than we feared. What good is a healthcare plan if you can't afford to use it? With its increasing costs and high deductibles, most people are paying for something they can't afford to use. Fifty percent of Obamacare customers are now skipping medical visits to cut costs. Think about that, Americans are putting their personal health second because Obamacare's skyrocketing costs come first.Obamacare truly is a crushing weight on the American people and the American economy.I mean, even Bill Clinton said ""costs are going up, coverage is going down, it's the craziest thing in the world."" I guess even with the Clintons, sometimes the truth happens.But don't be deceived by Bill Clinton's newfound skepticism, Hillary Clinton's plan is actually to introduce what we call 'single payer' into the system, government run health insurance.She actually went to Canada and gave a speech and she told these Canadians and business groups that she wanted to get ""universal health care coverage like you have here in Canada."" Of course, we all know they've got socialized medicine in Canada.But my favorite quote came from President Obama himself. It was a week or so ago, and he was celebrating the third anniversary of the roll out of Obamacare. In his speech he actually compared Obamacare to the Samsung Galaxy 7 phones that spontaneously burst into flames. Here's the quote: President Obama said ""when one of these companies comes out with a new smartphone that has a few bugs, what do they do? They fix it, they upgrade it, unless it catches fire then they pull it off the market."" Well, what a coincidence, Mr. President, because that's exactly what we're going to do with Obamacare! We're going to pull it off the market so it stops burning up our wallets.Almost 20% of Americans eligible for Obamacare will have only one Exchange insurer this year. One plan is not a choice, it's a monopoly. At least 1.4 million Americans are about to lose their plan in 2017, and that's after millions already lost their plans in the first years of Obamacare. This means that too many people won't be able to continue seeing their doctor, which will interrupt treatment and care.Part of the reason costs went up is because Obamacare dictates that Americans buy a government designed insurance plan... laden with expensive and unnecessary benefits.No wonder that the young and healthy don't want to buy the plans. The coverage is expensive and the plans have huge deductibles that people can't afford. The average deductible for the so-called ""cheapest"" category of family plans this year is almost $12,000. That's more than 1/5th of the median household income in the U.S. What worse is that many of our best doctors have opted out of seeing patients with Exchange coverage.And Obamacare is killing jobs and it is destroying small businesses across America. Obamacare's employer mandates and new taxes have been destructive to the economy by killing jobs and reducing wages and growth. Obamacare imposed more than $1 trillion in new taxes on providers, taxpayers and businesses to pay for its failed policies. It has reduced pay for workers in small businesses and reduced employment by more than 350,000 jobs nationwide. Obamacare's employer mandate raised the minimum cost of hiring a full-time worker to $10.30/hour for larger employers, without increasing take-home pay for workers. State and local officials have conceded that Obamacare forced municipal governments to cut hours of part-time employees.It is time to end this government takeover of health care and start over with American solutions.For all of these reasons and so many more, Donald Trump and I are going to repeal Obamacare lock, stock and barrel.And when Donald Trump becomes President, we're going to replace Obamacare with healthcare reform that lowers the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government.We're going to reform health insurance in America with the power of the free market - that's the American way to meet our healthcare needs in an American future.A Trump plan will make health care affordable and will put people back in the driver's seat of their health care, not the government. We will get rid of the individual mandate, because the government shouldn't tell you how to spend your money. We will allow people to purchase insurance across state lines, just like you can with your auto or life or other insurance policies. We will create a transition period for those receiving subsidies to ensure that Americans don't face disruption or other hardship in their coverage.We will make it easier for Americans to open Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) that they can use to pay for health insurance. The idea of a tax-free account to pay for medical expenses was pioneered in my home state of Indiana to fix the flaws in our health care system.Health Savings Accounts allow you to control your health care dollars, pick the doctors and treatments that work for you without interference from insurance or government bureaucrats. Instead of giving subsidies to big insurance companies, the way Obamacare does, we will provide assistance directly to the American people through their Health Savings Accounts.There's an old saying that when everybody in your family is healthy, you have lots of problems. When one person in your family is sick, you have one problem. With a Health Savings Account, people can pick the insurance plan that works best for them and their family and gives them piece of mind if they get sick or have a major medical problem.Medicaid started in 1965 as health insurance program for the poor. Fifty years later Medicaid is broke and failing. And Obamacare has put the majority of the new people receiving coverage into this broken Medicaid program.In Indiana, we said, ""thanks, but no thanks"" and fought for almost two years to make coverage more widely available the right way, with the consumer-driven approach and Health Savings Accounts. We call it the Healthy Indiana Plan.Donald Trump and I will work with Republican majorities in the House and Senate to free states from Washington's top-down approach to Medicaid. States know what's best for their people and Donald Trump and I will give states new freedom and flexibility through block granting Medicaid so states can innovate and reform and design programs that meet the unique needs of their citizens.And health care costs will also come down when people have more control and know more about what their health care costs. As we empower Americans with greater control over their healthcare choices, we will also empower them with more information about the cost and quality of care in their hometown.Today, people have very little transparency into the cost or quality of their care. It's easier to compare prices when you buy a car or TV than it is to find information about a hospital or doctor. Donald Trump will fix that.When Americans can see the cost of their care, and have the power to make their own choices, the healthcare industry will give us lower costs and more options. Health care providers will be more responsive to patients' needs than they are to insurance and government bureaucrats.And we will protect Americans with pre-existing conditions so that they are not charged more or denied coverage, just because they have been sick, so long as they have paid their premiums consistently.And we will reverse Obamacare's federal takeover of the insurance market. We didn't see the type of rate increases across the nation when the States were running things.My friends, the choice in this election couldn't be more clear. With Hillary Clinton we will get more of the same from the last seven and a half years. More taxes, more spending, more regulation and more Obamacare.We can't trust Hillary Clinton with our health care anymore than we can trust her with classified information.Obamacare - the debacle previously known as Hillarycare - was a government takeover of health care from the start, plain and simple. It upended the miracle of the marketplace. Competition was crushed and replaced with the heavy hand of government control.Obamacare is a catastrophic failure. Hillary Clinton says she wants to double-down on failure.But we still have time to turn this around. Americans can choose a health care economy built on freedom, consumer choice and free market principles. It's just going to take all of us to do it.You know it is remarkable to me, as I show up to Donald Trump's rallies with tens of thousands of people there, what Donald Trump always says to me as we roll into those big rallies, he always tells me it's not about me or our party. It's about this movement of the American people, and the American people are going to Make America Great Again.To those Republicans who believe we can have a health care system built on a free market economy and consumer choice, we need to say with one voice, it is time to come home.It is time to come home and elect Donald Trump the next President of the United States.It is time to come home and reelect Republican majorities in the House and Senate.And it is time to come home to bring their 30-year obsession with government-run health care to an end by ensuring that Hillary Clinton will never be elected President of the United States.Ladies and gentlemen, with one week to go for a great victory for the American people, I give you the man with the vision, the agenda and the leadership to restore freedom to our health care economy, and Make America Great Again, the next President of the United States, Donald Trump.Trump then took the stage and spoke of more plans for a Trump-Pence administration.Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana Thank you for that introduction.

Mike Pence, made one of their last joint appearances before Election Day near the site of George Washington's historic winter encampment on Tuesday. Their focus: repealing and replacing Obamacare.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERPence took the lead, with Trump deferring to his running mate's extensive experience in innovation in health care policy.In January 2015, Gov. Pence launched the Healthy Indiana Plan, or HIP 2.0. The plan is a modified version of the Medicaid expansion that many other conservative governors, such as Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, have rejected (and which some had promised to reject, but later accepted). It expands Medicaid to those living within 138% of the poverty level, but also requires them to make contributions to their own health insurance, on a sliding income-based scale.Pence had to negotiate with President Barack Obama to receive approval for his modifications, and faced criticism from conservatives for accepting any part of Obamacare. But he defended his decision in an op-ed in the Indianapolis Star in January: ""Obamacare did not create the Healthy Indiana Plan. HIP existed before Obamacare, and it will exist after Obamacare."" He said Obamacare's repeal would require a transition period, but the program would survive.The contributions are made to a health savings account called a Personal Wellness and Responsibility (POWER) account, building on a program started by Pence's predecessor, Mitch Daniels. And the policy has largely been a success. Earlier this year, Gov. Pence announced that HIP 2.0 patients had reduced emergency room visits by 40% and that 70 percent of participants were paying into their POWER accounts.On Tuesday, Pence touted that experience.""I stand before you today, because today open enrollment begins on the Obamacare exchanges. And once again, millions of Americans are going to be disappointed by their lack of options, and, frankly, shocked by the high premiums and the cost of health insurance. This government takeover of health care that we call Obamacare is failing in states across America, as it is here in Pennsylvania, and the case has never been stronger for repeal.""""Americans are putting their personal health second because Obamacare's skyrocketing costs are too expensive and too burdensome,"" Pence warned.He recalled that Hillary Clinton had not only backed Obamacare, but claimed credit for inspiring it. He reminded the audience ""Before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare."" He also reminded them that President Obama had compared the program to the disastrous Samsung Galaxy 7 smartphone (which was notorious for bursting into flames, due to battery problems). And he noted that that even former Bill Clinton had said: ""The costs are going up, coverage is going down, it's the craziest thing in the world.""""I guess even with a Clinton, sometimes truth happens,"" Pence quipped, to applause.In a Trump presidency, he said, ""we're going to repeal Obamacare -- lock, stock, and barrel."" He then went on to explain what would replace it, using the free market -- and without growing the government.The plan includes:Pence noted that HSAs were pioneered in Indiana, and that the Trump plan would provide support directly to individuals using HSAs, rather than to insurance companies from whom individuals were forced to buy insurance under the current system. He called Medicaid ""broken,"" noting that ""Obamacare has put a majority of the people receiving new coverage into a broken system."" And he touted the reforms he had made under HIP 2.0 as an example of how states can innovate.He concluded: ""Obamacare is a catastrophic failure. Hillary Clinton says she wants to double down on that failure ... We can make health care in America great again.""He also appealed to ""NeverTrump"" Republicans: ""It's time to come home.""Pence introduced Donald Trump, who was greeted with familiar enthusiasm by the audience.Valley Forge, PA Nov. 1, 2016Trump pledged to ask Congress to convene a special session to repeal and replace Obamacare, warning that premiums in Pennsylvania would increase more than 60%.He warned that health care costs were overwhelming families' ability to pay their bills, and even their mortgages. He warned that millennials and young people would face an ""unfair"" situation due to Obamacare, where they ""will be totally crushed by these massive health care costs before they even get started on their journey through life."" And he noted that local residents only had one insurance provider from which to choose, in one-third of Pennsylvania counties including Philadelphia.""Hillary Clinton wants to expand Obamacare and make it even more expensive. She wants to put the government totally in charge of health care in America,"" he said.""If we don't repeal and replace Obamacare, we will destroy American health care forever. It's one of the single most important reasons why we must win on November 8th. We must win.""As Pence did, Trump outlined the basic elements of his replacement plan.""Our replacement plan includes Health Savings Accounts, a nationwide insurance market where you can purchase across state lines, and letting states manage Medicaid dollars. So much better.""We will create quality, reliable, affordable health care in a free market where parents can make the health care decisions that they really want to make for their families. It will be a much better health care at a much less expensive cost.""Trump also hit points from his stump speech, talking about bringing manufacturing jobs back to Pennsylvania, increasing military spending, ending Common Core, expanding school choice, and other priorities.Pence was introduced by Dr. Ben Carson, who was one of Trump's rivals in the primary, and later endorsed him. ""We're going to bring the power back to the people and to the health providers,"" he said of Trump's plans to replace Obamacare.(Trump returned the favor in his own remarks, saying he hoped Carson would serve in his administration.)Sen. John Barasso (R-WY) had kicked off the event. He reminded the audience that Pennsylvania is facing steep double-digit increases in health insurance premiums under Obamacare next year. And, he added, ""What does Hillary Clinton say about this? More obamacare. What does Bill Clinton say about this? 'Craziest thing I ever saw!',"" to laughter and applause.Rep. Tom Price (R-GA), who is also a physician, led a group of House members onstage, many of whom have medical degrees or expertise. Rep. Michael Burgess (R-TX) said: ""Many of us watched in horror in 2009 and 20010 as no Republicans were consulted and this thing was rammed through,"" noting that then-White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel exploited one crisis, only to create another.Rep. Renee Elmers (R-NC), who noted the strong presence of women in the room, mocked President Barack Obama's comparison of Obamacare to a first home: ""If it's a house, it's an outhouse,"" she said, to laughter.Joel B.

Follow him on Twitter at @joelpollak.Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana SIGN UPLocal Pennsylvania resident Ray Ballone was asked if, as some have suggested, a Hillary Clinton administration would be wrought with scandal and investigations.""Four years of that -- scandals,"" he told Breitbart News.Ballone said that he had been a supporter of Dr. Ben Carson for president, but now supports Trump.Another Trump supporter, Nick Xu, told Breitbart News that he is a legal Chinese immigrant to the United States and has been volunteering for two months on the Trump campaign. He said that he is a naturalized U.S. citizen. ""I like his policy. I myself [am] an immigrant from China. I went to school in Russia,"" said Xu, who added that he speaks Russian, Chinese and English. ""I'm a immigrant. I'm a minority here, but I like his policy.""Xu added that ""the media has a lot of bias[ed] report[ing] on Trump. It's not true. I watch his speech[es] myself on YouTube, you know the full speech. So I like his policy about, you know, bring[ing] back jobs, national security, you know, immigration, because the current administration, you know, put illegal immigrant[s] over legal immigrant[s] and I don't like that.

Harry Reid Aims to Criminalize Politics over FBI Investigation	"WASHINGTON--Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) is accusing FBI Director James Comey of violating federal law. That's leading senior elected officials to express alarm over what they call an attempt to criminalize law enforcement.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFBI agents discovered 650,000 emails to and from Huma Abedin--Hillary Clinton's closest aide and confidant--when those agents examined a computer as part of a federal child pornography/pedophile criminal investigation of Abedin's husband, disgraced former Rep. Anthony Weiner. At the same time, at least four FBI field offices--Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, New York City, and Little Rock, Ark.--were also investigating possible law-breaking and corruption (""pay for play,"" etc.) with the Clinton Foundation.When Comey announced he had reopened the criminal investigation into Clinton's emails, the Far Left threw out its glowing praise of Comey from the summer (such as House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi's extolling Comey, saying, ""We are privileged in our country to have him be director of the FBI""), and is now excoriating him as a Republican political hack (news that would shock everyone involved with Republican Party politics).But Senate Minority Leader Reid took this to a new level, accusing Comey not only of being political, but of breaking federal law. Reid alleges that Comey violated the Hatch Act, which makes it illegal for a federal officer to use the powers of the government to support or oppose a particular candidate.The Hatch Act was designed to prevent federal officials from abusing their power to deliberately interfere in a federal election.""Once again, Harry Reid is going over the top,"" says Ken Blackwell, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Human Rights Commission and senior elected official, one of the most prominent and respected Republican leaders of the past quarter-century.Hillary Clinton's husband Bill Clinton  won the White House in 1992. Days before that election, Justice Department investigator Lawrence Walsh went public with an indictment of Reagan Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger regarding Iran-Contra, casting a shadow on President George H.W. Bush right before Election Day.""Clinton supporters didn't run to the cameras back then to condemn a federal law enforcement investigator making such an announcement as people were getting ready to vote when the shoe was on the other foot,"" Blackwell quipped.""This is just the latest episode in the criminalizing of politics,"" Blackwell continued. ""In this case, Comey had shocked Republicans by not recommending indictments in July. It's absurd to say that when the evidence shows he needs to reopen a criminal investigation that somehow he's breaking the law by doing his job to enforce the law.""""It's Comey's job as head of the FBI to investigate possible violations of federal criminal law,"" Blackwell added. ""No candidate is above the law.""Saying that the FBI cannot examine possible evidence that any candidate--including a presidential candidate--has broken the law, would essentially mean police agencies should not treat those investigation subjects the same way any private citizen would be treated. It suggests that powerful elites in this country don't have to follow the same laws that ordinary Americans must follow. The narrative that establishment elites should be held to the same standards as everyday Americans has been a central thrust of Donald Trump's campaign.""No candidate is 'too big to jail,'"" Blackwell explained. ""Having worked closely with U.S. presidents, I can tell you that the power radiating from the Oval Office is staggering in its scope.""When there's a possibility that a person within reach of acquiring such massive power is in fact a criminal, he continued, ""every American should want law enforcement to do its job and investigate that possibility before you make that person the most powerful person in the world.""""Even the White House is backing Comey on this,"" Blackwell concluded. ""Reid needs to rein in his rhetoric before criminalizing politics becomes so toxic that we get the kind of political corruption I had to confront in some countries we don't want to emulate when I served our nation as an ambassador.""Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.
