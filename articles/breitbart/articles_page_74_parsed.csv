She was on staten island in her car parked a few feet from the waters edge with her foot on the gas pedal and the car in park. She called me to tell me the stress of all of this office crap with wjc [William Jefferson Clinton] and cvc [Chelsea Victoria Clinton] as well as that of her family had driven her to the edge and she couldn't take it anymore. I spent a while on the phone with her preventing her from doing that, as I have a few times in the past few months, and was able to reach roger and her shrink.Band was a co-founder and president of Teneo, a global consulting firm, served as a top aide to Bill Clinton and he helped create the Clinton Global Initiative. The email was leaked because a copy went to John Podesta, another Clinton aide who is now the chairman of Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign.The Band email was a response to a Dec. 7 message from Hillary Clinton's aide, Cheryl Mills, offering an office reorganization to reduce the intra-office conflicts.This model would mean that all non-Foundation entities would no longer be  co-located with Foundation; that folks would be on a single payroll -  Foundation or personal. Whatever rules the Foundation creates for folks  being able to earn outside income would apply equally (so e.g., if Bari is  on the Foundation payroll and Dorvir; and Ami is on Teno and the Foundation.After creating this office, Mills suggested that Chief Executive Officer or Chief of Staff be assigned personally to Bill Clinton. She explains that that person would be ""accountable for ensuring that the implementation of the President's will occurs in the various entities and the various entities would operate  according to the time and engagement and direction as necessary as the President gives.""In his Dec. 8 reply, Band agreed with the proposed reorganization, cited the near-suicide, and offered his view of Chelsea's problems.I'm sure Chelsea is more concerned with a mostly false story in the distinguished NY Post about MF Global and Teneo not her role in what happened to Laura/Bruce, what she is doing to the organization or the several of stories that have appeared in the ny post about her father and a  multitude of women over the yearsFor teneo, well before mf global, we have been discussing this. Its going to hurt Teneo to have WJC on the adv bd any longer but we need come up with  a reorg concept for the relationship with WJC and Teneo that is lower key and handled privately and properly that we should discuss.Teneo is an investment banking organization and international advisory firm that Band was co-founder of. Teneo acted as the middleman between the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton State Department.Late last night, laura graham called me as she couldn't reach my brother or her shrink.

His proposal would simply expand that allowance so that Mexicans who have gone through background checks, finger printing, etc., may possess government-approved firearms in their ""private businesses and vehicles.""According to Fusion, Preciado's proposal would allow ""bus drivers, cabbies, truckers and other transportation operators to carry firearms to protect themselves, their merchandise and their passengers."" He believes the violence raging throughout Mexico is more than enough justification for making such changes.He said, ""We are in the midst of a very complex situation and we are simply arguing that if the State cannot protect us then it should at least allow us to defend ourselves.""Preciado's proposal has been heavily criticized by politicians who do not want to see changes allowing law-abiding Mexicans to possess the same kinds of rifles that were sold to straw purchasers during the Obama administration's Operation Fast and Furious. These were the same kinds of rifles used in the Paris terror attacks on January 7, 2105, and November 13, 2015. As it currently stands, Mexican rules for law-abiding citizens are very strict. The University of Sydney's Gun Policy center notes:Civilians are not allowed to possess weapons of war, including automatic firearms, sub-machine guns, machine guns, .357 Magnum revolvers and those greater than .38 calibre, handguns greater than 9mm, rifles and carbines of .223, 7mm, 7.62 and .30 calibres, or shotguns with barrels shorter than 635mm or greater than 12 gauge.Preciado rejects the criticism his proposal has received. He stresses that he is not pushing to change the types of guns Mexicans may own. Rather, he is pushing to expand their ability to have government-approved guns with them in more places for self-defense. He says critics ""are arguing in extremes"" by suggesting that law-abiding Mexicans would cause problems if given the ability to be armed to defend their lives and property.It has been ""more than 40 years"" since anyone has tried to broaden Mexican citizens' ability to be armed for self-defense.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

The case will decide how much of Apple's $399 million patent infringement lawsuit Samsung must pay.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""It's a titanic struggle between two business titans before the Supreme Court, but it has real implications for everybody around America who wants to build the next great business,"" said Sparapani. ""In short, we're maybe five years into, six years into, a fight over whether or not Samsung has infringed on the design - meaning like the look, the feel - of the iPhone, the original iPhone"" he explained. ""Now, you might think this is a pretty esoteric debate, and we should let two big businesses fight it out, and if Samsung infringed on Apple's design, that would be fine. And everybody wants Apple to continue to build cool new products that are sexy and appealing."" ""The debate here is whether or not a federal circuit court got the law completely wrong, and upended more than 200 years of patent jurisprudence by deciding that because they believed that Samsung had infringed on Apple's design of its iPhone, that they were going to award a massive damage return that was calculated based on the total value of all of the iPhones that were not purchased because Samsung was selling a competing product - as opposed to deciding what the percentage was of the design that went into people's decision about whether or not to buy the Samsung phone versus the Apple phone,"" he continued. Sparapani explained that the Supreme Court's decision could have huge repercussions for the entire U.S. economy. For example, he said, ""Just imagine that you and I went out and bought a car. Now, we're buying a car. It's a thing that takes us from place to place; it allows us to drive ourselves, our children, our families. When you go into a dealership, and you choose between car A and car B, you are still choosing between cars, and 99 percent of the value to you as a purchaser is based on the car. Maybe it's 90 percent, but it's not 100 percent, based on whether the car looks like a Corvette or whether it looks like a Chevy. And if Chevy decides to build another car that looks like a Corvette or a Porsche, the question for the Supreme Court is, 'Should the entire value of that patent infringement be awarded to Corvette or Porsche because Chevy knocked off their design?'""""That's a pretty big deal. Here's why: Around the country, we've had an enormous number of litigation shops. We call them 'patent trolls.' One- and two-person law firms that stand up, and all they do is look to sue companies and force them to go to court and give away damage settlements because what they have to decide is whether or not years of litigation in our federal court system, and all of the millions of dollars of costs of defending a frivolous lawsuit, are worth the effort and the time and the sapping of the resources of that particular company,"" Sparapani said.""These trolls go around and find small companies that have just been funded by advisers, by angel investors, and they say, 'Aha! Here's a company that's ripe for suit! It's young; if we sue it now, we can force them to settle us, effectively give us a damage settlement, rather than going through years of court litigation, only to have the case dismissed because, of course, it was frivolous in the beginning,'"" he said. Sparapani worried that if the Supreme Court upheld the judgment against Samsung, awarding Apple damages based on all potentially lost sales of iPhones based on Samsung's patent infringement, ""a whole new group of lawyers will set up shop around the country and file off lawsuit after lawsuit after lawsuit that are completely frivolous, designed to sap the innovation of the next great American companies, all based on the misinterpretation of our patent dispute.""Marlow related the experience of a friend who was sued by patent trolls, but also made the argument that strong patent laws, with steep penalties for infringement, are essential for nourishing the spirit of innovation because they help ensure a payday for inventors and risk-takers. ""How can we have a common sense patent system when it seems like both extremes are so devastating?"" he asked.""It's amazing that the court system had gotten this right for literally the entire history of our democracy, since we began to have patents in the United States,"" Sparapani replied. ""It's only in this particular instance, where the lower court seems to have re-interpreted the law, that we're really deviating from the rules and boundaries.""He said it was important to evaluate both sides of the argument, understanding that patent laws could either help innovation to flourish or crush it beneath heavy legal judgments.""I buy all of my products from Apple. I think they're great products,"" said Sparapani. ""We want Apple to continue to receive the value of providing cool new designs and great new products, and nobody should deny that. We want the pharmaceutical companies to be incentivized to have great new blockbuster drugs they develop. The same is true with every small inventor around the country. We want them to get a chance to build a great new product, a sexy new design, and give us stuff that we really like and need as consumers.""He said the Apple vs. Samsung case gave the Supreme Court ""a chance to go back to the way the law has always been,"" which, he said, ""I think is the way it should be in this case - which is to say that yes, we give Apple some benefit for its great new design; they should be rewarded for cool new designs and cool new products, but we don't give them the entire award of the entire value of all the lost phones. Rather, we find a percentage that is calculated based on the amount that the design influenced a consumer's purchase. And that's the amount that is awarded in any design infringement case.""He said there have been ""years of expert testimony"" in this particular high-profile case, to help courts arrive at a reasonable percentage.""We've had design experts. We've had people talk to multiple juries. We've had the juries fight it out. And somewhere in there - there's no mathematical formula for how much design matters. It may matter more to you than it matters to me. I go and buy a car just simply because I need a car. Other people love the look and feel of a particularly new car, and they want to have it. They believe it's a showpiece, and it says something about them. Somewhere in there, we can find an approximation of what the average consumer, that theoretical person, would do and how much influence it would have. And it's worked for the entire history of our republic,"" Sparapani argued.He noted that the background cases behind the Apple vs. Samsung suit were about ""shovels and sewing machines, and they were decided in the nineteenth century.""""These aren't new problems, and somehow, we've been able to figure it out and decide that a shovel is a thing. It's got utility. We buy it to shovel dirt or snow. And we may like the look and feel of a particularly new shovel, or a new shovel may have a revolutionary design that makes it easier to use and cause less injury to people who are lifting heavy things. There's a value proposition in there, which has to be weighed. And I think we can find a way to reach that average consumer, and what he or she would want, to see in terms of how much their design, how much the look and feel of something has influenced the consumer's opinion and purchasing power,"" he urged.Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.LISTEN:SIGN UP""It's a titanic struggle between two business titans before the Supreme Court, but it has real implications for everybody around America who wants to build the next great business,"" said Sparapani.

""Who better to deliver that message than First Lady-turned-Secretary of State who could become America's first female president?"" he asked. Favreau wrote:Hillary can pick up the mantle here in a very inspiring way. She just has to tweak it and be careful that it doesn't sound like she's listing off  interest groups - here's my black speech, here's my Latino policy, here's my woman's event, etc. She needs to combine her policies with her record with a vision of the country and the world where we're stronger together than we are divided against each other. That's different than ""stronger together than we are on our own,"" which would be more of a Bernie/Obama '12 message that's all about right-wing economics. This is an evolution of that message that's primarily a response to the intolerance and bigotry of Trump and the right. She should be talking about love and kindness. She should be talking about mutual respect and tolerance. She should be talking about rebuilding the bonds of community and rebuilding friendships, not just between nations, but between people all over the world. Not just compassion for compassion's sake - but because we're stronger when we're pulling together' when everyone feels like they're part of the team.He argued that Clinton could carry the inspiring Obama message forward if she was careful.

6	6	http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/11/national-group-use-graphic-images-sway-swing-states-vote-abortion/	National Group Launches Anti-Abortion Campaign Including Graphic Images	"A national pro-life group is kicking off a voter education campaign across the swing states of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida to urge Americans to vote against abortion in the November election.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERCreated Equal will call upon Americans to ""Vote Anti-Abortion"" in its ""battleground tour"" by using graphic images of victims of abortion on airplane tow banners, billboard trucks, and jumbotron television screens.The group notes recent research confirms that, while controversial, the practice of presenting undecided voters with these graphic images of abortion victims increases votes for pro-life candidates by up to 30 percent.According to the Canadian Centre for Bio-Ethical Reform (CCBR), the controversy over the use of graphic images of abortion victims ""is perhaps one of the most enduring debates within the pro-life movement.""To study the issue, a survey, commissioned by CCBR and administered by an independent party, canvassed 1,741 participants before and after viewing images of abortion victims.According to the survey:[R]esults found a statistically significant shift in pro-life worldview, a greater negative perception of abortion, a decreased degree of permissiveness and liberalism towards abortion law, and a significant gain in pro-life political views after seeing abortion victim imagery.Those identifying as completely pro-life increased by nearly 30% following the campaign, with those identifying as pro-abortion also decreasing in their degree of remaining support for abortion. Overall, there was a statistically significant gain of nearly 17% toward a pro-life worldview. Those who were generally pro-life had an overall gain of 7%, with the corresponding loss (of those generally pro-abortion), also 7%. The degree of permissiveness toward abortion was statistically decreased and support for incremental pro-life gains, like gestational limits, substantially increased by 15% overall.In a report titled ""A Statistical Analysis on the Effectiveness of Abortion Victim Photography in Pro-Life Activism,"" author Dr. Jacqueline C. Harvey, a Texas-based bioethics and public policy scholar who teaches political science at Tarleton State University, observes the claim of opponents that graphic imagery is ineffective is unsupported.Harvey concludes the study shows that feelings about abortion shifted significantly toward a negative view of abortion, with fewer individuals reporting a positive view about abortion after the imagery campaign.She writes:Additional analysis found that the strength of one's feelings toward abortion was conclusively parallel to political views about abortion, with those who felt strongly positive about abortion favouring no legal restrictions, and those who felt strongly negative favouring complete prohibition. This suggests that changing how the public feels about abortion impacts how they vote for candidates willing and able to enact legal restrictions that actually save lives. Abortion victim imagery was effective at changing these feelings, with upwards of 90% responding that seeing these images increased their negative feelings toward abortion.Harvey also points out results of the study showed ""no evidence to support claims that the strategy of abortion victim images does any harm whatsoever, or that it inhibits other strategies.""A video produced by Created Equal shows that, soon after being presented with images of abortion victims, a student at Columbus State Community College changed his view on abortion.Asked by the interviewer what he thought about abortion prior to viewing the images, the student says, ""I thought it was like a normal process.""Created Equal will use the images in its ""Vote Anti-Abortion"" campaign beginning October 17 in Pittsburgh, then moving on through Harrisburg and State College, Pennsylvania. The group will then travel across Ohio through Toledo, Cincinnati, and Columbus, and continue on to Florida from Jacksonville to Orlando, to Tampa and St. Petersburg, and end up in Miami on November 7.Mark Harrington, national director of Created Equal, explains to those who are put off by the pictures, ""Recent statistical data confirms what pro-lifers have witnessed for decades: seeing abortion victims alters how individuals feel about abortion--which in turn influences how they think about abortion, including their political views.""He continues:We are facing the most important election of our lifetime. Our nation's fate and the lives of millions of preborn children hang in the balance this election; 2016 is a turning point for America.We are on the streets, on the road and in the air. Our comprehensive outreach campaign will educate thousands of voters in battleground states.Created Equal conducted a campaign featuring tow banners bearing the message ""Rescue UNborn Children"" during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. The group urged the GOP to retain the pro-life plank in its platform. In addition, Created Equal confronted attendees at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia with the images and the message ""Defend UNborn Children,"" with respect to their party's most radical pro-abortion platform in its history.Created Equal's airplane tow banners can be viewed here and here.[R]esults found a statistically significant shift in pro-life worldview, a greater negative perception of abortion, a decreased degree of permissiveness and liberalism towards abortion law, and a significant gain in pro-life political views after seeing abortion victim imagery.
Those identifying as completely pro-life increased by nearly 30% following the campaign, with those identifying as pro-abortion also decreasing in their degree of remaining support for abortion. Overall, there was a statistically significant gain of nearly 17% toward a pro-life worldview. Those who were generally pro-life had an overall gain of 7%, with the corresponding loss (of those generally pro-abortion), also 7%. The degree of permissiveness toward abortion was statistically decreased and support for incremental pro-life gains, like gestational limits, substantially increased by 15% overall.Additional analysis found that the strength of one's feelings toward abortion was conclusively parallel to political views about abortion, with those who felt strongly positive about abortion favouring no legal restrictions, and those who felt strongly negative favouring complete prohibition. This suggests that changing how the public feels about abortion impacts how they vote for candidates willing and able to enact legal restrictions that actually save lives. Abortion victim imagery was effective at changing these feelings, with upwards of 90% responding that seeing these images increased their negative feelings toward abortion.We are facing the most important election of our lifetime.

Michael Patrick Leahy reports that Clinton acknowledged this reality for refugees pouring into Jordan.Director of National Intelligence James Clapper already admitted that the U.S. cannot vet these refugees, so this may be an instance of Clinton telling the public a different position than you take in private.Emails also show Clinton's inner circle caught in an echo chamber when it comes to constitutional rights for aliens (legal or illegal, not just refugees). Mandy Grunwald writes of wanting to ""whack"" a Republican ""for trying to change the Constitution to deny babies born here the right to American citizenship if their parents aren't citizens? (basically get rid of the 14th Amendment).""To the contrary, the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not guarantee citizenship to the children of foreigners, whether they are in the United States legally or not. Congress chooses to grant citizenship very broadly in the Immigration and Nationality Act, but the Constitution does not require it except for the children of American citizens born on American soil.This is not exclusively a conservative idea; in addition to constitutional conservative stalwarts like Prof. John Eastman, noted judicial activist Judge Richard Posner on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has declared that the Fourteenth Amendment does not confer birthright citizenship, calling the idea ""nonsense.""Moreover, in 1993 now-Democratic Senate Leader Harry Reid introduced a bill (the Immigration Stabilization Act) that would change current law, denying citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants. Since the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified in 1868, the constitutional contours of this issue have not changed from 1993 through 2016--only the politics of a cynical attempt to create millions of Democratic voters for those who racially stereotype foreigners from certain countries.All this goes back to the famous line of Justice Robert Jackson that the Constitution is not a ""suicide pact."" It is a document that ensures several fundamental principles of fairness and justice--like due process and equal protection--to all persons, whether citizens or not. But for the most part, it is a document predicated upon American exceptionalism, and showcasing an ""America First"" paradigm. The Constitution frames issues like national security and immigration in terms of what is best for America.The Supreme Court seemed split on what the Constitution requires when it comes to immigrants, including refugees. Liberal justices refer to constitutional limits on immigration laws, while conservative justices say that the Constitution gives Congress complete discretion and full authority to determine who can cross the U.S. border and who can stay in this country.On issues of immigration, refugees, and the Constitution, Trump and Clinton are worlds apart--presenting voters with a clear choice.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

Blue Bell's announcement followed the cookie dough manufacturer's recall of its ingredients supplied to Blue Bell and other companies.Aspen Hills, Inc. says there is no evidence of listeria in their products but is ""acting out of an abundance of caution.""

If it weren't for the dogged research of one citizen activist--Brenda Arthur--no one but a tiny select group of insiders would have a clue about what was coming.""Because we are a small state we have so far escaped some of the invasion devastation other larger states have experienced by their towns being invaded and overrun by hoards of peoples who neither want to assimilate or are assimilating,"" Arthur, a resident of Charleston, wrote Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), chairman of the Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest on October 1:West Virginia already faces a budget shortfall for 2018 FY of 290 million dollars , the unemployment rate is 6.5% and above the national average , the assault on our coal industry has cost 700 coal miners their jobs, there is a drug epidemic, and the June flood disaster severely damaged or destroyed 1200 homes. In addition, there are other economic factors that are impacting our state. How does it even remotely make sense to bring foreign nationals to our state at such high tax payer expense when so many of our own people are suffering? Further, our country is 20 trillion dollars in debt. A sane nation does not do this!""I along with others are trying very hard to fight this invasion and keep this from happening here to our beloved state of West Virginia,"" Arthur adds:[T]his program has been operating very much in secret since its inception in 1980. Once I became aware of this effort to resettle refugees in my state of West Virginia I contacted 7-8 elected officials: 2 town mayors, 3-4 state senators and or delegates, my U.S. Congressman Alex Mooney, U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito, and the Governor's office. Even though refugees had been resettled in West Virginia no one knew anything about it. The Chief of Staff for Governor Tomblin even told me that West Virginia was not scheduled to receive any refugees. I later found out that the Governor had in fact signed a state refugee plan 3-4 months before I made the call to his office. This is not accountable or transparent government.Critics of the federal refugee resettlement program warn that, if elected, Hillary Clinton will flood the country with Muslim refugees. Clinton is on the record as supporting an increase in the number of Syrian refugees resettled annually in the United States from the 12,500 who arrived in FY 2016, 99 percent of whom are Muslim, to 65,000.During the first six days of October, more than 3,000 refugees were resettled in the United States, an annualized run rate of more than 185,000, which would represent a dramatic increase from the 84,995 refugees resettled in the United States in FY 2016 and the 110,000 the Obama administration has proposed for FY 2017.The State Department has secretively tried to expand resettlement to at least 47 small communities. In some of these communities, like Rutland, Vermont, local officials are complicit in this secrecy. In others, such as Flint, Michigan, they appear to be unaware.During FY 2016, 25 refugees were resettled in West Virginia, according to the Department of State's interactive website, about one every two weeks.Eight of these refugees were from Burma, eight from Eritrea, five from Syria, and four from Iraq.All five Syrian refugees were resettled in Charleston.In the first six days of October, the first month of FY 2017, five refugees, all from Iraq, have been resettled in West Virginia, more than one each day.If this pace of refugee resettlement continues throughout the remaining 359 days of the fiscal year, over 400 refugees would be resettled in West Virginia in FY 2017, sixteen times the number of refugees resettled in FY 2016.In her letter to Sen. Sessions, Charleston resident Arthur explained how the resettlement agencies have planned for this dramatic increase in secrecy:USCCB (United States Conference of Catholic Bishops) operating as Catholic Charities of West Virginia is the major contractor in our state placing refugees. EMM (Episcopal Migration Ministries) has filed with the State Department to also become a contractor here in West Virginia. I never hear the contractors speak of the interests of the people. They always speak of the interests of the refugees. I very much want to see the Episcopal Migration Ministries application to ""set up shop"" rejected. I have tried to get word regarding this to my U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito but it seems to fall on deaf ears or it is not being communicated to her.On August 1 ,2016 I contacted the State Refugee Coordinator here in West Virginia to request a copy of the R&P (Reception & Placement ) Abstract for 2016 and 2017. I was asked who I was. I replied that I am just a private citizen who wants to know about the refugee resettlement program in West Virginia. The State Refugee Coordinator then told me that they couldn't give this out to just anybody. I asked her why not when it is a public document and the program is paid for mostly with our tax dollars. She just replied that we have our process and that I would have to make a FOIA request . I did make that request and received the documents on August 9 ,2016 .In finding out more about how the contractors operate I learned that they are to hold quarterly ""stakeholder"" meetings to track and report on the refugees who have been placed. I found out that they consider entities like the school officials, law enforcement, free clinic providers, potential employers , social service providers ,and others the ""stakeholders"" ---not the people of the community. We are completely left out while they operate in ""secret"".Arthur argues that it's time to repeal the Refugee Act of 1980, the federal law upon which the refugee resettlement program is based:It would be in the best interests of the refugees to one day return to their home country. Meanwhile , for every 1 refugee brought here we could provide the necessities of life for 12 refugees there. The Refugee Admissions program also poses a threat to our national security as you know . This fact alone should be sufficient to de-fund this program and put a halt to the refugee admissions ""racket"" .Senator Sessions, the Refugee Act of 1980 ultimately needs to be repealed. Meanwhile, ""We the People "" must rely on advocates like you who will operate in our interests ---not the interests of the UN , lobbyists , globalists , or any and all enemies both foreign and domestic who are out to undermine the sovereignty, safety, and security of our beloved and great nation.Congress has failed to pass a budget for FY 2017, which began on October 1, so it has not officially approved or rejected the Obama administration's proposal to increase the number of refugees to 110,000 in FY 2017.The Department of State and the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which together run the federal refugee resettlement program, are operating under the budget authority of the ten week interim budget that funds the federal government from October 1 to December 9. During this period, it seems clear that they, in concert with the resettlement agencies, intend to bring in as many refugees as possible, including to small cities and states that have previously not been forced to accept a high number of refugees.West Virginia has only gotten a very small number of refugees ever since this program was established in 1980, but all that could change if Episcopal Migration Ministries joins Catholic Charities and begins to place Syrian and other refugees from the Middle East and Africa in the state capital.

The first paragraph hedges a bit, reporting that Bibi ""may well prefer Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the upcoming presidential elections"" (emphasis added).The fact that Netanyahu prefers Clinton to Obama is hardly news, and has been written about extensively. Former Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Michael Oren, for example, wrote in his 2015 memoir, Ally: My Journey Across the American-Israeli Divide, that Netanyahu and Clinton had an ""easy rapport,"" as compared to the rest of the Obama administration. That rapport was sorely tested when Clinton berated Netanyahu on the telephone for about 45 minutes over a construction project in a Jewish neighborhood of Jerusalem, carrying out President Barack Obama's orders to create public ""distance"" with Israel.In the Eizenstat email itself, there is evidence that Netanyahu is actually worried about what a Clinton administration might mean for Israel. In one paragraph, Eizenstat reports to the Clinton campaign:He attended part of the Saban Forum and felt that most of the emphasis was on the Palestinian issue, and wonders if a Clinton Administration ""will be a Saban Forum for four years"", due to ""the people around her, but not her"". Her own speech was ""95% good, although there was some moral equivalence language.""The vast majority of American Jews vote Democratic, and Hillary Clinton enjoys a good relationship with many Jewish community leaders, as well as the support of key opinion-makers. However, she has no actual pro-Israel achievements to her name, even after decades of public life, and in fact has done several things to damage Israel's cause.Donald Trump recently had a successful meeting with Netanyahu in New York, focusing on shared interest in border security.Joel B.

However, President Barack Obama is reportedly unlikely to make such a move.""At odds with Washington over Syria and Ukraine, Russia has engaged in a bout of saber-rattling in recent weeks, moving S-300 surface-to-air missiles to Tartus, nuclear-capable missiles to its European exclave of Kaliningrad, and reinforcing its Syria strike force,"" reports Reuters.""Leonid Slutsky, a senior [Russian] parliamentarian, told RIA its [Tartus] capacity would be expanded and it would be equipped with anti-submarine defenses and new electronics systems on top of the S-300 missiles it recently received,"" notes AFP.""Moscow also sent three missile ships to reinforce its naval forces off the coast of the conflict-wracked nation,"" adds AFP.U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), which is in charge of military operations in Latin America and the Caribbean, has expressed concern about Russia's expanding presence in the Western Hemisphere in an annual report submitted to Congress in recent years, including 2016.Last week, Russia said it was weighing reopening Soviet-era bases in Vietnam and Cuba.According to SOUTHCOM, Russia has already established military agreements for ""simplified port access and logistical support"" with the Central American country of Nicaragua, where it is reportedly considering constructing a base.Through the state-owned Russia Today (RT) media outlet, SOUTHCOM warns, Moscow is disseminating anti-American propaganda and in some instances fueling the anti-U.S. sentiment that already exists in Ecuador, Argentina, and Venezuela, the last of which is another country where Russia is reportedly looking to construct a base.Russia also uses its online news and Sputnik Mundo to spread anti-American propaganda targeted at Latin American audiences, adds the U.S. military, noting that ""Russia uses this media to create doubts about U.S. intentions and criticize U.S. policies.""The anti-American government of Venezuela has long refused to cooperate with the United States on combating terrorism and other threats in the region.Russia and Iran, including the Iranian narco-terrorist proxy Hezbollah, have kept the regime of Syrian Dictator Bashar al-Assad in operation. The U.S. State Department and SOUTHCOM have warned that both Iran and Hezbollah are also operating in Latin America, particularly in Venezuela.SOUTHCOM reported to lawmakers earlier this year:In this part of the world [Latin America, Caribbean], Russia's actions are directly connected to its broader global efforts to demonstrate that Russia is a global power capable of challenging U.S. leadership and the established rules-based international system.

Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) said Monday that Speaker of the House Paul Ryan was ""cowardly"" for announcing that he would not defend Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, and would not campaign for his election.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERRyan made his announcement on a conference call with fellow members of the Republican caucus on Monday morning, just hours after Trump had turned in a strong debate performance against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in St. Louis on Sunday night.""Leaders are supposed to stand firm and solid in moments of crisis,"" Rohrabacher told the Orange County Register. ""Instead, he's in a panic. It's not good leadership. ... I think the Republicans who are backing away are gutless. We don't have to just be concerned about saving House seats. We have to be concerned about saving the United States of America."" Other Republican congressmen from Orange County have been critical of Trump's comments but none has withdrawn their political support.Ryan still technically supports Trump for president, but is seeking to insulate members of his caucus from efforts by their Democratic challengers to tie them to Trump's latest controversy.In some districts, the danger is real, and precedes the latest Trump controversy. In others, Republicans simply seem to be caught up in the panic of a media frenzy. Similar panic did not help Republicans, even pro-choice ones, when Democrats tried to tie them to abortion remarks by Rep. Todd Akin in 2012.On Monday afternoon, Fox News contributor Charles Krauthammer noted on Special Report that Ryan's announcement, so soon after Trump was perceived by many to have won the debate, ""ripped off the bandage"" and hurt Trump's attempt to keep the party together.Trump's response to Ryan was to tweet that he was wasting his time on political infighting instead of doing his job:Paul Ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting Republican nominee-- Donald J.

We are used to it and it's one of Iran's laws and we accept it,"" she said.The US champion has launched a petition calling for the tournament to be moved.""I think it's unacceptable to host a Women's World Championship in a place where women do not have basic fundamental rights and are treated as second-class citizens,"" the 22-year-old Georgian-American wrote on Instagram.Her petition has been backed by some leading figures in chess, including Nigel Short, the British coach who once trained Iran's national team.Under Iranian law, women can only show their face, hands and feet in public and are supposed to wear only modest colours.Over the years, women have pushed back the boundaries of the law, with many, particularly in the capital, wearing loose, brightly coloured headscarves far back on their heads.But they still risk fines and even lashings from ""morality police"" if they go too far.The head of Iran's chess federation, Mehrdad Pahlevanzadeh, said the calls for a boycott were unreasonable.""Everywhere in the world, there are rules on how to cover your body. There is no place in the world where people can wear nothing in public,"" he told AFP.The head of the World Chess Federation (FIDE), Geoffrey Borg, expressed surprise at the boycott campaign, saying federation members had not expressed ""the slightest objection"" when Iran was selected as host.""Chess players should respect the laws of countries,"" Borg told a Tehran press conference last week.""The only objections have been on personal pages, for which FIDE is not responsible,"" Iranian media quoted him as saying.- 'Don't isolate Iran' -Khademalsharieh and Hejazipour said the interests of Iranian women were better served by engagement with the world than by boycotts.She pointed to the example of karate, in which women were previously banned from competing in the hijab.""Now (women wearing the hijab) are allowed and they are getting some medals and I think this helps Iranian women more than isolating the country,"" said Khademalsharieh.The chess world championship in Tehran is due to feature 64 players from 26 countries, including three from Iran, with the winner receiving $60,000.So far, Paikidze-Barnes is the only selected player to announce a boycott.""I am not anti-Islam or any other religion,"" the US champion wrote on Instagram. ""I'm protesting... not because of Iran's religion or people, but for the government's laws that are restricting my rights as a woman.""Pahlevanzadeh said the Iranian chess federation had never faced any problem hosting previous tournaments -- including the women's Grand Prix held in Iran earlier this year.""We have organised many tournaments for women before.

It also makes a political statement in support of women generally, and the Democratic Party in particular.""We thought it'd be a great idea with all the political things going on--with Clinton being such a woman and the other guy and his womanizing,"" Alony said.The SoHo pharmacy posted two signs in the store's front windows Monday announcing the new policy. A pink sign in one window reads, ""New store policy: All Female Customers Shop Tax Free,"" while a blue sign in the other window, reads ""All Male Customers Are Subject to a 7% Man Tax.""She also referred to the so-called ""pink tax,"" the extra amount women are reportedly charged for certain products or services, such as dry cleaning, personal care products and car maintenance. Added to income disparity, Alony said, the pink tax places an undue burden on women that needs to be rectified.""We wanted to share that women deserve to get a break, and men deserve to be charged 7 percent more. Women are spending more in general and we make less, so we deserve to have a break,"" Alony said.Last year, the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs released a study claiming that products marketed to women in New York cost on average 7 percent more than equivalent products marketed to men, which explains Alony's choice of a 7 percent tax for men.Alony said she has already received wildly varied reactions to her signs announcing the man tax, which were posted Monday. While some couples have found the sign entertaining, others ""were a little upset about it, saying, 'Fuck you,' 'You're being a sexist,' and to get a lawyer,"" Alony reported.""We live in a big world, and I think we need to raise awareness,"" she said.Alony acknowledged that gender-based fees by a retail service establishment is a violation of New York City pricing laws, so she is not sure how long the ploy will last.In reality, she said, the pharmacy is offering a 7 percent discount for women--effectively cutting out sales tax--rather than charging men more. Alony is reportedly paying the women's sales tax out of her own pocket.The pharmacy has not explained whether it will tax transgender males under the new policy.Follow Thomas D.

""We hope we can ask you to ratify these documents soon.""Moscow already has a permanent air base in Syria from which it flies air strikes against anti-Assad rebels and uses military trainers, special forces, marines and artillery specialists to help support Syrian government forces on the ground.Senator Morozov said that having a permanent naval base as well would allow Russia to operate more ships in the Mediterranean as they would have an enhanced facility where they could refuel and resupply.Moscow inherited the Tartus facility when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 and it is now the Russian navy's sole foothold in the Mediterranean. Despite some modernisation, it is currently fairly modest and unable to welcome larger warships.Leonid Slutsky, a senior parliamentarian, told RIA its capacity would be expanded and it would be equipped with anti-submarine defences and new electronics systems on top of the S-300 missiles it recently received.

We are very pleased that Iran is coming back to be a part of the global community. But it is still a fragile situation,"" he added, according to Shana.Iran's Deputy Oil Minister Amir Hossein Zamaninia described the initial agreement as a ""very significant step for the start of the Shell company's involvement in Iran's petrochemical industry, which we hope will be operational very soon.""Marzieh Shahdaei, the head of the NPC, told Shana that the company planned to increase petrochemical output to 160 million tonnes from 60 million by 2025.Foreign businesses have rushed to cash in on last year's historic accord with world powers that saw sanctions lifted in exchange for curbs to Iran's nuclear program.Zamaninia told Shana that Iran was pursuing $10 billion worth of deals in the oil and gas sector this year.However, remaining US sanctions mean international banks are still wary of doing business with Iran -- making it difficult for firms to finance major deals.Nijkamp acknowledged the difficulties for transferring funds, but told Shana: ""The fact that I am here today means that we do see a very positive future for Iran and also for Shell in Iran.""Shell, which was forced by sanctions to cease trade with Iran in 2010, resumed purchases of Iranian oil in June.SIGN UP"	[]	[]

He added that some of the detainees weren't suspected of taking part in the attacks, but were relatives of militants who had gone into hiding ""and can be used to provide useful information as well as send them a message that we mean business. We will not let Gaza become an IS launching pad.""Radical Islamists have repeatedly challenged Hamas' central authority by goading Israel into attacking Hamas targets, which has inflicted heavy losses on the struggling Gaza government.Speaking to Breitbart Jerusalem, a Salafi source said that the arrests included raids on homes of Salafi activists and their friends and relatives, saying that it wasn't simply a punitive measure against the attackers but an attempt to collect intelligence about members of jihadi groups.""Many of the activists are former members of other organizations, including Hamas,"" he said.

Zinke: Trump â€˜Should Be Ashamedâ€™ of Lewd Talk, but is Preferable to Hillary Clinton	"The Republican congressman from Montana told Breitbart News Monday that he is very disturbed by the lewd tape of Donald J. Trump, but still supports his party's nominee for president.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""What Mr. Trump said was wrong,"" said Rep. Ryan Zinke (R.-Mont.). ""There is no other way to say it. He should be ashamed. But, that doesn't make Hillary any better a candidate.""""What we face everyday is a bureaucracy that's grown out of control, a government that have become separated and is no longer held accountable to the people,"" he said. ""This is a unique election in the history of our country.""""As much as anything else, this is a people's election-that's really the essence of the Trump candidacy,"" he said.""It's the rise of Americans, who are angry at signs that they see the greatness of America fading and they not longer have trust for the government,"" he said.Clinton represents the political elite that is telling Americans that their concerns are trivial, said the retired Navy SEAL officer. ""She's the one who said it is OK to have a public position and say something else in private-that is exactly what is wrong with our government,"" Zinke said.The congressman said he was not on the conference call with Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R.-Wis.), when Ryan said he would not defend or campaign with Trump.On the call, Ryan told the congressmen to look out for themselves and not to feel loyalty to Trump.The combat veteran of the war in Iraq, who was the acting commander of more than 3,000 special operations personnel at Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force-Arabian Peninsula, said he knew nothing whatsoever about plans rumored to have been originated with the speaker replace Trump from the top of the ticket with Indiana Gov. Michael Pence, who is Trump's vice-presidential running mate.Although, Zinke said he still supports Trump, he understands members of Congress, who feel they have to represent their own districts.""Sometimes representing your district is more important that representing your party,"" he said. ""In Montana, Trump won soundly, but so did Bernie Sanders,"" he said. The Treasure State primary was held June 7 with Trump taking 74 percent of the vote.
