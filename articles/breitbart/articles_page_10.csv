Mitt Romney and quite a bit better than Sen. John McCain, but it was Clinton's loss of Obama's voters outside the cities that cost her the election.That loss came as Clinton and her team tried to run up in the score from her core metropolitan demographics, including ethnic minorities, gays, immigrants, university educated women and professionals. Clinton ""was really, really hyper-focused on urban communities,"" Steve Schale, a Florida Democratic strategist told The Hill.The tallying of votes continues and the final count won't be official for weeks to come, but current totals seem to show that Clinton underperformed Obama's finals by some five million votes. More importantly, Clinton lost major support in the very states she needed in order to reach the required 270 Electoral College votes.According to the review, Clinton lost crucial support in rural and collar counties in Pennsylvania, Florida, Ohio, Michigan, and other states that were once assumed to be automatically in her Democratic column. In Pennsylvania, for instance, Clinton outperformed Obama in only one of the state's 36 counties with populations of 100,000 or less.Meanwhile, Trump far outperformed Romney in those same counties, which served as a counterbalance to Clinton's wins in the big urban areas. It was all thanks to a major swing by voters once known as Reagan Democrats.""The Reagan Democrat coalition moved his way pretty strongly in some of these places, or they just didn't vote for her,"" Mark Stephenson, a Republican data analytics expert, told The Hill. ""You can have 10 counties that make up 1 percent of the vote that overwhelm a big county that makes up 8 percent of the vote, and that seems to be what happened in a lot of these swing states.""Trump even outperformed in Florida's non-metropolitan areas, counterbalancing Clinton's win in urban centers. The review of votes found Clinton bested Trump by 853,000 votes in the five most populous counties, which Obama only won by 695,000 votes in 2012.But Trump slammed Clinton in the rest of the state, ultimately winning by about 220,000 votes.The study found similar outcomes in several of the other ""blue wall"" states. In fact, she was so sure she would win them that in some cases she spent little time campaigning there.The Hill report ultimately finds that Clinton didn't do badly in the solid Democrat regions of the country. It was everywhere else, purple and red area alike, where she utterly failed.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.SIGN UP"

During the meeting the Vice President-elect reiterated President-elect Donald J. Trump's strong commitment to repeal and replace Obamacare and block grant Medicaid funding to state governments to encourage innovation that better delivers healthcare to eligible residents.

The meeting concluded with the Vice President-elect asking the governors to reach out directly to him as together they work on important issues impacting their states and our nation.The commitment from Pence that a Trump presidential administration will follow through on campaign promises comes as some have suggested that Trump could soften on those promises.During a Sunday night 60 Minutes interview Trump suggested his administration would attempt to keep certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act such as coverage of pre-existing conditions and adult children remaining on their parents' insurance. Trump did suggested that these items increase cost, but that an effort would be made to retain them in light of repealing and replacing current President Barack Obama's signature health insurance law. Forbes wrote out a portion of the transcript from that interview. When interviewer Leslie Stahl asked about a lag between repealing and replacing, Trump simply said that the two will be done simultaneously and no lag would occur.One of Trump's signature campaign promises was to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and enforce U.S. immigration law.

Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, Reince PriebusThe corrupt mainstream media had no problem with Obama's nutcase Rev. Jeremiah Wright, who preached political hatred against America and the Jews.The corrupt media had no problem with Obama's mentor terrorist killer Bill Ayers.But on Sunday the entire mainstream media began attacking Stephen Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart News and Trump's chief strategist.The New York Times called Steve Bannon the ""Voice of Racism"" in their latest headline.I know Steve Bannon and he is not a racist, sexist, Jew-hater, or homophobe.The media is lying to you again.Back in August 2013, I came down with a sepsis bacterial attack that nearly killed me. I suffered five strokes, had major heart damage, lost vision in one eye, lost a knee to infection and nearly died.During this very difficult time Steve Bannon, Larry Solov, and the late Mike Flynn reached out to my assistant and volunteered to keep The Gateway Pundit going until I was well enough to start writing again. Steve Bannon is a class act.Steve Bannon even ran a tribute for me on Breitbart News Sunday on SiriusXM asking for prayers and support during my time of need. That was Breitbart. That was Steve Bannon.Over the years Steve has been very kind, respectful, and generous to me. Steve and Larry awarded me the Breitbart Award for journalism in 2015.Steve Bannon also kept the vision of Breitbart News alive and shattered company traffic records in October, generating over 240 million pageviews and 37 million unique visitors.Out of the tens of thousands of posts on Breitbart.com, the left cherry-picked 5-10 questionable posts to attack Steve Bannon.Steve had nothing to do with these cherry-picked posts.Steve Bannon does not have a racist or sexist or homophobic bone in his body.I congratulate Steve Bannon for his many successes and for his appointment on Sunday as Donald Trump's head of Strategy.

Bannon, was brought in to run the general election campaign. Trump on Sunday named Bannon chief strategist and senior counselor for his administration.Breitbart is planning a move into more spacious Washington offices, looking to add reporters in Germany, France, the Middle East and Asia, wants to add coverage of the media and technology to its conservative-framed news and hopes to produce more video, said Alexander Marlow, the site's editor in chief, on Monday. Its own cable network is a dream, but unlikely now, he said.""We're going to be the best place for news on the Trump White House,"" Marlow said. ""That is my intention and I have no reason to think that's not a fully attainable goal. I think a lot of the mainstream media already consider that the expectation and they're none too happy about it, which of course is a delight to me.""ComScore reported that Breitbart had 19.2 million unique visitors to its site in October, the most ever for the service founded in 2007 by Andrew Breitbart, a Los Angeles man intent on offering a conservative view on politics and the media. Breitbart died of heart failure in 2012 at age 43, opening the door for Bannon's rise as top executive.The site adopted Trump as a champion as his campaign took off. There were objections from those who considered Trump not conservative enough, and Breitbart lost staff members last spring when it failed to back its own reporter after she was roughed up by then-Trump campaign chief Corey Lewandowski.Among the site's headlines Monday: House minority leader Nancy Pelosi ""continues to lead Democrats to glorious defeat""; ""Anti-democracy crybabies march by thousands nationwide""; and ""Dow Jones had best week since 2011 due to Trump win."" A column on Trump's new appointment was headlined: ""Stephen K. Bannon, friend of the Jewish people, defender of Israel.""""Breitbart will continue to be what it has been during the campaign -- it was just a propaganda arm for Donald Trump,"" said Kurt Bardella, a public relations consultant who dropped Breitbart as a client this spring following the incident with reporter Michelle Fields and Lewandowski. ""This is as close as we're ever going to be to having a state-sponsored media entity that will effectively be operating out of the West Wing.""Bardella said he believed Breitbart was on a path to being a more serious news organization before embracing Trump.Ben Shapiro, a former Breitbart editor who also left following last spring and is now editor of the Daily Wire site, said he can't imagine Bannon not continuing to have input on what Breitbart publishes.""The site will continue to be popular, although they could run into trouble if Trump decides to move away from the populist right and they're stuck shilling for him,"" Shapiro said.Bannon has been on a leave of absence from Breitbart since he began running the Trump campaign, and Breitbart said he will take steps to leave the company in accord with government rules when he takes the White House job. Marlow said Bannon has had no formal communications with the company, although he said he talked to him Wednesday. ""He gave me a couple of war stories and I gave him a big hug,"" he said.Marlow said Breitbart wouldn't be afraid to criticize Trump if he strays from the populist message that got him elected.He said Breitbart doesn't just have readers, it has fans; one of the first things visitors see on the site is a line of merchandise for sale. The dismissal of its readers as haters ""was really rejected by the voters, who are much more savvy, much more sophisticated and much more informed than a lot of people at CNN think they are,"" he said.But some of Breitbart's reputation comes from headlines that some readers could easily find offensive: ""Birth control makes women unattractive and crazy"" and ""The solution to online harassment is simple: women should log off.""Bannon was quoted before leaving Breitbart that he considered the site ""the platform for the alt-right"" -- a movement often associated with far-right efforts to preserve ""white identity,"" oppose multiculturalism and defend ""Western values.""""I've never made an editorial decision based on whether the alt-right would like it or not,"" Marlow said. ""I don't consider myself part of the alt-right. If I am, I don't even know it.""The implication is that we're OK with racism and bigotry and we're absolutely not,"" he said.SIGN UP"
5	http://www.breitbart.com/2nd-amendment/2016/11/14/six-great-concealed-carry-pistols-for-your-christmas-wish-list/	Six Great Concealed Carry Pistols for Your Christmas Wish List	"With Black Friday quickly approaching and gun sales on an 18-month record breaking streak, Breitbart News believes the timing is right to point out six great concealed carry pistols for your Christmas list.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBeing pistols, the guns on the following list all share one thing in common-they are semiautomatics. Beyond that, some are very compact and light and hold only a few rounds-seven or eight-and others,while still compact, are a bit larger and consequently hold twice as many rounds as their smaller counterparts.Regardless of the size and caliber that most appeals to you, another common thread with the guns below is their dependability. They are extremely reliable firearms, and all of them have found mass appeal among concealed carry permit holders around the country.Glock 43 (9mm)-The Glock 43 is a single stack handgun that holds six rounds of 9mm in the magazine and one in the chamber. So that's 6+1, for a total of seven rounds of hollow point +P ammunition at the ready (in cities/states where such ammunition isn't illegal). The 43 is pure Glock through and through, which means it is durable beyond belief, easy to use, and very comfortable to carry. The 43 is 6.26 inches long, 1.02 inches wide, and weighs 17.9 ounces. Like all Glocks, it has no external thumb safety. The safety is built in the trigger via Glock's ""Safe Action"" system and is released when pressure is applied to trigger.Approximate price for a Glock 43 -- $500 to $580.Smith & Wesson M&P Shield (9mm)-The Shield is similar in size to the 43, but holds one more round of 9mm. It is a 7+1 gun (8+1 with the secondary magazine.) The trade-off is 3 more ounces in weight. The Shield weighs 20.8 ounces. The Shield's trigger operates in a manner similar to Glock's in that it prevents the gun from firing if dropped or slapped around. The safety in the trigger is disengaged when the trigger is depressed, thus allowing the weapon to fire. The Shield can be acquired with an optional external thumb saftey. Like the Glock 43, the Shield is very concealable, easy to use, and comfortable to carry.Approximate price for a M&P Shield -$450.Glock 42 (.380)-The Glock 42 holds six rounds of .380 ammunition plus one in the chamber (6+1). It is smaller than the model 43 and lighter, with the trade-off being that the 42 shoots a .380 instead of a 9mm. The 42 is 4.92 inches long, .94 inches wide, and weighs 13.76 ounces. The 42 is a great concealed carry gun for women because of the lighter recoil, but it has proven popular with men and women alike. It is extremely light-therefore comfortable to carry-and is easy to use. It also has Glock dependability on its side. Kimber Micro Carry (.380)-The Kimber Micro Carry is a standout in the .380 market. Although ultra-compact, the gun handles and functions like a full size 1911 handgun. And it shoots bigger than it is. In other words, it shoots as if it were a much larger gun with a much longer barrel. Its accuracy is sublime. The Micro Carry weighs 14.8 ounces and holds seven rounds of .380 in the magazine plus one in the chamber (7+1). Unlike the previous guns in this list, the Micro Carry is a single action pistol, which means it has a hammer that must be cocked in order to fire the first bullet. The hammer can be cocked by racking the slide or by pulling the hammer to the cocked position with your thumb. This feature-a classic aspect of 1911 pistols-affords the person carrying the gun an added sense of safety against accidental discharge.Approximate price for a Kimber Micro Carry (the Two-Tone model was tested) -- $650.Sig Sauer P238 (.380)-The Sig Sauer P238 is a .380 handgun similar to the Kimber Micro in that it operates from a single action platform. It is very compact at 5.5 inches in length, 1.1 inches in width, and 15.2 ounces unloaded. It has an external thumb safety and holds six rounds of .380 ammunition in the magazine and one in the chamber (6+1). The diminutive size of the P238 makes it a great gun for women who plan to carry a gun in their purse or bag instead of on their person. And the external safety can provide added peace of mind against an accidental discharge.Approximate price for Sig Sauer P238 is $680.Glock 19 (9mm)-The Glock 19 is a proven workhorse. It is not as small or light as the other pistols on this list, but carries the added benefit of more rounds; it ships with 15-round magazines. That is 16 rounds total or 15+1. The 19 is 7.36 inches long, 1.36 inches wide, and weighs 23.65 ounces unloaded. Like the other Glocks in this list it has no external safety. Rather, the trigger has a safety incorporated into it that allows the gun to fire as soon as it is depressed. The Glock 19 is one of the most enduring 9mm handguns on the market.The Glock 19 costs approximately $550.The key to any of these guns is finding the one that fits your hand and one that you can physically and easily conceal. If you live in a climate that allows you to comfortably carry a gun inside the waistband, Clinger Holsters make one of the best inside the waistband holsters available. If you plan to carry outside the waistband-under a shirt, for instance, or in an open carry state-Alien Gear Holsters are incredible.Whatever holster and gun combo you choose, the key is to familiarize yourself with your firearm and the laws of your state, then carry the gun everyday and everywhere you can. The gun has to be with you in order to be used by you in defense of your life and liberty.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of ""Bullets with AWR Hawkins,"" a Breitbart News podcast.

Bannon to President-elect Donald Trump's upcoming White House staff.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERDuring his Monday, November 14 broadcast, Boston-based radio talker Howie Carr asked the firebrand In Trump We Trust author what she thought of the recent decision to put on his staff both current GOP chairman Reince Priebus and the man the media seems to fear most, Stephen Bannon.""I think it's quite brilliant,"" Coulter said. ""I'm very impressed with Trump and this decision.""She continued noting that the chief of staff job was likely not very appealing to Bannon. ""A lot of what the chief of staff does,"" Coulter said, ""is administrative stuff. He has to make sure the lights are working, everybody gets an office space assigned, the secretaries are working with the right [person]... there's a lot of the administrative stuff that frankly we don't want Steve Bannon wasting his time on.""""Steve Bannon will be the ideas guy and Reince Priebus will be the official representative and he can go on the Sunday morning shows and he can make sure the heat's on,"" Coulter insisted.For his part, Carr thought that a ""co-counsel"" was not a good idea. But Coulter didn't read it that way.I don't know the details, but it seems to me the roles [of Bannon and Priebus] are fairly distinct. One is the administrative guy, the organization man, and the other one is the ideas guy. Basically the way its seems to have worked during the campaign and that seems to work pretty well... Bannon is definitely the idea man.Coulter also noted that the way the left is importing millions of illegals to vote in our elections, should this election have happened four years from now, Trump's concerns about illegal immigration would have meant a sure electoral loss.In a discussion on what Trump may or may not do about federal abortion laws, Coulter praised the basic building blocks of our nation by noting that the brilliance of America is that we can decide on a local level how we want to craft our society.This is why we have democracy, this is part of the beauty of our federalist society. The beauty part of federalism is people can design the kind of place they would like to live in. If you consider it intolerable to live in a state -- there probably won't be too many, Kansas, Mississippi -- that, by and large, largely prohibits abortion except in the case of life of the mother, which has always been the case. OK, don't live in that state. There are probably a lot of laws you're not going to like in a state like that. You don't have to up and move to another country, you don't have to found your own country, or start seasteading or something. That's the beauty of democracy, there are a lot of laws you may not like, but the more you can break it down to the smaller unit, whether it's local government or state government, the more likely you are to be happy with that complement of laws.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.I don't know the details, but it seems to me the roles [of Bannon and Priebus] are fairly distinct.

7	http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/11/14/donald-trump-can-begin-dismantle-obamacare-day-one/	How Donald Trump Can Begin to Dismantle Obamacare on Day One	"Even as a GOP-led Congress irons out its own plans for the repeal and replacement of Obamacare, President Donald Trump could begin the demise of Barack Obama's signature healthcare law on the very first day of his presidency.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERWriting at Forbes, Seth Chandler of George Mason University's Mercatus Center says that Obamacare's heavy reliance on the executive branch's ""rulemaking"" will allow Trump to use his office and his own ""pen"" to dismantle several of the healthcare law's major parts while Congress designs its own bill to undo Obamacare and replace it with free-market legislation.Chandler writes:In particular, President Trump should be able to bring Obamacare to its knees on day one simply by stopping payment on something known as ""Cost Sharing Reductions [CSR]."" If and when he does so, insurers will start pulling out of the Exchanges for the 2017 benefit year and it is not clear how many will re-enter even assuming Obamacare persists.CSRs are payments the federal government makes to health insurance companies that provide mid-level ""silver"" plans to Obamacare customers.Chandler observes Obama has been ""paying the multi-billion dollar [CSR] bill"" out of an appropriation that is supposed to go to tax refunds, which CSR is not.""He adds:There's been a lawsuit pending in the courts (House v. Burwell) about whether this action by the President violates separation of powers. But, regardless of whether the President may fund cost sharing reductions, it's a brutal legal argument to say that he must do so. And it would take years of litigation to force a reluctant President to do so. So, on January 20, 2017, President Trump can stop billions of dollars of funding for the ACA that keeps the program alive.Insight into CSRs shows one of the main reasons why health insurance companies got in bed with the Obama administration in the first place on the ACA. Without this federal funding, insurers would suffer considerable financial losses on the silver-level policies.""I doubt many insurers set their rates expect[ing] CSR payments to go away,"" Chandler explains. ""Once CSR payments are stopped, expect many, many insurers to exit the exchanges and cancel their policies in fairly short order.""Cato Institute healthcare expert Michael F. Cannon agrees that Trump - even prior to taking office - ""could announce that the subsidies [CSR] that a federal judge has ruled violate the Constitution"" will terminate.""He could say, 'We're going to respect that judge's ruling, we're not going to appeal that ruling,' and that the subsidies are going to end on this date...,"" Cannon explains in a podcast. ""So, insurance companies are not going to be getting those billions of dollars.""Chandler and Cannon also agree that Trump can make clear that reinsurance payments to insurers are going to stop as well, especially since the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has said these payments are illegally being diverted to insurers.Reinsurance payments protect insurers from excessive medical costs. In 2015, the Obama administration even raised reinsurance payouts to insurers that offer ACA-compliant plans to individual Americans. These insurers have agreed to insure some of the sicker Obamacare customers.""Again, there is a legal dispute as to whether the President even has had the power to be paying insurance companies this money while stiffing the United States...But it is going to be very hard to argue that the President must make these payments,"" Chandler writes.Cannon says Trump could also vigorously fight the lawsuits brought against the federal government by the health insurers - who want to get even more money out of the federal government - instead of just settling them, as the Obama administration has suggested it would.Trump could also say the exemption Congress has been getting from Obamacare will end on January 20, 2017, Cannon suggests as well.""By ending these illegal bailouts, and the illegal exemption Congress got from Obamacare, it will build a lot of pressure in Congress to do something,"" he says.In particular, President Trump should be able to bring Obamacare to its knees on day one simply by stopping payment on something known as ""Cost Sharing Reductions [CSR]."" If and when he does so, insurers will start pulling out of the Exchanges for the 2017 benefit year and it is not clear how many will re-enter even assuming Obamacare persists.There's been a lawsuit pending in the courts (House v. Burwell) about whether this action by the President violates separation of powers.

Klein released the following statement on Monday:SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIt is painful to see Anti-Defamation League (ADL) president Jonathan Greenblatt engaging in character assassination against President-elect Trump's appointee Stephen Bannon and Mr. Bannon's company, Breitbart media.  ADL/Greenblatt essentially accused Mr. Bannon and his media company of ""anti-Semitism"" and Israel hatred, when Jonathan Greenblatt/ADL tweeted that Bannon ""presided over the premier website of the 'alt right' - a loose-knit group of white nationalists and anti-Semites.""In fact, as pro-Israel writer (and orthodox Jew) Joel B. Pollak wrote, Mr. Bannon is ""an American patriot who defends Israel & has deep empathy for the Jewish people.""ZOA's own experience and analysis of Breitbart articles confirms Mr. Bannon's and Breitbart's friendship and fair-mindedness towards Israel and the Jewish people.  To accuse Mr. Bannon and Breitbart of anti-Semitism is Orwellian.  In fact, Breitbart bravely fights against anti-Semitism.  Here are a few of the many examples:Stephen Bannon joined ZOA in fighting the anti-Semitic rallies at CUNY by requiring his Breitbart reporters to call CUNY officials and Gov. Cuomo aides urging them to do something about it.Breitbart courageously publishes articles reporting that the Palestinian Authority defames Israel with blatant falsehoods.  On November 13, 2016, Breitbart reported that:""The Palestinian Authority's official TV network has been airing a video several times a day baselessly accusing Israel of poisoning former PA President Yasser Arafat and further claiming that Israel is targeting current President Mahmoud Abbas next.  Arafat died at the age of 75 on November 11, 2004, just outside of Paris. A French forensic team examined his remains and concluded that there were no traces of poison in his body.  Nevertheless, every year around the anniversary of his death, the PA disseminates the libel that Israel murdered him.""  (Emphasis in original.)On November 14, 2016 Breitbart reported the human cost and pain to a Jewish student at the New School of finding a swastika scrawled on her dorm room door.Breitbart bravely publicizes Iran's violations of the Iran deal - which pose an existential threat to Israel.  On November 13, 2016, Breitbart reported that ""Despite a finding published by the UN's atomic energy agency this week that Iran has -- for the second time -- stockpiled more heavy water than permitted under the terms of the nuclear agreement it reached with six world powers last year, the US State Department is declining to acknowledge this as a violation of the deal.""Breitbart also sympathetically reports on the scourge of anti-Semitic anti-Israel boycotts, divestment and sanctions (BDS).  On November 2, 2016, Breitbart reported that:  ""Reports of anti-Semitic incidents on US college campuses have increased, much of it attributed to the rise of the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, a new report has found.""ZOA President Morton Klein stated:  ""The ZOA welcomes the appointment of Stephen Bannon as chief strategist to the incoming Trump/Pence administration.  We wish Mr. Bannon every success in his new position.  We urge Jonathan Greenblatt/ADL to withdraw and apologize for their inappropriate character assassination of Mr. Bannon and Breitbart Media.""Would Trump's extraordinary pro-Israel advisors such as Newt Gingrich, Rudy Giuliani, Mike Pence, Sheldon Adelson, and Orthodox Jews Jared Kushner, David Friedman, and Jason Greenblatt ever allow an anti-Semite/Israel-hater to work with them? Would Trump's Orthodox Jewish daughter Ivanka, whose children go to an Orthodox day school, ever allow an anti-Semite to work with her father? And, remember Donald Trump's platform on Israel was the strongest pro-Israel platform ever. I'm also forced to ask - why didn't ADL and other Bannon bashers complain that Hilary's advisers included some very anti-Israel people starting with major donor to Hillary, the Israel-hating, George Soros? Where were ADL's complaints then?SIGN UP"

He also noted that while Speaker Ryan may not have been ""listening to the voices of the forgotten and downtrodden American workers,"" some conservative members of Congress were paying attention and have struggled to ""to carry that message to the elites and media in D.C. who have, until now, paid no attention to what those voices had to say.""""Speaker Ryan says that Trump has 'earned a mandate' from the American people.

""Republicans have led the House for six years.

""'The Better Way' is a very rational set of policy prescriptions put forward by Speaker Ryan, a policy expert, but our leadership has acknowledged that Trump saw something they missed. The 'Better Way' agenda has been in play for a year now- yet Trump saw something new.

If we rush this Speaker election, the American people will feel manipulated once again. This is no time to undermine morale and do an end-run around them.Brat concluded: ""From our leadership, I ask for clear, unambiguous answers on how they will pursue the agenda the American people voted for. I am happy to vote for anyone who does so. I will not vote for anyone who does not have this agenda on paper for the American people to see. That is what the people I represent demand and deserve.""Conservatives have noted that Ryan's personal policy agenda was ""rejected"" on November 8th- particularly his views on immigration, trade and crime. According to polling data, Ryan's open borders vision on immigration and trade is opposed by roughly 9 in 10 GOP voters.It is unclear whether members of the House Freedom Caucus and conservative lawmakers--including Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows, Jeff Duncan, Jim Bridenstine, Brian Babin, Steve King, Matt Salmon, Alex Mooney, Gary Palmer, Barry Loudermilk, John Fleming and others--who voted for Ryan last year, will vote to elect him again as House Speaker on Tuesday.Disclosure: Julia Hahn used to work as a press staffer in Rep.

The Dow opened at 18,914.78.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFox Business saw it as the capper on the Dow's ""best week since 2011,"" and found investors optimistic that Trump would fulfill ""campaign promises to simplify regulation in the health and financial sectors and boost spending on infrastructure.""By Monday afternoon, the forces of market gravity began to reassert themselves. Fox Business pointed out that tech giants Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft - none of them widely viewed as cars on the Trump Train - were holding the Nasdaq down, while ""stock markets around the world were affected by a continued selloff in the global bond market as investors looked for more clarity regarding Trump's policies.""The bond market was portrayed as nervous about a potential Trump ""spending binge.""""The prospect of higher inflation due to higher fiscal spending under the Trump administration has caused bonds to sell off and while higher inflation is good for the U.S. economy in the long run, it is seen as a negative factor in the short term because this market is used to near zero interest rates,"" explained Peter Cardillo, chief market economist for First Standard Financial.Reuters weighed in on Monday afternoon and claimed that Nasdaq tech stocks were ""under pressure as investors pour more money in other sectors that are seen benefiting from Trump's policies.""Also, investors unexpectedly (to the media) buoyant by Trump's unexpected (to the media) victory are supposedly growing nervous because Trump hasn't provided enough specific details about his economic plans, and because they're worried he might not keep his election promises.Apparently they expected him to put a 500-point economic plan on the table Sunday afternoon, and have never before considered the possibility that an elected politician might fail to keep all of his campaign promises. Also, one can only wonder what sort of ""spending binge"" financial media expected if Hillary Clinton had won the election.A much more erudite analysis of the ""Trump rally"" was offered by Sven Henrich, founder of NorthmanTrader, to CNBC. In essence, he thinks some of the post-election rally was a ""bounce"" back from the market testing some dangerous lows right before the election, and the rally is unlikely to last because the tech titans are still pulling the market down.(CNBC adds, without attribution, that there is ""growing speculation that President-elect Trump's policies could hurt technology companies."")MarketWatch reported on the Trump rally ""losing steam"" Monday afternoon, but threw in optimistic projections from a few analysts:""There are a lot of people who are waiting to see the actualities of his proposals, because right now we only have the broad-brush outlines,"" said Mark Grant, chief fixed income strategist at Hilltop Securities, who added that he nonetheless expected the new administration's policies to help stock prices. ""I'm very bullish about the equity market right now,"" he said.[Allianz Global Investors investment strategist Kristina] Hooper was likewise upbeat on the market.""We would expect a somewhat upward bias to stocks in the near term. While valuations are stretched, there is significant positive sentiment to propel equities,"" she said.Over at CNN Money, on the other hand, dark speculations were floated that investors had become ""too complacent"" after just three business days of the Trump rally. (CNN Money was still in shock over the election, having become convinced the market really, really wanted Hillary Clinton to be President, and should have collapsed when she lost, instead of surging.)CNN Money speculates that fiscal doom could descend because Trump is using Twitter again (supposedly reminding investors of his volatility), because tech companies don't want to lose the foreign labor they've been importing through the H1-B visa program, because Trump and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos don't get along, because congressional Republicans may not be fully on board with Trump's agenda... and, as with every other piece written Monday about the Trump rally fading, because the President-Elect hasn't publicized enough details about his economic agenda.Strategist Tom DeMark told MarketWatch he expected the Trump rally to end with a peak and tumble, with values dropping by at least 11 percent.Appearing on Breitbart News Daily Monday morning, economist Peter Morici of the University of Maryland was unsurprised by the post-election market rally, and predicted investors would remain bullish on Trump until and unless he gives them a firm reason not to be:The thing is, we had a 'Trump scare' about two weeks before the election. People started to realize he could win, and the stocks went down. But you know, after a certain point, you step back and say, 'What would happen if we had a Trump presidency?' You know, we're not going to have as big a tax cut as he campaigned on, but we're gonna have a tax cut. We're not gonna ship back 11 million people, because we can't, physically. But we are going to have better border control, and likely an immigration policy that focuses on the needs of the economy, and the ability of people to assimilate.Beat Wittman of Porta Advisors took more of a wait-and-see attitude during an interview with CNBC, and suggested market performance during Trump's first months, and maybe first years, in office could be shaped by forces set in motion long before he came on the scene.""After 30 years of lower inflation and interest rates, we are going to head for reflation. That will be a bumpy road and we'll see in the next few days and weeks how this U.S. administration is going to tie up on stimulating domestic demand and running foreign relationships,"" said Wittmann.""There are a lot of people who are waiting to see the actualities of his proposals, because right now we only have the broad-brush outlines,"" said Mark Grant, chief fixed income strategist at Hilltop Securities, who added that he nonetheless expected the new administration's policies to help stock prices.

Mo Brooks.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERLawmakers are set to hold leadership elections this coming Tuesday. Yet, in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, Brooks indicated that he is not sure whether he will support the re-election of Speaker Ryan, who has a two-decade long history of championing open borders immigration policies.""It depends on the President-elect's preferences,' Brooks tells Breitbart.In 2015, Brooks voted to elect Ryan as Speaker of the House after Ryan personally promised him that he would not bring up any major immigration legislation while President Barack Obama was still in office.Yet Ryan swiftly broke that promise by quadrupling the controversial H-2B guest worker program in his omnibus spending bill, which immigration attorney Ian Smith explained would disproportionately ""hurt America's most  vulnerable workers"" by allowing them to be replaced by temporary foreign workers.""I don't believe that Paul Ryan's position on immigration is consistent with what is in the best interest of America,"" Brooks told Breitbart. ""But that's why we have these policy debates and disagreements. I would prefer someone who is stronger on immigration, but Paul Ryan has assured me, again, for this next session of Congress--as he did during the last year, in which he was Speaker-- that no bill on immigration will come to the House floor unless a majority of the GOP conference supports it.""Breitbart News followed up.Breitbart: ""Well, last year he did put into the omnibus... [an] expansion to the H-2B visa program-- even though he made that promise.""Brooks: ""I understand.""Breitbart: ""Do you think [he'll keep] his promise this time... better than last time?""Brooks: ""I don't know.""Following Ryan's broken promise, Congressman Brooks took to the House floor in January and declared:House Speaker Paul Ryan claims increasing foreign worker visas [quote] ""help[s] small businesses who cannot find labor when there's a surge in demand for their labor like seafood processing, or tourism."" [end quote] This claimed labor shortage is unsupported by jobs or wage data and is political bunk!""Mr. Speaker, while these surges in foreign worker visas and foreign labor work permits is a huge victory for special interests that profit from suppressed wages, it is a debilitating loss for struggling American families,"" Brooks said. ""Unemployed and underpaid Americans desperate for a good-paying job have every right to be angry at a federal government that takes American jobs from American citizens and gives them to foreigners.""Perhaps presciently, Brooks added: ""Americans have every right to be angry at Washington elected officials who care more about special interest campaign contributions than American voters who elected us. I hope these Americans will remember their anger during 2016's primary and general elections.  That is the way to force Washington to represent us!""""Mr. Speaker, I can't speak for anyone else but, as for me, Mo Brooks, from Alabama's 5th Congressional District, I fight for the economic interests of American citizens and against policies that undermine the struggling American voters who sent us here,"" Brooks concluded.According to Pew polling data, 92 percent of the GOP electorate is opposed to Ryan's expansionist immigration agenda.Reports analyzing Trump's historic upset suggest that the American people did indeed ""remember their anger"" over Ryan and political elites' expansionist immigration policies that put foreign interests ahead of the interests of American workers.Yet Brooks now indicates he is undecided on whether he will vote to re-elect as House Speaker a man who has been one of Washington's biggest advocates of open borders.""The Speaker's race... all really comes down to one thing,"" Brooks says. ""You can throw out the public policy, you can throw out all the personalities, it comes down to whether Donald Trump wants Paul Ryan as Speaker of the House.""When asked if he thinks his constituents who just propelled Trump to victory want Ryan as House Speaker, Brooks said ""my constituency wants Donald Trump's wishes respected.""As to his own preferences, Brooks explained: ""I strongly prefer strong, aggressive leadership on behalf of Republican ideas rather than wishy-washy compromising leadership. In the context of the Speaker's race, if Hillary Clinton had been elected president, we would definitely need a House Speaker with a stronger backbone [than Ryan].""Yet, as proponents of immigration controls have noted, Ryan has demonstrated that he can be quite forceful when it comes to his efforts to push for expansionist immigration policies.""There is nobody around in the party who is more fanatically dedicated to the cause of open borders than Paul Ryan,"" Conservative Review's Daniel Horowitz has explained. ""Whereas most others could be talked off the ledge on this issue, Ryan is a true believer.""""Open borders is in his ideological DNA,"" Roy Beck, the president of the immigration control group NumbersUSA, has explained. ""He's an ideologue and has spent his whole life working for ideologues. Open borders seeps out of every pore of his being... This isn't personal, it's just who he is... Ryan is the heart and soul of crony capitalism.""Indeed, Brooks himself seemed to suggest that if Ryan were elected Speaker, much of Trump's efforts to enact his mandate on curbing immigration may have to be done against the wishes of Speaker Ryan. When asked about Ryan's recent comments on CNN, in which Ryan indicated that the removing illegal aliens is not going to be a ""focus"" of a Trump administration, Brooks said:""The President of the United States can enforce our immigration laws without any help from the United States Congress. The laws are already on the books. So if Donald Trump wants to secure our border and enforce our immigration law, he has the power to do that regardless of what the Majority Leader of the Senate or the Speaker of the House may think, do, or say.""""[I] strongly disagree with him [Ryan] on whether the importation of huge amounts of foreign labor is good for struggling American families,"" Brooks added. ""I believe it costs struggling America families jobs. And those lucky enough to get jobs will suffer from wage suppression as a consequence of the floodgates having been opened-- not only for illegal aliens, but also for lawful immigrants. If we had a booming economy, it would be one thing. But we don't. We have an anemic economy. And Americans are suffering because of our open borders policy. The economic data is clear and irrefutable. All Americans-- regardless of whether they are African American, Hispanic America, Asian America, or Caucasian American-- have been hurt by the huge influx of foreign labor that takes jobs from American citizens and hurts the wages of those Americans fortunate enough to get jobs.""Reports have documented Ryan's longstanding support for the low-wage, high-immigration policies desired by the party's donor class.Despite the vocal objection of his Republican constituents, Ryan championed an omnibus spending bill last year that fully funded President Obama's immigration agenda--including funding for sanctuary cities, unconstitutional executive amnesty, the resettlement of illegal aliens within the United States, the release of criminal aliens, tax credits for illegal aliens, and a controversial expansion of Obama's refugee resettlement operation.Dating back to his time as a Capitol Hill staffer in the mid-90s, Ryan was part of the effort to derail the bipartisan immigration curbs inspired by Civil Rights leader and late-Democratic Congresswoman Barbara Jordan.In 2013, Paul Ryan worked hand-in-hand with open borders advocate Luis Gutierrez to push the Obama-Rubio amnesty agenda. Gutierrez has previously said, ""I have only one loyalty...and that's to the immigrant community.""At a joint event with Gutierrez in 2013, Ryan made the case for dissolving borders--declaring unabashedly that America ""is more than our borders.""In fact, in 2015, Gutierrez was one of Ryan's earliest supporters for his election as House Speaker.It is unclear whether members of the House Freedom Caucus and conservative lawmakers--including Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows, Jeff Duncan, Jim Bridenstine, Brian Babin, Steve King, Matt Salmon, Alex Mooney, Gary Palmer, Barry Loudermilk, John Fleming and others--who voted for Ryan last year, share Gutierrez's previously expressed support for Ryan and whether they will vote to elect him again as House Speaker on Tuesday.Breitbart: ""Well, last year he did put into the omnibus... [an] expansion to the H-2B visa program-- even though he made that promise.""
Brooks: ""I understand.""
Breitbart: ""Do you think [he'll keep] his promise this time... better than last time?""
Brooks: ""I don't know.""House Speaker Paul Ryan claims increasing foreign worker visas [quote] ""help[s] small businesses who cannot find labor when there's a surge in demand for their labor like seafood processing, or tourism.""

Elizabeth Warren and Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chairman Keith Ellison, according to an agenda and other documents obtained by POLITICO.The meeting is the first major gathering of the institutional left since Trump's shocking victory over Hillary Clinton in last week's presidential election, and, if the agenda is any indication, liberals plan full-on trench warfare against Trump from Day One. Some sessions deal with gearing up for 2017 and 2018 elections, while others focus on thwarting President-elect Trump's 100-day plan, which the agenda calls ""a terrifying assault on President Obama's achievements -- and our progressive vision for an equitable and just nation.""Yet the meeting also comes as many liberals are reassessing their approach to politics -- and the role of the Democracy Alliance, or DA, as the club is known in Democratic finance circles. The DA, its donors and beneficiary groups over the last decade have had a major hand in shaping the institutions of the left, including by orienting some of its key organizations around Clinton, and by basing their strategy around the idea that minorities and women constituted a so-called ""rising American electorate"" that could tip elections to Democrats.That didn't happen in the presidential election, where Trump won largely on the strength of his support from working-class whites. Additionally, exit polls suggested that issues like fighting climate change and the role of money in politics -- which the DA's beneficiary groups have used to try to turn out voters -- didn't resonate as much with the voters who carried Trump to victory.""The DA itself should be called into question,"" said one Democratic strategist who has been active in the group and is attending the meeting. ""You can make a very good case it's nothing more than a social club for a handful wealthy white donors and labor union officials to drink wine and read memos, as the Democratic Party burns down around them.""Read the rest of the story here.SIGN UP"

My thesis at the Isaac and Jesse Kaplan Centre at the University of Cape Town dealt with the troubled status of Jews in an increasingly anti-Israel, and antisemitic, post-apartheid South Africa. I believe myself to be a qualified judge of what is, and is not, antisemitic.It defies logic that a man who was a close friend, confidant, and adviser to the late Andrew Breitbart -- a proud Jew -- could have any negative feelings towards Jews. As I can testify from years of work together with Steve in close quarters, the opposite is the case: Steve is outraged by antisemitism. If anything, he is overly sensitive about it, and often takes offense on Jews' behalf.Steve cares deeply about the fate of Jewish communities in America and throughout the world, a fact that is reflected in Breitbart News' daily coverage. It was in that spirit that Steve joined Breitbart News CEO Larry Solov (also Jewish) in launching Breitbart Jerusalem last year, fulfilling Andrew's dream of opening a bureau in Israel specifically to cover the region from an unabashedly Zionist perspective.I've worked closely w/ Steve Bannon at Breitbart.

We gain a deeper appreciation for people from other backgrounds when we understand our own. That is the spirit in which Breitbart News has always operated with Steve as executive chairman. We have Jewish, Catholic, evangelical, Muslim, black, white, Asian, Hispanic, and gay writers (did I miss anyone?).Steve is a tireless, disciplined manager who demands excellence -- and who seeks talent regardless of distinctions of race, gender, religion, sexuality, or any other kind. He has a clear sense of strategy and vision, yet welcomes debate and dissent on the basis of data and facts. He is also passionate about fighting corruption, and restoring the constitutional vision of our Founders. And he is calm under pressure, as his work as CEO of the Trump campaign shows.Americans should see Steve's appointment to a key White House role as a positive sign that President-elect Donald Trump intends to fulfill his promises.Andrew Breitbart anticipated the kind of attacks that Steve, and anyone else who is effective at opposing the left, would face. In his book Righteous Indignation: Excuse Me While I Save the World, Andrew noted that the ""Democrat-media complex"" would tarnish any conservative with ""made-up closet KKK status.""While being targeted is a badge of honor for Steve, lies are lies, and they deserved to be called what they are.Joel B.

Buchanan told Secrets.""It shows that Donald Trump rewards loyalty, is unintimidated by Political Correctness, and recognizes that populism and America First nationalism are indispensable elements of the Republican Party of the future,"" said Buchanan.Conservative pioneer Richard Viguerie called Bannon ""indepensible"" who ""will do more than balance"" the mainstream Republicans likely to join the Trump White House. ""I hope he is just the first of many,"" Viguerie told Secrets.""It's at this point that conservatives normally begin losing faith, watching the Republican president-elect reach out to do-nothing moderates to guide his administration,"" said Media Research Center founder Brent Bozell. ""With Bannon as chief strategist, the revolution continues. And that is good,"" he said, also adding praise for Trump's pick of Republican Party chief Reince Priebus as White House chief of staff.One of the nation's preeminent biographers of Ronald Reagan, Craig Shirley, said, ""Steve Bannon is a friend and a great patriot. He is at the vanguard of history and not the smear merchant bystanders of the corrupt liberal media."" His colleague at the public affairs firm Shirley & Banister and the group Citizens for the Republic, Diana Banister, added, ""Bravo Breitbart's Steve Bannon, friend to the forgotten man, brilliant political strategist with the tenacity and genius to drain the swamp!""Read the rest here.

The U.S. has a budgeted amount of money to do refugee resettlement, but there's no requirement that the U.S. resettle a single refugee, and there's no legal obligation to do it,"" Bill Frelick, director of Human Rights Watch's refugee program, told Newsweek.It would be ""fairly easy"" for President Trump to suspend the resettlement of Syrian refugees in the United States, Frelick told Newsweek, ""because this is discretionary.""Frelick said Trump's victory left him ""shell-shocked,"" a word that described the reaction of the entire refugee resettlement industry.In FY 2016, 85,000 refugees were resettled in the United States. The Obama administration has proposed resettling 110,000 refugees in FY 2017, which began on October 1, but Congress has not approved the budget for the full fiscal year. The current interim budget deal, which in theory only authorizes the resettlement of 85,000 refugees annually, expires on December 9.Early indications from reports on the Department of State's interactive website suggest that the federal bureaucracy may already be responding to the election of Donald Trump by reducing the number of newly arriving refugees.In October, the first month of FY 2017, 9,935 total refugees arrived in the United States, an annual run rate of about 119,000. Of these, 1,297 were from Syria.During the first eight days of November, from the the first to Election Day, 2,527 refugees arrived in the United States, of which 305 were from Syria.On Wednesday, the day after the election, 679 refugees arrived, of which 92 were from Syria.On Thursday, only 449 refugees arrived, 68 from Syria, but on Friday, only 10 refugees arrived, none from Syria.No refugees arrived on Saturday and Sunday.As of 11:30 am eastern on Monday, 36 refugees have arrived, 12 of whom are from Syria.Opponents of the Obama administration's policy to increase refugee resettlement also agree that President-elect Trump will have the authority to dramatically decrease the flow of refugees after his inauguration.""Donald Trump promised to limit the flow of Muslim refugees. Current law leaves refugee admissions up to presidential discretion, and he could accomplish this on Day One. Compared to a religious test, barring refugees from countries with large Muslim populations would be easy to enforce and, assuming no reallocation, could reduce refugee flows by 40 percent,"" David Bier of the Cato Institute told the Thompson Reuters Foundation.""Regarding legal immigration, refugee resettlement from the Middle East is likely to be suspended, pending a bottom-up review of the system,"" Mark Krikorian, executive director, Center for Immigration Studies told the Thompson Reuters Foundation.On Election Day, Lavinia Limon, Executive Director of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (USCRI), one of the nine leading volunteer agencies who receive more than $1 billion a year in federal funding, weighed in on the election with a statement that clearly favored Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.""I've been working with refugees for 43 years through Republican and Democratic administrations, and I've never ever seen refugees and immigrants as under attack as they are in this campaign by Mr. Trump. I think it's very divisive and it's very frightening for refugees and immigrants,"" Limon said.""It started with the Muslim ban, and then saying that we're not going to bring any refugees from ""terrorist"" countries, and now he's talking about extreme vetting. I don't think he really understands how extreme the vetting is now - refugees are the most scrutinized people coming to the U.S. But he is echoing a lot of the anti-refugee resettlement voices online,"" she added.""On the other hand, Clinton would likely continue many of the same efforts that the Obama Administration has begun, such as increasing the number of resettled refugees and promoting access to education and the work force,"" the USCRI Election Day statement said.""We'd be looking for her to continue the work that Obama has begun around engaging more nations in providing more resources, but more importantly, providing rights, to refugees,"" Limon added.After the voters resoundingly rejected Hillary Clinton and her support for increasing refugee resettlement in the United States on Tuesday, Limon took another tack.""We encourage our new President to continue the tradition of the best of American values including equal protection and respect for every member of society. Worldwide, millions are denied basic human rights and we are strengthened as a country when all of humanity is recognized. America has always been the beacon of hope for the oppressed and this must continue,"" she said in a statement.Mark Hetfield, CEO of HIAS (formerly the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society), another of the nine leading VOLAGS, urged President-elect Trump to keep the flow of refugees coming into the country, despite his campaign promises to the contrary:As a bitter and hard-fought campaign for president comes to an end, so should the divisive rhetoric about refugees. America has always been at its greatest when we have welcomed refugees to our shores, and at its weakest when we have shut our doors out of fear. We urge President-elect Trump to demonstrate that America is not afraid of refugees, and to show leadership for human rights and refugee protection during the global refugee crisis, the largest of its kind since the World War II.Anticipated policy decisions from the Trump administration are not the only problems facing the refugee resettlement industry.A number of states (Maine, Texas, New Jersey, and Kansas) have withdrawn recently from the federal refugee resettlement program, and the Tennessee General Assembly announced that it has hired the Thomas More Law Center to file a lawsuit to end the federal government's resettlement of refugees in the Volunteer State on Tenth Amendment grounds.As a bitter and hard-fought campaign for president comes to an end, so should the divisive rhetoric about refugees. America has always been at its greatest when we have welcomed refugees to our shores, and at its weakest when we have shut our doors out of fear.

We pray that as the new administration begins its role leading our country, it will recognize the contributions of refugees and immigrants to the overall prosperity and well-being of our nation.""While working to promote humane policies that protect refugee and immigrants' inherent dignity and keep families together, Elizondo said, it is also essential to ""honor and respect the laws of this nation.""In a recent press conference, Pope Francis underscored the difference between migrants and refugees, suggesting that they represent different problems. Immigration, he noted, ought to be ""highly regulated.""""Migrants should be treated according to certain rules, because migration is a right, but one which is highly regulated,"" he said. ""On the other hand, to be a refugee means coming from a terrible situation of war, anguish, hunger and the status of a refugee requires more care, more work.""Pope Francis made allowances for European politicians who have completely closed their borders to immigrants, saying that politicians have a right to exercise prudence in such decisions.""So what do I think of those who close their borders?"" Francis asked. ""I think that in theory no one should close their heart to a refugee, but those who govern must also exercise prudence. They should be very open to receiving them, but they should also calculate how they will be able to settle them, because a refugee must not only be welcomed, but also integrated.""""And if a country is only able to integrate 20, let's say, then it should only accept that many. If another can do more, let it do more,"" he said.Follow Thomas D. Williams on Twitter  Follow @tdwilliamsromeSIGN UP"
