SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSalman al-Ansari, president of the recently founded Saudi American Public Relations Affairs Committee in Washington DC, wrote in The Hill on Tuesday that normalizing relations with Israel will ""promote security and weaken extremism in the region.""Israel, Ansari noted, is ""one of the most sophisticated and technologically advanced countries in the field of mining,"" as well as being ""a world leader in the water engineering industry"" making it ""extraordinarily qualified to help Saudi Arabia with its ambitious desalination plans.""Even though the two nations have no diplomatic ties, there have been several indicators over recent months that relations between Riyadh and Jerusalem have significantly thawed.In August, Saudi Arabia launched a media campaign to combat anti-Semitism, paving the way for public opinion to accept the kingdom's burgeoning ties with Israel.A month before, a Saudi delegation visited the Jewish state and met with top officials.Ansari, who has more than 100,000 Twitter followers, said he founded SAPRAC to enhance relations between Saudi Arabia and the United States.Ansari said that mutual threats, especially those posed by the ""totalitarian government"" in Iran, could serve as a basis for future relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia.He urged U.S. leaders to imagine a world in which Israel and Saudi Arabia would serve as ""the new twin pillars of regional stability."" Doing so would mean the U.S. would be free to foster social and economic development in the region.Ansari argued that normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel would also constitute normalization between Arabs and Muslims and the Jewish state, and that a partnership between the two countries would usher in a ""new era of unprecedented peace and prosperity.""SIGN UP"	['Israel', 'Hill']	[]

The representatives of other Arab nations also slammed Egypt and the Sissi government for the vote.In response to the Egyptian vote, the Saudi oil company Aramco announced that it would end the supply of Saudi oil to Egypt, leading the Egyptian government to seek alternatives in Kuwait, Algeria and even Venezuela.Lamis Alhadidi, a prominent Egyptian journalist affiliated with the Sissi administration, responded with a rebuke of Saudi Arabia, saying, ""Salman, you don't punish Sissi and you don't restrict his hand.""Another Egyptian journalist, Ibrahim Issa, criticized Saudi Arabia and blamed the kingdom for causing the multiple crises currently engulfing the Arab nations. Issa claimed on his television show that ""everything that's happening in Syria, in Iraq, in Yemen - wars and disasters - this is all the creation of the Wahabist policy. Saudi Arabia is part of everything that's happening.""The journalist Wael Alabrashy, also affiliated with the Egyptian government, was outraged over the claims of the Saudi ambassador to the UN that it hurt to see countries like Malaysia and Senegal supporting a French proposal calling for a ceasefire while Egypt chose instead to support the Russian proposal. Alabrashy demanded Saudi Arabia's representatives apologize for the ambassador's comments.""Egypt's position is independent,"" said Alabrashy. ""The Saudis have the right to take their own stance, but no one should be preaching to us with the claim that Malaysia and Senegal supported the Arab stance more than Egypt did, as the Saudi ambassador said.""Meanwhile, some opponents of the Egyptian government and supporters of Saudi Arabia began using a hashtag on social media: ""Egypt_voted_for_Russia's_proposal.""One user named Waleed posted a video from a discussion on Saudi television in which the pundits attacked Egypt and claimed that the country was up for purchase: ""Turkey stood next to us because we didn't try to buy her for a little rice. But those who we tried to buy with a little rice sold out in New York for a few lentils.""#mSr_tSwt_lSlH_lmshrw`_lrwsy #yqf_mdd_mSr_blnfTlly tshtryh blrz yby`k bfwl  pic.twitter.com/D8pPCDIHXY-- Waleed rH_nflskm# (@waleedpq) October 10, 2016Another user named Reem posted, ""How do we expect loyalty from Sissi who violated the oath, who betrayed Allah, his homeland and his presidency?

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERCalled ""The U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation,"" the initiative is a national coalition of the BDS movement. The campaign has been condemned by pro-Israel advocates, who view it as ""a flagrant escalation in anti-Israel efforts in the United States,"" the Jerusalem Post reported.So far, it is not known whether campaign leaders have managed to meet with congressional politicians.A briefing on Capitol Hill sponsored by the group was canceled last month after several media outlets pointed out the group's hostility towards Israel.On Friday, the group will hold a three-day conference in Arlington, Virginia called ""Which Side Are You On? Taking a Stand for Palestinian Rights.""The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs said the organization ""calls for Israel's destruction as a Jewish state. Rather than opposing particular Israeli policies, it opposes Israel's very existence and rejects a two-state solution.""The JCPA further claimed that the campaign's co-founder, Anna Baltzer, has in the past argued against Israel's existence:""I recognized that the problem was not simply occupation, but rather the creation and maintenance of an ethno-nationalist Jewish entity. ... I realized occupation was just one step in a much longer process, and I couldn't simply oppose one and not the other,"" she said in an interview with the Virtual Mosque website in 2009.The JCPA went on to state that the campaign's leaders ""support [and in some cases have ties to] designated terrorist organizations and have a track record of violence and incitement.""Baltzer has in the past expressed support for the terrorist activities of Fatah's Aksa Martyrs Brigades - a group responsible for suicide bombings during the Second Intifada and ""one of the most violent Palestinian armed groups, which has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, EU, and Canada,"" JCPA noted.In the past, questions have been raised about the veracity of Baltzer's identity. Referring to herself as a ""Jewish-American Columbia graduate, former-Fulbright scholar, the granddaughter of Holocaust refugees, lecturer, author, and activist for Palestinian rights,"" the campaign's Director of Organizing claims to have had an epiphany after going on a Birthright Israel trip during which she was ""indoctrinated"" with pro-Israel views.However, Lee Kaplan of the Gatestone Institute performed a background check in 2013 and couldn't verify any of her claims:According to my research, Anna Baltzer never went on a Birthright tour of Israel in the year 2000 or any other time. Inquiries to the New York and Israel offices to ascertain if she went with Birthright revealed absolutely no record of any Anna Baltzer attending the program ever, let alone in year 2000. In short, it seems that Anna Baltzer lied about her participation in Birthright to convey the false impression that she was once a loyal Jew who supported the Jewish homeland but had discovered the justification for Palestinians' goals to overthrow Israel.Further, after researching Ms. Baltzer's claims of being a Fulbright Scholar from Columbia in 2003, it has been determined from both Columbia's and the Fulbright websites, as well as Fulbright officials, that Anna Baltzer was never a Fulbright scholar either.It later emerged that Baltzer may have used her original name, Piller, on her Birthright trip (Baltzer being a made-up Jewish-sounding last name). But neither Piller nor Baltzer were listed as Fulbright scholars at any time from 1990 onwards. Further, her grandparents were never in Nazi concentration camps in Poland.According to my research, Anna Baltzer never went on a Birthright tour of Israel in the year 2000 or any other time. Inquiries to the New York and Israel offices to ascertain if she went with Birthright revealed absolutely no record of any Anna Baltzer attending the program ever, let alone in year 2000.

""All three nights of the latest survey follow Sunday's debate.""Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson received six percent in the latest survey, while Green Party Candidate Jill Stein received two percent. Four percent of likely voters remain undecided.The Rasmussen results found:Eighty-four percent (84%) now say they are certain how they will vote in this year's presidential election, and among these voters, Trump posts a 49% to 46% lead over Clinton.

That was predictable. What was less predictable was the incredibly weak, and misleading, case the Post editorial board attempted to make as it argued that she is not the lesser of two evils, but will make an ""excellent"" president.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe Post cannot highlight Clinton's achievements. Instead, it re-casts her many failures as ""a series of learning experiences that have prepared her well"" for the Oval Office.For example, it excuses Clinton's role in the ill-fated Russian ""reset"" by pretending that no one could have predicted the result: ""When Ms. Clinton launched the policy, Dmitry Medvedev, not Vladimir Putin, was president of Russia, and nobody -- maybe not even Mr. Putin -- knew how things would play out."" Everyone knew that Putin controlled the real power behind Medvedev, and the Russians immediately took advantage of Clinton's weakness, pushing back U.S. missile defenses.The Post cites Clinton's ""executive experience"" as Secretary of State, but cites no actual accomplishments. The word ""Iran"" does not appear once in the editorial.Most laughable of all, the Post describes the Benghazi terror attack as a ""hyper-investigated"" controversy that ""proved to be no scandal at all."" Never mind Clinton's dereliction of duty on the night of Sep. 11; never mind her refusal to provide increased security beforehand; never mind her lies about a YouTube video; never mind the intimidation of witnesses when investigations began; never mind the emails she destroyed, while under subpoena.About those emails: the Post brushes aside the controversy. ""Her use of a private email server as secretary was a mistake, not a high crime; but her slow, grudging explanations of it worsened the damage and insulted the voters."" The Post glosses over her continued lies, and omits her mis-handling of classified information.The Post's nod is not an endorsement, but just the latest a cover-up.Joel B.

Yenni - who has not been charged with a crime - sent sexually explicit text message to the teen after noticing him at a high school event, reports WWL-TV, which continues:The youth who received the messages said Yenni, who was then the mayor of Kenner, first saw him at a function at his high school, a local Catholic institution. He said a mutual friend, who was 19 at the time, helped Yenni connect with him....The friend, who allegedly helped connect the two, declined to be interviewed by WWL-TV. The youth said he and Yenni began to talk on the phone and text one another, and soon, the politician came to visit him at his job at a mall food court. They met in a bathroom, the youth said, and Yenni gave him some designer underwear. They kissed briefly.The texting continued, becoming more explicit over time. The youth provided WWL-TV what he says are copies of the text exchanges that were recovered after they were deleted, on the condition that the station not directly quote from them. Printouts of the messages appear to indicate they came from a cell phone account linked to Yenni in multiple online search engines. WWL-TV called the number in June and got the same outgoing voicemail message, featuring Yenni's voice, as could be heard on Yenni's official parish cell phone at the time.The phone listed on the printouts of the text messages is not billed to taxpayers.According to printouts of those texts, Yenni tells the teen he wants him naked.Days later, Yenni writes to ask the 17-year-old if he's worn the underwear Yenni bought him. Yenni says he wants to see him model it.Then Yenni texts the teen to say he wants to perform a sex act on him that night.The youth, who is openly gay and is now in college, said in an interview with WWL-TV that he wants to expose Yenni's behavior because he finds it disturbing.While the youth was initially flattered and intrigued by Yenni's overtures, he said the texts and phone conversations began to make him uncomfortable, such as one proposing three-way sex with him and the 19-year-old mutual friend.""He asked me to go with him to his house in Oxford (Mississippi),"" the youth said. Records show Yenni owns an apartment there. ""Also, the way he would describe the sexual things he wanted to do to me. And he asked me to be a secretary or assistant in his office; that way I could be with him and not be questioned.""Weeks after the sexting began, in June 2015, the youth said he broke off communication and blocked Yenni's number.In a statement from his office Monday, Yenni, a Republican, announced that he will not resign his position because ""the incident at the center of this allegation is personal"" and, in no way, does it ""impact my ability to govern.""""I have read with humility your request for my resignation,"" Yenni said. ""While I understand your position and your concerns, I have and will continue to dutifully perform the obligations of the Office of Parish President.""Yenni continued:As I noted in my statement, my actions are regrettable, and I am penitent. I have accepted responsibility for my poor judgment, and I apologized publicly to all parties involved. I did not violate any laws, I have not been contacted by any investigatory agency, especially the FBI, regarding this allegation.I want to put this in the proper perspective. I have been true to the oath that I have taken. I stated clearly that I never abused or misused my powers as a public official and there has been no misuse of tax dollars or public assets. And, I will work harder than ever to prove that good can rise from a bad decision.Yenni is facing a chorus of calls for his resignation and warnings to stay clear of school campuses.Jefferson Parish Council members called upon Yenni to resign, and the school board discussed banning him from their schools. Both the Gretna and Westwego City Councils voted for his resignation. Assessor Tom Capella, clerk of court Jon Gegenheimer, coroner Gerry Cvitanovich and sheriff Newell Normand also called for Yenni's resignation.U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, the House Majority Whip, cancelled his fundraiser scheduled with Yenni, citing the ""deeply concerning"" allegations.Nationally, the New York Post cited Yenni's ""bizarre infomercial"" in which he admitted to the sexting scandal.Metairie attorney Robert Evans III filed a petition Wednesday to begin a recall.Attorney G. Patrick Hand III tells Breitbart News he is also filing for a recall drive. In his petition, Hand says:I don't care about Mr. Yenni's sexual preference (male or female). It makes absolutely no difference to me.However, the fact that Mr. Yenni did this with a minor, regardless of the age of consent in LA (17 y.o.a.), is very disturbing to me and many others.The fact that Mr. Yenni met his victim at an alumni function held by Mr. Yenni's Alma Mater, which is the same school the victim attended at the time (Jesuit High School), is very disturbing to me and many others.Many people believe Mr. Yenni used his power and influence to gain access to the 17 year old boy in question, and that he has used his power and influence to attempt to gain access to other minors.I am being told by members of Mr. Yenni's own family that there is much more to this story than simply sending inappropriate texts to a young man, as Mr. Yenni put it in his recent ""apology video.""Terri Timmcke, a Jefferson Parish resident who asked for Yenni's resignation at the JP Council meeting and is also a member of the STOP Common Core Coalition in Louisiana, tells Breitbart News, ""The members of the activist group are all concerned about the welfare of our school children, and so many are sharing information on social media sites and contacting public officials in the hopes that widespread outrage will compel President Yenni to resign.""""My biggest fear is that we, as a society, are now going to accept immoral behavior from public officials as long as it is not technically 'illegal,'"" she added.Breitbart News contacted Yenni for comment through his email address but received no response.Jefferson Parish Pres Mike Yenni in closed-door meeting with administration. @wdsu details @ 6 pic.twitter.com/Abbbts2QhF

Times Poll (Updated)	"Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton overtook Republican Donald Trump in the Oct. 12 USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll, falling behind by 0.4% -- but Trump reclaimed a narrow 0.1% lead on Oct. 13, leading 44.3% to 44.2%.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe differences are well within the margin of error, but Oct. 12 marked the first time Clinton led Trump in that poll since Sep. 12, a day after she collapsed at the 9/11 Memorial in New York.The Times poll has shown Trump with a large lead at times, and has persistently been more positive for the Republican nominee than other polls.The poll remained positive throughout an otherwise rough period for Trump, including the first presidential debate, which he was widely perceived to have lost; the controversy over his feud with former Miss Universe Alicia Machado; and the release of a hot mic conversation from 2005 on the set of Access Hollywood in which he joked about groping women. But a slew of new accusations from other women -- whether spontaneous or timed as an ""October surprise"" -- had pushed him back down.The Times poll is conducted among 400 voters daily, a subset of roughly 3,000 respondents. It is thought to be more positive for Trump than other polls because it reportedly captures ""hidden"" Trump voters -- those who might not otherwise admit to pollsters that they are voting for a nominee who has made controversial statements and is openly maligned by the media. For Trump to be losing support in the Times poll is a significant sign of trouble for the campaign as it heads into the race's final weeks.There is a significant gender gap in the poll: a majority of men polled support Trump, but majorities of both sexes believe that Clinton will win.Joel B.

Your sons are there, and your men, your brothers, your husbands. They are defending their existence, dignity and the resistance,"" he said.In a speech on Tuesday, Nasrallah asserted the Middle East was in a phase of escalating tension and there appeared to be no prospect of a political solution to the war in Syria.""The regional scene is currently one of tension and escalation, and it does not appear that there are paths for negotiations or solutions,"" he said in a rare live televised speech before thousands of supporters in Beirut, adding that ""the theater (in Syria) was open to more tension, escalation and confrontation.""On Wednesday, black-clad supporters paraded through the streets to mark the 7th-century death of the Prophet Mohammed's grandson Hussein, seen by Shi'ites as a divinely guided leader, and they roared approval of Nasrallah's remarks.""We answer your call, o Nasrallah!"" they chanted.Since Hezbollah's entry into Syria's civil war on the side of President Bashar Assad, some 1,500 of its fighters have died, say security sources in Lebanon. These have included about 350 this year; their images, often in heroic pose, are displayed on posters in Shi'ite villages across Lebanon.Hezbollah's part in the war is presented by the movement as both a defense against Sunni Muslim jihadists in Syria who have vowed to exterminate all Shi'ites, and as a way of protecting the regional Iran-backed bloc that has long sustained Hezbollah.

This awards him the best chance of any Republican in this best-of-nine, so a win by him would give Republicans one of the five wins they need on this table to retain the U.S. Senate.While Silver's projections and RealClearPolitics' averages are both well-balanced, they do account for some polls that are several days old, and thus often lag behind big events like the release of the video of Donald Trump using vulgar language, or the ensuing debate when he at the very least well surpassed expectations.Therefore, a look at the very latest poll (the right-hand column) can show a potential emerging trend, or be an outlier. Contrary to the accepted narrative of GOP chances of control collapsing in recent days, on average these nine candidates run a couple of points ahead based only on the most recent day of polling in all nine races.With Democrats telling The Hill they will now pick-up at least seven seats and widespread stories about Republican divisions hurting the GOP, one would expect the latest polls to show the GOP Senate candidates tanking. However, as of this snapshot that is not the case.If the Republicans win the three states in which they have at least a couple of point advantage (Florida, Missouri and Nevada), they would only need an additional two wins to keep the Senate.While North Carolina, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania are all extremely close, it is notable that the most recent poll in each of those three states the Republican owns a lead of between four and six points -- so win two of those three in addition to the first three in the table, and Republicans win control.Even the Indiana and Wisconsin races, where the Democrats have an edge of at least a few points, the most recent polls had each Republican within two points.The presidential race to determine whether Tim Kaine or Mike Pence can break ties in the Senate is the most favorable of the nine for the Democrats based on polling at this time, but even if they win the White House they will need four more wins on this table to take the Senate.Put it all together as of Wednesday night, and RealClearPolitics projects a 52-49 Republican edge based on their averages as well as if you just go by their most recent day of polling in each of the nine races, while Nate Silver gives the Republicans a 44 percent chance to control the U.S. Senate.In short, the Senate is almost a 50-50 chance right now ...Cubs at 33 percent Chance... which is a better chance than Cubs Nation has of celebrating for the first time in 108 years the week before the election.The Cubs are viewed as the best team in baseball, and are the ""favorite"" for the World Series. However, just like this year's election, favorite does not mean better than 50 percent.VegasInsider.com indicates the following chances of each of the remaining five teams winning the World Series:33% Chicago Cubs - chance of winning World series (8-5 builds in bookie cut)
29% Toronto Blue Jays 19/10
21% Cleveland Indians 3/1
10% Washington Nationals 15/2
7% Los Angeles Dodgers 12/1The Dodgers and Nationals play tomorrow to determine who faces the Cubs in the best-of-seven National League Championship Series for the right to face the Indians-Blue Jays winner in the World Series.With the Ohio State Buckeyes now pulling to even odds with Alabama, Clevelanders could run the table with the Cavaliers' NBA title, a winning bid for the Republican National Convention, a World Series title, and another College National Football championship.""Mistake on the Lake"" no more!SIGN UP"	['Trump', 'Pence', 'Rubio', 'Hill', 'Kaine']	[]

The meeting was expected to include foreign ministers from Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Iran.The U.S. State Department said Kerry had called for the meeting and would attend, but declined to say what foreign ministers other than Lavrov had been invited or would attend.White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Washington remained committed to a ""deep multilateral engagement"" to reduce the violence in Syria which would ""necessarily"" involve Russia too.""But it is no longer in the context of trying to broker this agreement that would ... hold out the prospect of U.S. military cooperation with Russia. That's something that Russia has lost... the credibility to be able to try to agree to,"" he said.On Wednesday, 25 people were killed by heavy air strikes on rebel-held areas of Aleppo, the Civil Defence, a rescue service working in rebel-held areas, said on Twitter, adding that 15 of them were killed at a market place in the Fardous district.The Syrian army has denied targeting civilians.AIR STRIKESA Syrian military source said warplanes had struck several locations to the south and southwest of Aleppo but Syrian and Russian officials could not immediately be reached to comment on the market place attack.It was the second day of heavy air strikes after a lull of several days which the Syrian army said was designed to allow civilians to leave.Rebels said the intensity of the air strikes on Tuesday and Wednesday had returned to the level seen at the start of the Russian-backed campaign to capture Aleppo.Moscow's intervention, which began just over a year ago, has tipped the scales back towards President Bashar al-Assad.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based organisation that reports on the war, said it had documented the deaths of 55 people killed in escalating bombardment of eastern Aleppo in the last 48 hours.The Observatory also reported that four people were killed in government-held areas by insurgent shelling.Clashes between pro-government and rebel forces were also reported in a rebel-held area in southern Aleppo.The war has killed more than 300,000 people, created the world's worst refugee crisis, allowed for the rise of Islamic State and drawn in regional and major powers.Assad aims to take back all of Aleppo, which was Syria's biggest city before the outbreak of war in 2011.The city has been divided between government and rebel control for years and food, water and medical supplies in rebel areas are now running low.Last Saturday Russia vetoed a French-drafted United Nations Security Council resolution that would have demanded an immediate end to air strikes and military flights over Aleppo.On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused France of deliberately luring Moscow into vetoing the resolution and suggested it was doing the bidding of the United States.""What for? To exacerbate the situation and to whip up anti-Russian hysteria in media under their control, and to deceive their own citizens,"" Putin said, accusing France of serving U.S. domestic political interests.""OBSTRUCTIVE ATTITUDE""Putin later told France's TF1 television channel that the West, especially the United States, was responsible for Syria's plight and he dismissed the Western accusations of Russian and Syrian war crimes as ""political rhetoric"".French Prime Minister Manuel Valls faced criticism from opposition lawmakers over his government's handling of relations with Russia over Syria.""Russia has chosen an obstructive attitude and from our point of view this stance is unjustifiable,"" Valls said after being asked by a parliamentarian why Paris was adopting a tough position on Russia.Despite the war of words, the Kremlin said Putin spoke to French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday and said he hoped Saturday's talks would be ""fruitful"".France and Britain back a proposal for a dilution of big powers' United Nations vetoes in cases of serious war crimes, the top U.N. human rights official said in Geneva, but he gave little support to Syrian opposition hopes of strong-arming Russia over eastern Aleppo.Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said last week that Security Council veto powers should be curbed to help resolve the situation and bring Syria under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.The dispute over Aleppo has unfolded against a backdrop of separate campaigns being waged against Islamic State by a U.S.-led alliance and the Russian-backed Syrian army.As part of the fight against IS, Syrian rebels backed by Turkey are currently waging a campaign in northern Syria near the Turkish border.A rebel commander told Reuters the Turkey-backed forces had advanced closer to an Islamic State-held village that is of great symbolic significance to the group on Wednesday.The rebels captured the village of Duweibiq, which is some 2 km from Dabiq - the site of an apocalyptic prophecy central to the militant group's ideology. ""The clashes were not very fierce but there is resistance,"" the commander said.SIGN UP"	[]	[]

Its current members include such noted human rights exemplars as China, Cuba, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela.Since its establishment in 2003, the UN Human Rights Council has taken 80 actions against Israel -- more than three times as many as it has taken against Syria, a regime that has deliberately murdered hundreds of thousands of civilians and displaced millions more. It has only taken six actions against Iran and one against Cuba. Actions against Israel make up nearly 30% of the UN Human Rights Council's activity.Zeid's own country, Jordan, severely restricts basic liberties. According to the most recent State Department report on human rights, Jordan practices ""restrictions on the freedom of expression, including detention of journalists, which limited the ability of citizens and media to criticize government policies and officials; citizens' inability to change their government peacefully; and mistreatment and allegations of torture by security and government officials.""Reid's remarks have stirred controversy within the UN -- not because of the substance of his criticism, but because he is perceived to have a habit on commenting on the internal political affairs of other countries. The Associated Press notes:In recent months, Zeid has made speeches that denounced ""demagogues"" and specifically targeted Trump and several populist leaders in Europe, even likening their tactics to Islamic State propaganda. In Cleveland, Ohio, in April, Zeid alluded to Trump comments at a November rally where he promised to restore waterboarding and introduce even harsher interrogation methods for suspected terrorists.The AP adds: ""The comments from Zeid, a Jordanian prince, are likely to fan a debate in U.N. circles about whether he has been overstepping his mandate.""Joel B.

John Kasich ""appears almost delusional in his absolute conviction that he is going to be the next president.""SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERJack Boyle, the co-founder of PutGrowthFirst.com and a resident of suburban Cleveland, adds that the Ohio governor has put out the word throughout the party nobody should do anything to support GOP nominee Donald Trump.Because of the governor's hostility to Trump, the state party's apparatus is only working on so-called down-ticket races, that is it is working to help everyone, except Trump, Boyle says.The county party chairman are caught between the wishes of the governor and the Republican voters, who support Trump-and they are unwilling to jump off the cliff with him, Boyle said.In the absence of Republican Party support, the National Rifle Association has stepped up to provide field operations, he said.The Ohio GOP is notoriously bad at its ground game, so with the NRA, the presidential nominee may have a better ground game than the one the party gave Mitt Romney in 2012 or Sen. John McCain in 2008, he said.In the 2012 election, President Barack Obama beat Romney with 51 percent of the vote to Romney's 48 percent.Ohio has 18 votes in the Electoral College.Boyle said when the lewd tape from 2005 that showed Trump speaking with direct language about his failed courtship with a married woman and his experience with women, who want to spent time with celebrities, hit the whole state was rocked by it.In the wake of the tape scandal, some Ohio Republican Members of Congress, Sen. Rob Portman, Rep. David Joyce and Rep. Patrick Tiberi repudiated their support of Trump, he said.""There is now a very vocal grassroots outrage,"" he saidMany people are now saying they will leave those lines blank, rather than vote for Portman, Joyce and Tiberi.""Portman had opened up a double-digit lead,"" he said. ""I don't know of any polling of the Senate race since then, but the outrage has been very, very vocal.""In the end, Boyle said he expects Trump to win Ohio.""But, frankly, I expected Romney to win Ohio,"" he said. ""I saw Romney and Ryan at 1:30 p.m., on Election Day in 2012 in our victory center in Cleveland, and they thought they were going to win Ohio."" Rep. Paul Ryan (R.-Wis.) ran as the vice-presidential nominee with Romney.The operative said that in March 2013, a study of the 2012 campaign in Ohio showed that if Republican turnout had matched Republican turnout in the previous three presidential elections in just 10 counties, Romney would have won.""It wasn't voter fraud, which there was a lot, it wasn't the Obama turnout machine, which was substantial, it was that Republicans did not vote that caused Romney to lose,"" he said.""I never thought anyone could poll worse than John McCain, until Romney came along,"" he said.""My predictive ability is very limited,"" he said.

That is followed by a ""terror attack, not having enough money for the future, and terrorism."" Fifth on the list of things that scare Americans most are ""government restrictions on firearms and ammunition."" And you have to go a long way down the list-yes, past Obamacare, reptiles, tornadoes, and the threat of extinction-before you get to fear of a mass shooting or other crimes committed with a gun.Here are some of the other things people fear more than mass shootings:After pollution, Americans fear ""break-ins""-and although break-ins do not require a gun, they represent the first thing on the list that could involve one. Following break-ins, Americans fear""widespread civil unrest"" and ""nuclear accident/meltdown."" And then, finally, a ""random/mass shooting.""Think about it-""Corrupt government officials"" are Americans' number one fear, gun control is number five,  and way down on the list-at number 30-is fear of a mass shooting.

She said she attended a private Clinton fundraiser at the home of a local dentist, where she had an encounter with the Clintons and was directly approached by Hillary.In the video interview with this reporter, filmed in the presidential suite of the historic Watergate Hotel in Washington, D.C,  Broaddrick explained that she was in possession of checks from donors to be delivered to Clinton's campaign as well as a list of potential donors.  Broaddrick was a volunteer for Clinton's gubernatorial campaign.She says she went to the fundraiser about thirty minutes early in an attempt to avoid the Clintons.Instead, she says, Bill and Hillary Clinton arrived early, as well.She recounted during the interview:""And they come in early from the kitchen area. And just before they do, a gentleman who had driven them from the airport comes straight over to me. He was supporting Clinton but he didn't know what had happened to me even though he was a friend. And he said the topic of the conversation all the way from the airport was about you.""And that startled me. And I knew I had to get out of there. Well, just as he moved here comes Hillary straight for me. And she gets to me and she starts saying, 'I just want to thank you for everything you are doing for Bill's campaign. And it's so nice to meet you.' And all of these things.""So I just nodded and I told my friend, 'Let's go.' And I thought somebody from behind had grabbed a hold of my arm. But it was her. She grabbed a hold of my arm and my hand and she pulls me into her. And she says with this very angry look on her face, which had been so pleasant seconds before. And in a low voice, says, 'Do you understand? Everything that you do.' And that frightened me.""I asked whether she believes that Hillary Clinton knew at the time that her husband had allegedly raped Broaddrick.Broaddrick replied: """"People have asked me that and said 'Well, do you think she knew what happened?' At that moment. And I have to go by what I felt then and the look that she gave me. I felt like she knew.""""That he raped you?"" I asked.""Yes,"" Broaddrick stated. ""And that she was telling me to keep quiet.""""To keep quiet about her husband's rape?"" I questioned.""Yeah,"" she stated.On Sunday, Breitbart News released an exclusive video interview in which Broaddrick recounted what she described as the life-changing experience of being raped by Clinton. The YouTube video has since garnered over one million views.Watch that video here:Trembling, Broaddrick explained that she is still afraid of Bill Clinton and asserted that she is frightened by the prospect of Hillary winning the election. She described the alleged rape in vivid detail, providing the most extensive window yet into the singular event that she says left her traumatized until today.In one dramatic scene, a sobbing Broaddrick was embraced and consoled by another alleged Clinton sexual assault victim, Kathleen Willey, who was present for the filming.Willey tells the crying Broaddrick: ""It's not your fault.

""By finding out how the heart first starts to beat and how problems can arise in heart development, we are one step closer to being able to prevent heart conditions from arising during pregnancy.""Riley added the new research could help in understanding how to repair damaged heart muscle following a heart attack.The researchers demonstrated the earlier heart beating in the hearts of mouse embryos and extrapolated the results to human hearts. In mice, the cardiac crescent -- which occurs early in heart development -- forms 7.5 days after conception, the equivalent to 16 days for the human embryo. Researchers previously believed the heart began to beat a stage later.The study may ultimately help scientists understand more about the formation of the heart in utero and how to prevent heart conditions that may arise as the unborn baby develops.""This study describes some of the very first stages in the development of a beating heart, identifies some of the key molecules involved and shows that the initiation of the beat itself has a bearing on the further development of the heart,"" said Sir Nilesh Samani, medical director at the BHF.

The poll taken of 600 likely Missouri voters shows Trump with 47 to Hillary Clinton's 34 percent. The margin of error was 3.9 percent.Trump's lowest lead in Missouri was seen in a recent Monmouth poll of 406 likely voters taken between October 9 and 11 which found Trump leading Hillary 46 to 41 points. The MOE was 4.9 in the Monmouth poll.These results seem essentially unchanged in the RCP Average from as far back as September 29.Meanwhile, GOP Senate candidate Roy Blunt seems to be holding a slight lead over challenger Democrat Jason Kander with an RCP average of plus 2.3 points.But not all GOP candidates are leading. In the race for Governor it appears that Democrat Chris Koster is enjoying a lead over Republican Eric Greitens. RCP gives the race a plus 8.4 for the Democrat.However, a new Momnmouth poll finds that the Republican has cut Democrat Koster's lead to a statistical tie, proving that the race is still a volatile one. With only weeks to go before Election Day, Monmouth finds Democrat Koster at 46 percent while his Republican opponent, Eric Greitens, is at 43. With a margin of error of 4.9 percent, that makes the race a statistical tie as far as Monmouth is concerned.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.SIGN UP	['Blunt', 'Trump', 'Warner']	[]

It really has to do with the things that, the things that reach your kitchen table.""He referred to the ""avalanche of scandals and controversies and conflicts of interests flowing just out of the recent Clinton years in public service.""Pence went after Clinton for her ""private family foundation,"" the Clinton Foundation, that took tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments and donors while she served as secretary of state, the third-ranking constitutional officer. He remarked that half of the meetings she took while in the position were given to major donors to her family's Clinton Foundation. And he spoke of the high technology used to destroy her emails and use of hammers to destroy electronic devices used to send them.""I'm old enough to remember a president who erased 18 and a half minutes and they ran him out of town,"" said Pence -- the reference to the Watergate scandal and former President Nixon being forced into leaving the office of President of the United States. ""And Hillary Clinton deleted more than 18,000 emails that were under a subpoena from the United States congress.""""Men and women, that doesn't look like politics to me, that looks like obstruction,"" said Pence.""Even with the Clintons, sometimes truth happens,"" Pence said of former president Bill Clinton's statement on the ""craziest thing in the world"" that is Obamacare.

""We'll repeal Obamacare day one and we will start over ... we're gonna replace it with the kind of health care reform that empowers patients, allows you to choose your doctor, and captures the power and energy of the free market,"" Pence said.He told the crowd that he was encouraged by their enthusiasm and urged them to get out and work their hearts out in the next 28 days to elect Donald Trump as the next President of the United States.

Based on this, the paper calls for voters in ""California, Maine, Nevada, and Washington"" to support gun control measures that will be on the ballot next month.The NYT does not mention that California is already one of the most gun-controlled states in the union. It has comprehensive background checks -- which eliminate a ""gun show loophole"" or ""online loophole"" -- a waiting period on gun purchases, firearm registration, and gun confiscation laws, yet it also had the May 23, 2014, Santa Barbara attack, the December 2, 2015, San Bernardino firearm-based terror attack, the June 1, 2016, murder-suicide on the gun-free UCLA campus, and the October 8, 2016, high-profile shooting deaths of two police officers in Palm Springs.Washington state also has comprehensive background checks -- the very checks Hillary Clinton, Gabby Giffords, and Michael Bloomberg-funded gun control groups pursue as key to American safety. Yet our nation's most recent mass shooting took place in Burlington, Washington, on September 23. Five innocent lives were taken in Cascades Mall. On July 30, three innocents were shot and killed at a house party just north of Seattle, and in late February, the AP reported a gunman killed four people then himself in Belfair, Washington.Ironically, much of the momentum for gun control continues to come from the December 14, 2012, attack on Sandy Hook Elementary. Even now, new laws are being pushed under the guise of preventing such an attack, and the NYT says a total of eight states have passed ""universal background checks"" -- the same thing as comprehensive background checks -- as a way to keep a Sandy Hook-like attack from occurring. But if the examples of California and Washington state teach us anything, it is that comprehensive background checks offer no hindrance to determined attackers.In fact, it is worth remembering that Connecticut was ranked 5th in the nation for most stringent gun controls when the attack on Sandy Hook occurred. The Brady Campaign Against Gun Violence lauded Connecticut for 5th ""toughest"" laws in 2011, and in 2012, Adam Lanza circumvented every one of those laws by stealing his guns and carrying out a heinous crime in a gun-free zone.Nevertheless, the NYT contends that more gun control makes us safer.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

She issued a number of tweets on the topic, not one of which criticized Hillary Clinton for the way she has treated the women who allege Bill Clinton sexually assaulted them -- women like Paula Jones and Juanita Broaddrick, the latter of whom recently recounted the way Bill Clinton allegedly raped her.The Daily Mail reported that ""Jones reached an out of court settlement"" in a suit wherein she alleged that Bill, while Governor of Arkansas, dropped his pants and asked her ""to kiss it.""Trump stood up for these women, holding a press conference with them on Sunday as a way of breaking through the mainstream media's refusal to report on Bill's sexual history and Hillary's efforts to undermine that history. Heretofore, Hillary's canned response to Bill's accusers has been to go after the women. In fact, she has gone after the women with such fervor that the Washington Post recently asked if Hillary was Bill's ""enabler""?The Post reported:... Hillary Clinton dismissed an accusation made by Gennifer Flowers, the singer who sold her story to a supermarket tabloid after having previously denied an affair. In an ABC News interview, she called Flowers ""some failed cabaret singer who doesn't even have much of a resume to fall back on."" She told Esquire magazine in 1992 that if she had the chance to cross-examine Flowers, ""I mean, I would crucify her.""Trump brought a small number of women from Bill's past to the October 9 presidential debate, where he pointed out that they should be honored for standing up, rather than humiliated. Politico published the transcript of Trump looking at Bill's accusers, then saying:Hillary Clinton attacked those same women, and attacked them viciously, four of them here tonight ... So don't tell me about words.
