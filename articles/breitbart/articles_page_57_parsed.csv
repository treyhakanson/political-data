He stressed that carrying a gun is part of life whether you are Christian or not, and made clear that the option to carry belongs to pastors, as well. Smith said, ""I don't see anything wrong with a pastor or others carrying.""Smith has already had about 100 students in the class, where he teaches the NRA's basic pistol course. His goals in teaching the class are to prepare people for proper gun use and to prevent people from having avoidable accidents with their handguns.Smith reacted to the accidental shootings that worry some and traumatize others by saying, ""The more I've learned, the more reverent and fearful I've become to make sure something doesn't happen.""AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

In the coming 12 months, four of Europe's five largest economies have votes that will almost certainly mean serious gains for right-wing populists and nationalists. Once seen as fringe groups, France's National Front, Italy's Five Star Movement, and the Freedom Party in the Netherlands have attracted legions of followers by tapping discontent over immigration, terrorism, and feeble economic performance. ""The Netherlands should again become a country of and for the Dutch people,"" says Evert Davelaar, a Freedom Party backer who says immigrants don't share ""Western and Christian values.""Even Europe's most powerful politician, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, is under assault. The anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has drained support from Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrats in recent state and local elections, capitalizing on discontent over Germany's refugee crisis. In Austria the far-right Freedom Party has a shot at winning the presidency in balloting set for Dec. 4, after an election in May that the Freedom Party narrowly lost was annulled because of irregularities in vote counting. The populists are deeply skeptical of European integration, and those in France and the Netherlands want to follow Britain's lead and quit the European Union.

Then they pull it off the market,"" he admitted, likely referring to the disastrous exploding Samsung Galaxy S7. But the president argued that companies weren't trying to repeal smart phones, but rather fix the problems with the modern devices rather than return to rotary dial up phones.""We're not going to go back,"" Obama said, challenging Republicans who repeatedly called for an Obamacare repeal.The president argued that most people got their health care from their jobs, insisting that Obamacare didn't even affect their premiums or health policy changes.""These are decisions made by your employers, it's not because of Obamacare,"" he said.He blamed Republicans for failing to sign up more young people into the insurance pools, and continuing to block the expansion of Medicare.""Part of this is because health care is complicated,"" he admitted.Obama also admitted that smaller markets in different states were suffering from the lack of competition among private insurers.To fix it, he suggested that the government should step in and offer cheaper plans in areas that weren't getting enough options.Obama explained that thanks to Obamacare, Americans now got free preventive care, free checkups for women, free mammograms, and allowed children to stay on their parents health care plans into their 20s.""You're getting better quality, even though you don't know that Obamacare is doing it,"" he said.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFrom the Washington Post:The first post-election target for the grievance movement is likely to be House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), who has drawn Trump's wrath for not supporting him more fully. Trump's backers, both inside the House Republican caucus and out, are already talking about a takedown.Fox News host and Trump ally Sean Hannity said in an interview after the debate that Ryan was a ""saboteur"" and ""needed to be called out and replaced."" Hannity said he would actively urge hard-line conservatives to launch bids against Ryan....""The revolt that has been going on in the Republican Party, that brought Trump to where he is, is not going away. If anything, it's going to intensify,"" said Patrick J. Caddell, a veteran Democratic strategist who advises Breitbart, the Trump-aligned website, on polling.""Republicans are living in a dream world if they think their voters are going to stop fighting the political class,"" Caddell said. ""What has happened will metamorphosize. The American people will not go gently into the good night of obscurity.""At the fore of this conglomeration is Stephen K. Bannon, the former head of Breitbart who has become Trump's most influential confidant. Bannon encouraged the candidate's claims of voter fraud and references to a deeply corrupt global conspiracy of international banks and corporate-friendly politicians.""What the media misses is the amount of anger that's out there.

In it, O'Leary forwarded an email containing a Washington Post article revolving around the Obama administration's rejection of Clinton's executive gun control plan.The WaPo reported, ""The Obama administration has already taken a long, internal look at the same executive-action proposal Clinton has promised to undertake, and has doubts over whether it can be made to work in practical terms, according to current and former senior administration officials.""The heart of the matter was Clinton's plan to use executive orders to further expand background checks, thereby closing the ""private seller loophole."" Doing this would require deciding how many guns a private individual needed to sell each year before being considered ""engaged in the business"" of selling guns. The Obama administration investigated this approach to gun control, only to discover that instituting a threshold for such sales proved futile and created more problems than it solved.O'Leary responded to this as ""really annoying"" and warned the other Clinton staffers to be ready for things to worsen on certain fronts.She wrote:Being really annoying.We should all check in with our folks there about it - health care (Robert Pear article); guns; and it is going to get worse...It is interesting to note that President Obama did find some executive gun controls for his administration to issue on January 5, but they have proven to be of little impact. The ones that did have impact, like the order requiring background checks for people named in trusts for weapons regulated under the National Firearms Act, only increased the burden on law-abiding citizens.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

A statistically insignificant number said they did not plan to vote at all.Clinton leads by 47 to 43 percent in the presidential race, according to YouGov - a margin-of-error lead that would become a razor-thin Trump lead, if he really did pull 60 percent of the third-party and undecided voters.(Of course, not all of Libertarian Gary Johnson's 3 percent or Green Party Jill Stein's 1 percent are likely to abandon those candidates, and the undecideds won't all decide to vote for Trump or Clinton in the sixty-forty split envisioned by the poll, so the boldest conclusion that could logically be drawn from YouGov is that it's a very tight race - a good deal tighter than most other polls suggest.)The hearty preference for Trump among these theoretically up-for-grabs voters is interesting, because the internals gave Clinton higher marks on most aspects of debate performance, save ""passion and conviction"":68% of debate watchers said Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump should ""pledge to accept the result of the election"", including 51% of Republican viewers. 14% oppose a pledge and 18% don't know.69% said Hillary Clinton showed ""excellent"" or ""good"" knowledge of policies, compared to 40% for Trump.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIn truth, top Democrat leaders regularly complain about rigged systems and stolen elections to keep their followers angry. This has never been more obvious than with the 2000 election, which Democrats routinely portray as rigged, stolen, or illegitimate to this day - and that includes Hillary Rodham Clinton.This isn't about dredging up ancient history to score rhetorical points. As critics of the Democrats' antics have pointed out over the years, they did real damage to the integrity of the U.S. political system, exactly the way Trump critics claim his statements have done - but we're talking about over 15 years of damage here, and it wasn't just one person making a few controversial statements.Here are the top 5 ways Democrats have refused to accept the legitimacy of the 2000 election:1. Al Gore's Recounts and Lawsuits: Of course, this list could be started nowhere else. Liberal partisans are currently in the grip of a nationwide mass delusion that Gore calmly accepted the results of the agonizingly tight presidential election, then passively waited for the results of an automatic mandatory recount before making his concession final. Nothing could be further from the truth.It's true that an important difference with Trump was that Gore didn't challenge the validity of the election in advance. (Then again, he didn't have widespread stories of voter fraud, illegal coordination between Super PACs and political campaigns, and activists caught bragging about how they engineered political violence to mull over.)But once that razor's-edge election was over, Gore retracted his concession and demanded recounts of only a few specific Florida counties, not the entire state. There was a mandatory machine recount of Florida votes, but Gore refused to accept it. Gore's reluctance to swiftly demand a manual statewide recount, instead of just the counties where he thought friendly election officials could manufacture a victory for him, was criticized as a major strategic error by legal experts at the time.Liberal history revisionists are hoping everyone will forget this, but Gore's strategy involved literally conjuring votes out of thin air - he was looking for ""undervotes,"" claiming that ballots where no one was chosen for President would be counted as Gore votes, in the Democrat counties of Broward, Dade, Palm Beach, and Volusia.Gore dragged the entire country through an agonizing legal nightmare for over a month, causing a significant delay in the Bush Administration's ability to get established in 2001... a year in which history, and Bill Clinton's feckless foreign policy, would give Bush a very busy September.Throughout this process, Gore's constant refrain was that he wanted ""every vote to be counted,"" which insinuated Bush was a villain who wanted to disenfranchise people, particularly black people. In a December 2000 update on the recount drama, the New York Times reported that Gore's team ""wanted to assess the reaction from its allies and see whether an outcry, particularly by black voters, might trigger enough public concern"" to sustain his refusal to concede the election.Gore fought like mad against his election lost, pulling out every trick in the book, and he kept going even after prominent Democrats began warning him that his resistance was damaging the integrity of the American election system -- several of them are quoted to that effect in the New York Times article linked above.When Al Gore appeared at a Hillary Clinton rally in Miami just last week, he mused darkly about ""what happened here in Florida"" and got the desired angry result from the crowd of Democrats, which ended up chanting ""You won! You won!"" -- accompanied by an approving nod from Hillary Clinton. Gore finished up by encouraging his audience to vote so that one day, in the years to come, they wouldn't be welcoming Hillary Clinton onstage and saying ""actually you did win, it just wasn't close enough to make sure that the votes were counted.""Sorry, Democrat propagandists, but Al Gore has never accepted the 2000 election as fully legitimate, not to this very day. Articles challenging the legitimacy of that election remain a staple of mainstream liberal publications.2. The War on Katherine Harris: Think Trump was out of line for calling Hillary Clinton a ""nasty woman"" in the third 2016 debate? That's nothing compared to the all-out misogynist war our tolerant and sensitive liberal friends waged against Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris in 2000. Her appearance, and especially her use of makeup, were relentlessly mocked. Try this on for size:Her lips were overdrawn with berry-red lipstick -- the creamy sort that smears all over a coffee cup and leaves smudges on shirt collars. Her skin had been plastered and powdered . . . . Caterpillars seemed to rise and fall with every bat of her eyelid. . . . Her mouth is a jagged edge. One of the reasons Harris is so easy to mock is because she, to be honest, seems to have applied her makeup with a trowel.That's not some foaming-at-the-mouth lefty blogger - that description of Harris was written by a Washington Post reporter, for the express purpose of justifying even more savage sexist attacks on Harris.Women's News racked up a few more of the insults directed at Harris in 2000:A Democratic operative labeled her Cruella de Vil, the villainess of ""102 Dalmatians,"" and the term got repeated everywhere. The Boston Globe said maybe she was planning to unwind at a drag bar, because of all her makeup, and the Boston Herald called her a painted lady. Jay Leno called the election ""tighter than Katherine Harris' face.""They also tried slut-shaming her by mocking the cleavage she displayed in TV appearances, to deafening silence from ""feminists.""Gore and his team attacked Harris professionally while Democrat minions were tearing her to shreds on a personal level. ""Gore's advisers have accused Harris, a Republican and a Bush supporter, of trying to hand the election to George W. Bush,"" ABC News reported in November 2000. Gore spokesman Mark Fabiani bluntly declared, ""Ms. Harris' attempt to steal this election will never stand."" How's that for assaulting the integrity of the U.S. election system, Clinton fans?3. Hillary Clinton Thinks Bush Was ""Selected, Not Elected"": While we're on the subject of Hillary Clinton, she's done a lot more than just nod along with Al Gore's ""I wuz robbed"" schtick.Senator Clinton literally said Bush was ""selected, not elected"" at a 2002 fundraiser.  When she was Secretary of State, she questioned the legitimacy of Bush's election in a speech overseas:Now, our democracy is still evolving. We had all kinds of problems in some of our past elections, as you might remember. In 2000, our presidential election came down to one state where the brother of the man running for president was the governor of the state, so I mean, we have our problems too. But we have been moving to try to remedy those problems as we see them.Her audience would have found nothing subtle about her ""brother of the man running for president was the governor of the state"" insinuation, given that she was speaking in Nigeria at the time.Clinton even peddled her Bush-Gore conspiracy theories right on the stage of this year's Democratic primary debates, when she declared, ""A court took away a presidency. Now we've got the Republican Congress trying to take away the Constitution, and we should not tolerate that."" CNN actually fact-checked this outburst and rated it ""False.""4. The Butterfly (Ballot) Effect: One of the Democrats' strategies for overturning the 2000 election was to claim that the ""butterfly ballot"" in Palm Beach County was too confusing for any reasonable person to figure out, causing many confused Gore voters to incorrectly cast their ballots for Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan. The liberal outrage machine was gearing up to portray this as an evil conspiracy to disenfranchise the befuddled Democrat voters of Palm Beach, but were brought up short by the discovery that the butterfly ballot was designed by a Democrat, elections supervisor Theresa LePore, who said she used a two-page layout so the type would be larger and easier to read. LePore nevertheless became the target of fury from Democrats in her area and was voted out of her office in 2004. The butterfly ballot has figured in attempts to delegitimize the 2000 election ever since it was held. For example, Florida Congressman Rob Wexler declared, ""I think it's fair to say Theresa LePore's mistake resulted in the wrong man becoming President.""Wexler was one of several Democrat heavyweights to work for LePore's defeat in 2004; others included Gore's running mate Joe Lieberman and another Democrat presidential contender, Vermont Governor Howard Dean. Her opponent, Arthur Anderson, said he ran to defend ""the right to have our vote count.""5. Disenfranchised Minority Voters: Racial conspiracies have long been a mainstay of Democrat assaults on the legitimacy of the 2000 election. Among the most persistent of these beliefs is that Florida police officers used roadblocks to keep black voters away from the polls. This wasn't just fever-swamp muttering from the far Left -- Florida Governor Jeb Bush was actually brought before the U.S. Civil Rights Commission to testify on the subject. Liberals ignored his testimony and continued to insist sinister forces denied minority voters in Florida their chance to elect Al Gore.Conspiracy theories about sinister voter-roll purges abound. The butterfly ballot and Gore's thwarted recount antics have been portrayed as racist conspiracies against blacks and Hispanics.Liberals have often referred to Bush's election as a ""coup"" over the years. Among the most energetic users of the term was Rev. Jesse Jackson. For example, he said the Supreme Court was a ""willing tool of the Bush campaign,"" which ""orchestrated a questionable velvet legal coup."" Jackson couched this charge in racialist terms and called for ""massive non-violent demonstrations"" on the Martin Luther King holiday in 2001.Jackson also called for the Justice Department to investigate the Florida vote, declaring ""there is widespread disgrace across the state,"" not just in the dangling-chad precincts of West Palm Beach.""This last vote caused a crisis in the credibility of this election. This is a crisis of integrity. We the American people deserve better. We should settle for nothing less,"" Jackson thundered. ""Florida is the Sunshine State. This ballot came out of the Bushes.""Al Sharpton has played this game as well. Running his own political campaign in 2003, he said that in 2000, ""Bush won the election at the Supreme Court, not in the electorate, but the reason he was able to do that is because there is no Constitutional right to vote.""Her lips were overdrawn with berry-red lipstick -- the creamy sort that smears all over a coffee cup and leaves smudges on shirt collars. Her skin had been plastered and powdered . . . . Caterpillars seemed to rise and fall with every bat of her eyelid. . . . Her mouth is a jagged edge. One of the reasons Harris is so easy to mock is because she, to be honest, seems to have applied her makeup with a trowel.A Democratic operative labeled her Cruella de Vil, the villainess of ""102 Dalmatians,"" and the term got repeated everywhere.

This is a crisis of integrity. We the American people deserve better. We should settle for nothing less,"" Jackson thundered. ""Florida is the Sunshine State.

One such speech was given to Deutsche Bank on April 24, 2013. There, she praised fracking as a tool to ""make even more countries more energy self-sufficient."" She told the audience: ""I've promoted fracking in other places around the world.""Yet, everything she's said in the campaign, paints a different picture.Her policies are decidedly anti-fossil fuel. The party platform calls for ""a goal of producing 100 percent of electricity from renewable sources by 2050."" In addition to promoting ""enough clean renewable energy to power every home in America within ten years,"" Hillary's website outlines her desire to ""reduce the amount of oil consumed in the United States and around the world."" She's declared that banning fossil fuel extraction on public lands is: ""a done deal."" While she won't come out and clearly state that she'd ban fracking, at a March 6 CNN debate with Bernie Sanders in Flint, Michigan, she proudly stated: ""By the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place."" And, she has pledged to ""stop fossil fuels.""Then there's her comment about green-group funding, as coming from Russia. It's long been suspected that Russia is protecting its national oil-and-gas interests by funding anti-fracking activism--while not a new idea, the current attention makes it worth revisiting.To the best of my knowledge, Russia's reported involvement in shaping public opinion came to light in 2010, when different WikiLeaks revelations made public private intelligence from Stratfor--which had previously published a background brief on Shale Gas Activism--that speculated on Russian funding for the anti-fracking movie Gasland.The idea that Russia is funding anti-fracking groups, such as the Sierra Club and the Natural Resource Defense Council, has popped up in a variety of outlets including the 2013 movie FrackNation, and in 2014 comments from NATO secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the former Prime Minister of Denmark. And then, in late 2014, the New York Times featured a story titled: ""Russian money suspected behind fracking protests."" In 2015, The Washington Free Beacon reported on a Bermudian firm that had connections to Russian oil interests and was funneling money to anti-fracking groups in the U.S.Despite all the multiple claims linking Russia to anti-fracking activity, there's been scant hard evidence.But now, thanks to WikiLeaks, Russia's reported anti-fracking funding is back in the headlines: ""Leaked emails show Hillary Clinton blaming Russians for funding 'phony' anti-fracking groups,"" wrote the Washington Times.With knowledge only someone with a high-level security clearance and an understanding of foreign relations, like the Secretary of State, would have, Hillary, in a June 2014 speech in Edmonton Canada, reportedly said the following to an audience:""We were up against Russia pushing oligarchs and others to buy media. We were even up against phony environmental groups, and I'm a big environmentalist, but these were funded by the Russians to stand against any effort, oh that pipeline, that fracking, whatever will be a problem for you, and a lot of the money supporting that message was coming from Russia.""Remember, we are in an economic war and there are many who don't want America to win. The cheap energy prices fracking has provided give the U.S. an economic advantage--hence the hostility toward it.""We were up against Russia pushing oligarchs and others to buy media. We were even up against phony environmental groups, and I'm a big environmentalist, but these were funded by the Russians to stand against any effort, oh that pipeline, that fracking, whatever will be a problem for you, and a lot of the money supporting that message was coming from Russia.""SIGN UP"	['Sanders', 'Clinton']	[]

In that it shares a border with Georgia and doesn't appear to have any laws.""SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAnd while the U.S public is mostly unfamiliar with the Russian state, Chechnya has been the subject of international scrutiny for nearly two decades. The epicenter of two catastrophic wars and a lengthy counterinsurgency campaign, Chechnya has spent the start of the new century battling fundamentalist Islamic terror, corruption, and crime.But nearly eight years after Russia responded to the Chechen threat of terrorism and separatism with a series of brutal bombing campaigns, Chechnya and its neighbors are seeing unprecedented levels of peace. Suicide bombings and kidnappings, once a daily part of life in the North Caucasus, are at their lowest numbers since the onset of the first war in 1993. And modest economic prosperity, fueled by Russian investment, is beginning to be felt by ordinary people.But the heavy-handed peace that Russia forged is tenuous at best.As the Kremlin becomes increasingly preoccupied with its commitments in both Syria and Ukraine, Chechnya is drifting to Moscow's periphery. With infrastructure investments being rerouted to pay for military operations and President Putin focused on bolstering the regime of Bashar al Assad, Chechnya has been left with less money and a looser leash on President Ramzan Kadyrov.Pushing Chechnya to the geopolitical back burner is a dangerous mistake, but Russia's missteps could be easily remedied.After the death of Kremlin critic Boris Nemtsov last February, Western officials were quick to point the blame at President Vladimir Putin -- but few Russia experts believe the assassination was ordered by Putin himself. After a brief investigation, five Chechens were implicated in Nemtsov's death, including Zaur Dadayev, a senior policeman whom Kadyrov called a ""true Russian patriot"" after the shooting.Instead, experts believe that the hit was ordered by Kadyrov in an attempt to impress his boss and demonstrate unwavering loyalty. Shortly after Nemtsov's death, Putin awarded Kadyrov a state medal, and almost a year later, Kadyrov posted a photo to his Instagram account of Kremlin opposition leaders Mikhail Kasyanov and Vladimir Kara-Murza in the crosshairs of a rifle.Adding to the speculation, Kadyrov publicly showed his reluctance to run in this year's Chechen presidential election for the first time ever, aggressively hinting at his desire to leave Grozny for a prominent role in the Kremlin instead.He seized the election with a narrow 97 percent margin and unsurprisingly, Putin passed on bringing Kadyrov to Moscow -- but he should embrace the opportunity.In Chechnya, Kadyrov is a liability.With his opulent palaces, brutal private security force (appropriately called the Kadyrovtsy), and penchant for unrestrained violence towards even the slightest perceived criticism, Kadyrov is drawing unnecessary attention to Putin's own less-than-stellar human rights track record.And as ISIS continues to freely recruit from Chechnya and its neighbors, bringing Kadyrov to Moscow as a special adviser could make use of his knowledge while simultaneously allowing Putin to install a less hostile leader in Grozny without insulting a loyal, albeit slightly over zealous, friend. Russia has a problem with radical Islam, which is why it needs someone like Kadyrov in Moscow.While the U.S was reminded about the problems in Chechnya in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon Bombing, when it was revealed that the perpetrators were displaced Chechens from Kyrgyzstan, Russia has been dealing with the threat of Chechen terrorism for years.The Beslan school siege where some 300 children were killed and the Moscow apartment bombings -- which prompted Russian military action into the North Caucasus -- serve as haunting reminders of the violence Russia has experienced in the last two decades.And after the explosion of Metrojet Flight 9268 over Egypt and the attempted murder of two Moscow policemen by supporters of Abu bakr al-Baghdadi, it's evident that Russia's terrorism problem hasn't gone away, and the country needs to secure its own backyard.Ramzan Kadyrov has benefited from being relegated to a minor afterthought by the Russians while simultaneously having their unmitigated support. It's allowed him to expand his private militia and run Chechnya more like a tribal warlord than President, amassing substantial personal power.But securing a country through unchecked brute force isn't a permanent solution and there is no contingency plan for what happens to Chechnya should Kadyrov be removed in one way or another. Kadyrov's father, the President of Chechnya prior to Ramzan's rule, was assassinated by a suicide bomb. If the status quo were to change or if Kadyrov loses support from Moscow, Chechnya's unresolved conflicts could destroy Putin's precarious peace.Bringing Kadyrov to Moscow would certainly elevate his standing, but Putin can't afford to alienate him and at the very least could benefit from his regional expertise. And by changing the leadership dynamics under his tight control, Putin could pre-empt the chaos that would come from Kadyrov's eventual departure, beginning the gentle process of Russian-style democratization.But Kadyrov's lack of self-control is only part of the problem. To secure the region and prevent the spread of ISIS supported terrorism, Moscow should refocus its strategic operations in the North Caucasus and increase its military forces in Chechnya.Residual Russian special forces, primarily focused on Chechnya's border regions, put enough pressure on the region to squeeze Islamists into Syria and Iraq. Displaced Chechen jihadists have found substantial success in the ranks of ISIS, and with Russia showing no signs of slowing down operations in Syria, Putin could effectively kill two birds with one drone.Chechnya's peace largely also rests on its relative economic prosperity. With Russia pulling away from infrastructure investment projects, it runs the risk of bringing back a more traditional Caucasian industry- kidnapping and organized crime.If oil and gas prices would begin to rise as a global glut abates, Moscow could take the opportunity to once again explore additional pipelines and energy infrastructure investments from neighboring Dagestan through Chechnya.Located near the oil-rich Caspian Sea and hurting from the same war wounds as Chechnya, Dagestan's poor economic situation and porous borders has been both a breeding ground and sanctuary for terrorists. Focusing on economic revitalization projects and Caspian oil exploration could ensure that Moscow's hard-won peace wasn't just built on sand.Russia's brutal success in Chechnya is best likened to the Calgacus quote about Roman military strategy: ""They made a desert and called it peace.""But the Kremlin's expectation, to create new deserts in Syria and Ukraine without taking measures to create long-term stability in its own backyard, is misguided hubris.Daria Judge is a graduate student in international affairs at George Washington University.SIGN UP"	[]	[]

Clinton Foundation Can’t Escape Malfeasance Charges	"Even before Peter Schweizer's book Clinton Cash hit bookshelves, Hillary Clinton and her campaign team repeatedly attacked the book's findings and may have coordinated with major media outlets in an attempt to discredit it.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe efforts to discredit the book and the related news stories from organizations such as Media Matters and Politico have been extensive and determined.Once the information about Clinton Foundation malfeasance was made public, it sent shockwaves through the not-for-profit community. Philanthropy has not only become big ""business"" over the decades, but the industry has worked hard to build extensive standards and ethical guidelines intended to protect the public from fraud and abuse.The Lilly Family School of Philanthropy at the Indiana University campus in Indianapolis has become the MIT of philanthropy studies. Its Chronicle of Philanthropy is the guidepost for professional philanthropic activity. And many websites have emerged to help evaluate and rate private charities and give the public solid information to help them make wise decisions in their generous giving. CharityNavigator.org is considered the gold-standard for this information. And as the allegations against the Clintons began to emerge as valid criticism, Charity Navigator found itself in the crosshairs of the Clintons and their surrogates.In March of 2015, Charity Navigator, reviewing the organization's activity and in light of the news reports surrounding the release of Clinton Cash, placed the Clinton Foundation on its red-flag watch list. This initially gave credibility to the concerns raised in the book, and put Bill and HIllary Clinton in a precarious situation because of the website's pristine reputation.New York Magazine reports that the Clintons and their surrogates put heavy pressure on Charity Navigator trying to get the Foundation off the watchlist. The pressure seems to have been heavy and persistent, and apparently had the desired effect.Last year, Charity Navigator removed the Foundation from its watch list after it released its 2014 IRS statement (Form 990). The group kept the initial warning page up for a time but eventually took it down. Speculation arose over the release of the 990 about fixing the books of the Foundation. This claim is denied, but new evidence has come to light which seem to reveal problems within the organization were widespread and greatly concerning.In recent WikiLeaks revelations, problems exposed within the Clinton Foundation may be showing Charity Navigator's first instinct was correct. New revelations about a ""governance review"" of the Clinton Foundation reveal the breadth of problems within the Foundation's operations which in key points confirm the findings of Clinton Cash. And it includes the fact that donors to the Foundation had an expectation of a ""quid pro quo"" return from the Clintons because of their gifts.The audit, commissioned by Chelsea Clinton, was conducted by New York law firm Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett, LLC in December 2011, revealed major problems with financial irregularities, board makeup, accountability standards and potential misuse of funds. It started a feud between Chelsea and Clinton Foundation executive Doug Band.Bombshell revelations in the report were revealed in the report. The firm's findings of pay-for-play contributions to the Foundation and its criticism of the ""small insider board"" which provided little or no oversight of the operations of the Foundation including the appropriate use of funds.The review points to numerous areas where the Clinton Foundation ignored ""best practices"" for a not-for-profit. This prompted recommendations by Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett for serious changes in their operations. This included establishing an independent Advisory Board to initiate independent audits, implementing controls for how money is spent, implementing a conflict-of-interest policy and changing the way employees are compensated and correcting the conflicts of their employment with outside organizations.The firm stressed that the board provide stronger management of the organization. They pointed to the fact that the board rarely met and gave little guidance to how the Foundation should be managed. The problem was so concerning to employees that they rated the effectiveness of the organization in the ""low 1-4 level"" on a scale of 1 to 10.The review pointed to a lack of management of conflicts-of-interest with severe improvements needed to improve internal controls on spending and expense reimbursements pointing to a concerning misuse of funds. This included a concern that the Foundation might be running afoul of IRS rules requiring non-business related expenses be reported as taxable income.The report stated that, ""numerous [employees] commented that they believe that the Board
needs to take a more active role in overseeing and managing the Foundation and its finances,
programs, and activities.""The report also pointed to concerns that the Foundation could be running afoul of the law if it did not expand the board moving from one ""comprised solely of 'insiders'"" to one made up of outsiders who could better review the activities of the organization.They urged them to appoint an independent Audit Committee which could hire an outside auditing firm to review problems of a lack of controls, develop a system to allow for ""whistleblower complaints involving financial matters,"" and review conflict-of-interest policies.A major red flag they pointed to was that the board didn't meet until the middle of the year to review the budget. And they strongly asserted ""this weakness was not corrected even after being noted by auditors.""Jim Pfaff is a former Chief of Staff on Capitol Hill and is President and CEO of Innovative Research and Data Solutions, a political, business and telecommunications consulting firm.

""While the abortion industry claims that late-term abortions are an insignificant number of abortions and they're only done because of a disability the baby has or to protect the life of the mother, the evidence says just the opposite.""Research published by the Guttmacher Institute also finds that most late-term abortions were not done for medical reasons - as the abortion lobby often states. Fetal abnormalities ""make up a small minority"" of late-term abortions, and those for saving the life of the mother are even less.According to the study:Most women seeking later abortion fit at least one of five profiles: They were raising children alone, were depressed or using illicit substances, were in conflict with a male partner or experiencing domestic violence, had trouble deciding and then had access problems, or were young and nulliparous [never given birth].""The abortion industry denies the science of fetal development and continues to advocate for aborting fully developed, viable children who can feel the pain of the abortionist's needle that's used to kill them,"" Rose asserts..@hillaryclinton is #InOurCorner on #reprohealth & rights.

Anthony List president Marjorie Dannenfelser says is ""a loophole so big as to make the underlying restriction meaningless.""Dannenfelser explained at National Review:It applies to anyone who claims to feel ""mental distress"" at the thought of having a baby. And it's hard to take seriously the idea that a woman who stood by as her husband vetoed a law to prohibit the gruesome practice of partial-birth abortion now opposes the very abortions the technique was designed to administer.Nevertheless, Clinton received some criticism from the abortion lobby - which is helping fund her campaign - for daring to even mention any type of restriction or ""regulation"" on abortion.Planned Parenthood and its political allies claim abortion is a woman's right up until the baby's due date, and they consistently fight state and federal restrictions on late-term abortions. Although some states have restricted late-term abortions, Live Action observes all states allow abortion into the ninth month for certain exceptions, and eight states allow abortion until birth for any reason (Colorado, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington State).A recent Marist College Institute for Public Opinion poll finds four-fifths of Americans favor some restrictions on abortion -- including limiting the procedure after the first three months -- and a continued ban on public funding of abortion.In the survey of 1,700 Americans, even 66 percent of respondents who identify themselves as pro-choice say, ""Abortion should be allowed, at most, in the first trimester, in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother, or never permitted.""Update:The Guttmacher Institute is reporting that the states that allow abortion until birth for any reason are now Alaska, Colorado, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, and Vermont. Washington, D.C. allows abortion up until birth for any reason as well.Most women seeking later abortion fit at least one of five profiles: They were raising children alone, were depressed or using illicit substances, were in conflict with a male partner or experiencing domestic violence, had trouble deciding and then had access problems, or were young and nulliparous [never given birth]..@hillaryclinton is #InOurCorner on #reprohealth & rights.

Seder could not.Later, Seder brought up the well-worn accusation that video from O'Keefe's ACORN sting in 2009 had been misleading, because of a fur coat that O'Keefe wore in a whimsical introductory shot that he did not actually wear to any of his meetings with ACORN.As O'Keefe pointed out to Seder on Wednesday, the fur coat had nothing to do with the video footage that had been recorded on hidden camera.Seder challenged O'Keefe to show the full raw footage of the hidden camera videos in his recent investigation. O'Keefe noted that he was being held to a higher standard than other journalists, and that the Democratic National Committee had tacitly admitted the validity of his reporting by firing two officials linked to the ""bird-dogging.""The videos O'Keefe has released thus far also show a Democratic consultant claiming that the Hillary Clinton campaign used a system of text messages among consultants -- a ""Pony Express"" -- to coordinate between the campaign and the super PACs.The White House on Wednesday attempted to downplay the relationship between President Barack Obama and Robert Creamer, the Chicago organizer at the heart of the new revelations.O'Keefe responded in a statement to Breitbart News that warned: ""We have hours and hours of footage, including audio recordings of phone calls between Robert Creamer and the White House.""Joel B.

If Hopkins' leadership refuses to censor the study, ""its Healthcare Equality Index score will be reduced substantially,"" the LGBTQ group stated.To their credit, University officials replied that while they remain committed to supporting the LGBT community they are also committed to academic freedom.In a letter to the Johns Hopkins Medicine community, Paul B. Rothman, dean of the medical faculty, and Ronald R. Peterson, president of Johns Hopkins Health System, defended the right of scholars to publish their findings.As an academic medical research institution, they wrote, ""academic freedom is among our fundamental principles -- essential to the self-correcting nature of scientific inquiry, and a privilege that we safeguard.""Academic freedom, the officials noted, is ""designed to afford members of the community the broadest possible scope for unencumbered expression, investigation, analysis, and discourse.""The scholars conducting the study bear the highest credentials in the field. Dr. Paul R. McHugh is arguably the most important American psychiatrist of the last half-century, and served as director of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science at Johns Hopkins University for 27 years. Importantly, during McHugh's tenure, the institute pioneered work with transgender individuals.McHugh's co-author is Dr. Lawrence S. Mayer, an epidemiologist trained in psychiatry and a scholar in residence at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.In their 116-page report, the scholars analyzed research from the biological, psychological, and social sciences, and concluded that many of the most frequently heard claims about sexuality and gender are not supported by scientific evidence.""Some of the most widely held views about sexual orientation, such as the 'born that way' hypothesis, simply are not supported by science. The literature in this area does describe a small ensemble of biological differences between non-heterosexuals and heterosexuals, but those biological differences are not sufficient to predict sexual orientation, the ultimate test of any scientific finding,"" the report said.Ever faithful to its agenda, the Human Rights Campaign wants to bully Johns Hopkins into stifling free scientific inquiry when the results run contrary to its deeply held beliefs and desires. It is willing to punish a world-class institution for protecting academic freedom.Fortunately, officials at Johns Hopkins seem to have enough integrity to reject these heavy-handed attempts, at least for now.Follow Thomas D.

Yes, Gore eventually accepted the result -- but only after withdrawing his concession, trying to have the vote recounted only in Democrat-heavy Florida counties, and suing to stop ballots from being recounted. Even after a consortium of media outlets concluded that George W. Bush had indeed won more votes in Florida, Democrats continued to claim the election had been ""stolen"" by the Supreme Court and Bush was an illegitimate president.2. 2004: John Kerry and ""rigged"" machines. While Kerry conceded the election, he and his running mate continued to believe afterwards that the election had been stolen from them, possibly by voting machines. Elizabeth Edwards said in 2007 that she had been ""very disappointed"" in Kerry's decision to concede the election. And last year the New Yorker reported that Kerry believed ""proxies for Bush had rigged many voting machines"" in Ohio, and that he may in fact have won the election.3. 2008: John Podesta and Obama's voter fraud. As the Wall Street Journal pointed out recently, President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder have suggested that voter ID laws are a way of rigging elections against black people. And while they downplay fears of voter fraud, Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta reported internally (via Wikileaks) in 2015 that Clinton operatives believed that ""the Obama forces flooded the caucuses with ineligible voters"" to win the primary.4. 2014: Congress and a ""rigged"" district system. Thanks to the Tea Party wave election in 2010 in response to Obamacare, Republicans were left in charge of many state legislatures as they redrew congressional district boundaries. Except in a few states -- such as Illinois, where Democrats drew several Republicans out of their seats -- that meant Republicans held the advantage in the House. As a result, Democrats complained bitterly that congressional elections were ""rigged"" against them.5. 2016: Bernie Sanders and a ""rigged"" primary. Sanders uses the word ""rigged"" often to describe the economic system. But in 2016, the Democratic Party primary was rigged against him in a political sense -- both openly, in the party's anti-democratic super delegate system, and secretly, through collusion between party officials and the Clinton campaign. Sanders supporters protested at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia against what they called a ""rigged"" election.Hillary Clinton herself has made at least one similar claim. National Review -- which officially opposed Trump earlier this year -- points out that Clinton told a private fundraiser in 2002 that George W. Bush had been ""selected,"" not ""elected.""Joel B.

And the second is RedState's Erick Erickson, who declared in February: ""I Will Not Vote for Donald Trump. Ever."" That, of course, was omitted from the AP's report, which was widely reprinted across local news outlets and which tends to suggest that Trump did so poorly in the debate that he lost his own core base of conservative voters.The reality is quite different.Pro-life conservatives were very happy with Trump's performance in the debate, especially his attack on partial-birth abortion, which Hillary Clinton struggled to defend.Talk show host Laura Ingraham and former Arkansas Gov.

Mike Flynn: Trump’s ‘Unbelievable Victory’ Is ‘Exactly What We Needed’	"LAS VEGAS, Nevada -- Retired Army Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn tells Breitbart News he thinks Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's ""unbelievable victory"" in the final presidential debate against his Democratic opponent was ""exactly what we needed.""SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""I think this was an unbelievable victory for Trump,"" Flynn, a top Trump surrogate, said in an exclusive interview.I think this was amazing. He was so on point, so on message. He gave very precise answers. You listen, for those that watched it tonight, you saw a robot-like script coming out of Hillary Clinton with no new ideas. No new ideas at all. Donald Trump gave some amazing ideas tonight and he showed America what he's going to do for jobs. He showed America what he's going to do to help out our immigration and all the kinds of things we're involved in.Flynn says he was shocked at Hillary Clinton's claims in the debate that she doesn't support open borders, when a transcript of a paid speech she gave to a Brazilian bank shows she specifically said she supports ""open borders"" and ""open trade.""""She's totally for open borders,"" Flynn told Breitbart News.Just look at what's in her emails that have come out. She wants like a United States of North America not a United States of America. She would prefer to have just wide open like they have over in Europe right now. If you don't have any borders you don't have a country. This was an unbelievable victory for Donald Trump. It was exactly what we needed. So from our standpoint this is exactly what this camp needed because we are going to have so much momentum going into the final weeks of this election and this was exactly what we wanted tonight.Trump hammered Clinton in the debate multiple times on her support for open borders.""Hillary wants to give amnesty,"" Trump said at one point.She wants to have open borders. The border -- as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me. First time they've ever endorsed a candidate. It means their job is tougher. But they know what's going on. They know it better than anybody. They want strong borders. They feel we have to have strong borders.Later, when he hit her again on that point, he said it is ""very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders. You would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders.""A rattled Clinton fired back at Trump that she doesn't support open borders.""We will not have open borders,"" she said. ""That is a rank mischaracterization.""In a follow-up question further drilling down on the matter, moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News asked Clinton about the transcripts of the speech from the Brazilian bank she was paid to speak at where she did indeed say she supports open borders.""Secretary Clinton, I want to clear up your position on this issue, because in a speech you gave to a Brazilian bank, for which you were paid $225,000, we've learned from the WikiLeaks, that you said this, and I want to quote. 'My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.' So that's the question,"" Wallace asked Clinton. ""That's the question. Please quiet, everybody. Is that your dream, open borders?""Clinton admitted the transcript was in fact legitimate, and then claimed she was talking about energy policy, nothing else.""Well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy,"" she said. ""You know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined. And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders. I think that would be a great benefit to us.""Then she deflected into attacking the WikiLeaks publication of now tens of thousands of pages of emails from her campaign chairman John Podesta.Gen. Flynn was also pleased that Trump called on Clinton to return the money the Clinton Foundation has taken from Middle Eastern regimes oppressive to women and gays. Clinton specifically dodged the question from Trump on that matter.""I think that--I'm so glad that he said that,"" Flynn told Breitbart News. ""Those countries abuse women and abuse gays, come on! And she's taking money from them and she professes to be for women and gays. Come on.""In that exchange, Trump said that the Clinton Foundation is ""a criminal enterprise.""""Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries,"" Trump said to Clinton during the debate.You talk about women and women's rights? So these are people that push gays off business -- off buildings. These are people that kill women and treat women horribly. And yet you take their money. So I'd like to ask you right now, why don't you give back the money that you've taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly? Why don't you give back the money?
