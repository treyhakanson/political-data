Limbaugh then countered Obama by pointing out that Operation Fast and Furious was, in fact, a focused attempt to make Americans clamor for Obama to come after certain types of weapons via stringent gun control.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERLimbaugh summed up the basics of Fast and Furious by reminding listeners it was an operation wherein guns were intentionally purchased in Phoenix, Arizona, to be smuggled into Mexico. The guns would ubiquitously be traced as they went into Mexico, with the stated purpose that this tactic would lead to cartel members who could then be apprehended.It should be noted that the guns in Phoenix were purchased via ""straw purchases,"" whereby the buyer knew he was not buying the guns for himself but for the persons to whom they would be smuggled. Such purchases are illegal, but were allowed by Obama's DOJ/ATF because acquiring the guns was key to the operation. Moreover, it should also be noted that the guns purchased in Phoenix were not only ""major assault weapons""-so hated by the left-but also .50 caliber rifles.Limbaugh indicated that the Obama administration's real goals for Fast and Furious were not necessarily the stated goals. Instead, he believes the real goal of the operation was to have the guns create enough havoc on the border that Americans would beg for the government to institute more gun control.Limbaugh said:They wanted the American public to demand tougher gun control laws. They know they can't go take guns out of the hands of people. They know there's the Second Amendment-if they could get rid of it they would, but they can't. There are too many Democrats that are not going to vote for something like that, so the way they do it is to try to create a mass hysteria.Limbaugh went on to explain that Fast and Furious backfired because the program was discovered-and the goals of the program deduced-before the hysteria could be caused.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of ""Bullets with AWR Hawkins,"" a Breitbart News podcast.

The DOJ comment specifically counsels against communicating with voters and ""challenging them"", plus the capture of still and video images is also mentioned. The statement does not grant the varying distinctions in which states may allow communication between voters and poll watchers, nor does the DOJ note that some observers in specific states do indeed have the power to challenge would-be voters based on documented ineligibility. As a point of fact, some states--Missouri as an example--specifically call election observers ""challengers"", according to local statutes.The lacking distinctions and threats carefully directed at the vigilant voter do not occur in a vacuum. Though it is normal for law enforcement agencies at many levels to share contact information prior to an election in a ""see-something-say-something"" capacity, the national discussion spurred by Donald Trump regarding a combination of concerns related to rigged elections and poll watching further underscores the DOJ's curious language used to warn against organized election integrity efforts.Despite Delaware U.S. Attorney Charles M. Oberly, III's assurances that, ""Every citizen must be able to vote without interference or discrimination and to have that vote counted without it being stolen because of fraud,"" the DOJ Civil Rights Division's record of bringing violators to justice is virtually non-existent in recent memory. The last voter intimidation case brought was against members of the New Black Panther Party shortly before the inauguration of Barack Obama after a video surfaced of a poll watcher brandishing a nightstick outside of a Philadelphia polling place. The Holder DOJ effectively dropped the case after the defendant defaulted on it. Prior to that, the Justice Department in 2005 accused a black Democrat county chairman in rural Mississippi of committing intimidating and discriminatory acts against white voters.The U.S. Attorney from Delaware explains that like seen in previous elections, his office will be coordinating with FBI field offices and the Voting Section of the DOJ Civil Rights Division to respond to voter complaints. Concerned voters are encouraged to contact officials directly with an online complaint form.Logan Churchwell is the Assistant Editor and a founding member of the Breitbart Texas team.

All the blood is drained from the animal after slaughter because Islamic law forbids the consumption of blood.Research shows that electric shocks lessen the pain felt by animals when their throats are cut.Animals must be stunned under European Union regulations, but there is an exception for those who oppose the practice due to religious beliefs.About 2.4 million sheep and goats were put to death using the religious method in halal and kosher slaughterhouses in 2013, a 60 percent increase from 2011.Thirty-seven percent of sheep and goats, 25 percent of cattle and 16 percent of poultry were killed in this way in halal slaughterhouses.Researchers from the University of Bristol School of Veterinary Science asked Islamic scholars and Halal consumers about their opinion of pre-slaughter stunning. Sixty-nine percent of scholars said they did not agree that stunning before slaughter would reduce the pain felt by animals, according to the Daily Mail.However, more than 95 percent of the scholars and 53 percent of consumers agreed that if stunning did not result in death, cause physical injury or obstruct bleed-out, the meat would be considered Halal.Islamic law has also denied deeming meat as halal because of its name in certain countries.In Malaysia, food outlets were forced to rename ""hot dogs"" or risk being refused halal certification because dogs are considered unclean according to Islamic law.SIGN UP"	[]	[]

""Taken two of our people and asking for a fortune for their release. This doesn't happen if I'm president!""Well, Iran has done it again. Taken two of our people and asking for a fortune for their release. This doesn't happen if I'm president!-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2016Trump's message appeared to be in response to the taking of two more U.S. citizens by the Iranian regime and their intention to extract ""many billions of dollars"" in exchange for their release. Father and son, Baquer and Siamak Namazi, were sentenced to ten years in prison last Tuesday and slapped with a $4.8 million fine.Siamak, 45, was detained on October 15, 2015, during a visit to Iran. His father, Baquer, 80, was arrested on February 22, 2016. He was apparently lured to Iran over his son's detention, which led to his arrest. Baquer's arrest took place just six weeks after the release of Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, Pastor Saeed Abedini, Marine veteran Amir Hekmati and the mysterious Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari.Seven Iranians held in America's prison system were also released in that exchange, at the Iranian regime's request, and had pardons or charges against them dropped.The dual U.S.-Iranian citizens were reportedly part of a ransom exchange in which hundreds of millions of dollars were delivered into the clutches of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in exchange for the Americans captives. The Iranian regime has sentenced at least six more hostages, including the Namazis, to ten-year prison terms in the past few months.The move is largely seen as emboldening the regime and providing it with an incentive to take more Western hostages, as indicated by the arrest of Mr. Namazi and several others since that exchange.Iran's Mashregh News outlet, which appears to have ties to the IRGC, wrote on Tuesday that the Iranian regime will ""have to wait and see,"" and that ""Americans will offer several billions of dollars for their release,"" referring to the Namazis.Trump has also insisted that if he becomes president, the IRGC will no longer be able to threaten American vessels without facing dire consequences. Speaking at a rally in Florida last month, Trump said, ""With Iran, when they circle our beautiful destroyers with their little boats and they make gestures at our people that they shouldn't be allowed to make, they will be shot out of the water.""His remarks were in reference to the seizure of two U.S. Navy vessels by the IRGC in January and the subsequent detention of ten U.S. sailors who were on board those vessels located near Iran's Farsi Island, which is home to an IRGC military base.The high-seas spectacle took place just a few short days before Rezaian and the other U.S. hostages were released on January 16 and the United States and European nations lifted oil and financial sanctions on Iran, releasing about $100 billion of its assets in accordance with the nuclear Iran deal, otherwise known as the Joint-Comprehension Plan of Action (JCPOA).The discourse surrounding provocations from Iran has been a consistent theme throughout the 2016 presidential race, and it is reminiscent of the 1980 presidential race between Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan in which the Iranian hostage crisis elevated Reagan's lead and took him to the White House.Carter's deeply damaged legacy rests on the shoulders of his mishandling of the 1979 hostage crisis, which coincided with the revolution that overthrew Iran's last Shah and replaced him with Muslim hardliner Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.Reagan beat Carter in a landslide, one year and two days after the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis began. He had started off his campaign trailing far behind Carter in the polls. But as November inched closer, he swept the election in a landslide, beating Carter by nearly ten percentage points. Current polls have Trump leading Clinton by two points, and some others have her six points ahead.Clinton strongly endorsed the nuclear Iran deal and suggests she would take a ""distrust and verify"" approach to its enforcement, whereas Trump has been a vocal opponent of both the deal and the Iranian regime and has stated that he would either renegotiate or dismantle the deal altogether should he win the presidency.Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope @AdelleNaz.Well, Iran has done it again.

After all, he is a man who reacted to the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre by ""[devoting] his life to the cause of tightening gun regulations by increasing background checks and closing the gun-show loophole,"" even though background checks already existed at the time of the attack and the guns were not acquired at a gun show; they were stolen.The attempted murder of Kelly's wife, Gabby Giffords, also motivates the gun control push, even though Giffords' attacker, Jared Loughner, passed a background check to acquire his gun. So, in the end, Kelly is fervently pushing regulations that would not have hindered, much less prevented, the Sandy Hook attack or the attack on Giffords.But Thrush admires Kelly because Kelly takes time to talk ""to protesters"" who oppose passing more restrictions on the Second Amendment. Thrush quoted Kelly as saying:I'll walk across the street. I walked across the street to the gun show. So, I mean, that's why I like to engage with them, and sometimes it usually doesn't go so well right in the beginning. But if I stand there and listen and then engage them in a positive way -- and I understand these people, I own guns -- usually, by the end, it's a pretty positive experience for all of us.One of the greatest ironies of Kelly's background check campaign is that the requirements for our current background check system twice stopped him from purchasing a gun in 2013.On April 3, 2013, Breitbart News reported:Mark Kelly went to Tucson, Arizona's Diamondback Police Supply in February 2013 to show that ""background checks are easy.""  Kelly brought in a Texas ID instead of an Arizona ID and was denied because the current background check system stipulates that you can only purchase a handgun in the state within which you reside.Kelly returned with an Arizona ID 13 days later and passed the background check for a 1911-style handgun. He then released a hidden-camera video of how easy it was to purchase the gun but made no mention of the fact that his first attempt was refused.Breitbart News also reported that Kelly's highly publicized AR-15 purchase was terminated by Diamond Back Police Supply, as well. Kelly tried to purchase an AR-15 that was on hold for 20 days because it was a trade-in firearm. During the holding period, Kelly made such a show of his attempt to buy the rifle-telling CNN's Wolf Blitzer his plan was to hand the gun over to someone else all along-that Diamondback Police Supply owner Douglas MacKinlay canceled the purchase and refunded Kelly's money.MacKinlay's basis for canceling the order was question 11a of background check form 4473, which requires a gun purchaser to attest that he is buying the firearm for himself.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of ""Bullets with AWR Hawkins,"" a Breitbart News podcast.

Foval described Democracy Partners as a contractor for the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook tried to evade the controversy by denying a direct link between Creamer and the campaign.When Breitbart News' Washington political editor, Matthew Boyle, confronted Mook about Creamer and his firm in the spin room after the third presidential debate, Mook claimed: ""They've never worked for our campaign."" When asked if Clinton had ever discussed the controversial political operations with Creamer directly, Mook replied: ""I don't think so.""Now, however, O'Keefe and Project Veritas have released video of Creamer claiming that Clinton directly approved one of his more bizarre plans -- an effort to attract media attention and incite violence by dressing an activist in a Donald Duck costume and sending that activist into Trump events, emphasizing the argument that Trump was ""ducking"" releasing his tax returns.Creamer has also been closely linked with the White House and with President Barack Obama himself. He is listed as having visited the White House some 342 times since Obama took office, 47 of which were with Obama himself.Robert Creamer (Screenshot / Project Veritas)Last week, White House deputy spokesperson Eric Schultz declined to explain those visits: ""I'm not sure that I can describe [their relationship] because I'm not sure that there's much of one,"" he said.In response to the denials, O'Keefe told Breitbart News: ""We have hours and hours of footage, including audio recordings of phone calls between Robert Creamer and the White House.""Joel B.

The effort to enforce the Selective Service Registration law was abandoned in 1986 in favor of an all-volunteer Armed Forces.The U.S. military has sustained the longest continuous era of ground combat in American history by offering more competitive pay and benefits. But with the growing technical sophistication of modern missions, the military has also been offering enlistment and re-enlistment bonuses to fill key military occupation specialties (MOS).To support deployments at the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, a temporary Recruiting Assistance Program was instituted in 2005 to offer bigger bonuses for to encourage enlistment and re-enlistments for difficult to fill specialties including noncommissioned officers, intelligence experts, and civil affairs administrators.National Guard also started paying recruiting assistants (RAs) cash bonuses of up to $2,000 for qualifying RAP enlistments. The RAs received the first $1,000 when the qualifying recruit enlisted and the balance when the soldier shipped off for training.Obama Administration audits in 2010 determined there was a problem with RAP ""improper payments."" A task force formed with investigators from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Major Fraud Section, Army Criminal Investigative Command, and the Defense Criminal Investigative Services found thousands of bonuses and student loan payments were extended for Guard enlistees that did not qualify for RAP cash.The Obama Administration has stated that over 1,200 Army recruiters and 2,000 recruiter assistants are suspected of fraudulently granting 106,364 unqualified RAP payments to individuals. More than 200 officers are under investigation for knowledge of illegal RAP payments, including two generals and dozens of colonels.The Pentagon's National Guard Bureau has acknowledged that the RAP ""bonus overpayments"" occurred in every state National Guard unit. But California as the nation's largest National Guard contingent with 17,000 active members, appears to have made the largest number of unqualified RAP payments.According to California Guard audit official Colonel Michael S. Piazzoni, from fall of 2007 and to about October 2009, ""The system paid everybody up front, and then we spent the next five years figuring out if they were eligible.""Director of the Army Lt. Gen. William Grisoli told Stars & Stripes newspaper, investigators believe that up to $100 million in taxpayer money was lost to fraudulent RAP payments. About 104 criminal cases of recruiter incentive fraud have been adjudicated and 16 people have been imprisoned, including five National Guard recruiter assistants that each collected over $1 million in fraudulent bonuses.California National Guard's incentives manager Army Master Sgt. Toni Jaffe, pleaded guilty to the biggest recruitment fraud case in 2011, involving $15.2 million in ""false claims against the United States."" She was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison and 3 Guard officers also pled guilty to criminal fraud. They all agreed to pay restitution.With Lt. Gen. William Grisoli stated that the Army intends to recoup as much RAP taxpayer money as possible from the unsuspecting soldiers that did not know they were receiving unqualified RAP payments.Nearly 10,000 California National Guard soldiers, many veterans of multiple combat tours, have now been ordered to repay their re-enlistment bonuses and interest charges. As a sign of the military collector aggressiveness, there are increasing reports of California National Guard soldiers being hit with wage garnishments and tax liens.SIGN UP"	['Obama']	[]

He added that they were detained carrying fake Turkish passports.He said interrogations of the suspects revealed some of their comrades in arms had already left Jordan for Tunisia, at least two of them with French passports. He said that the information was forwarded to an international headquarters, operated by Middle Eastern and European intelligence services, which monitors the movement of former IS militants leaving battlegrounds in Syria, Iraq's Mosul and until recently Libya's Sirte.He also said that some European jihadists may have successfully returned to their countries of origin and are being searched for by local intelligence agencies.The official said that despite heightened measures along the Syrian-Turkish border, the area remains the jihadists' favorite escape route. He added that a passport counterfeit industry is still underway in Turkey, after Turkey turned a blind eye while the battle against IS was at its apex.The official said that the information collected during the interrogations of militants in Jordan and Tunisia led to raids by Turkish forces in border areas and in Istanbul.He said that the Jordanian border is much more tightly sealed, and the few militants who do cross it are often nabbed by the Jordanian intelligence. What's more, tribal elements in Jordan have been instrumental in curbing jihadists who have found refuge with Jordanian Salafists, he added.The official also said that one of the detainees, an Egyptian, was caught carrying a large sum of money, which prompted the authorities to believe that the fugitives are planning to build terror infrastructure in other countries, and that many of them still hold on to their pledge of allegiance to IS and its leader, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi.SIGN UP	['Jordan']	[]

The email was publicly released as part of the ongoing WikiLeaks revelations from Podesta's private email account.The article focused on the gridlocked Federal Election Commission, suggesting that it would be unable to enforce policies against election abuse. Clinton appeared concerned that Republicans would take advantage of the commission deadlock to raise more money than her campaign.Podesta admitted that the campaign needed to do more to compete with Republicans, specifically by focusing efforts on the officially endorsed Super PAC Priorities USA.""Get Priorities functional. Use this to scare our people into giving bigger sums,"" he wrote.He also advised that it might be time to rely on Bill Clinton and Barack Obama to encourage bigger donations to the Super PAC, but added that the president was ""prissy"" about the ethics behind it.""We may need to get WJC into the mix sooner,"" Podesta wrote to Clinton. ""We should also ask BHO to do more in light of this, although they are kind of prissy about how they approach this.""Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook agreed. Raise as much money as possible and trash opponents if they cross the lines.""I think we focus hard on raising as much as we can and then throw the kitchen sink at everyone who we believe steps over the line, understanding that has limited impact,"" he wrote.The Clinton campaign, however, spent a lot of time plotting for ways to stretch election laws to coordinate with Priorities USA.In one email, campaign aides discussed using the pro-choice advocacy group EMILY's List to send ""smoke signals"" for ad campaigns.Clinton's attorneys also focused on how campaign aides could legally refer donors to make bigger donations to Priorities USA.SIGN UP"	['Clinton', 'Obama']	[]

Nor does the base care at all about supposed conservative principles like small government.What Republican voters wanted, instead, were candidates who channeled their anger and fear, who demonized nonwhites and played into dark conspiracy theories. (Even establishment candidates did that -- never forget that Mr. Rubio accused President Obama of deliberately hurting America.)Just in case you had any doubts about that political reality, a Bloomberg poll recently asked Republicans whose view better matched their own view of what the party should stand for: Paul Ryan or Donald Trump. The answer was Mr. Trump, by a wide margin.This lesson hasn't been lost on Republican politicians. Even if Mr. Trump loses bigly, they'll know that their personal fortunes will depend on maintaining an essentially Trumpist line. Otherwise they will face serious primary challenges and/or be at risk of losing future elections when base voters stay home.Read the rest here. SIGN UP	['Paul', 'Trump', 'Rubio', 'Obama']	[]

Many of these proposed changes are medically unnecessary, unconstitutional and clearly designed to further impede a woman's ability to make the deeply personal decision to seek safe, legal abortion.Planned Parenthood South Atlantic is committed to patient health and safety and we continually seek out ways to improve patient care. Yet many of DHEC's proposed regulations are medically unnecessary and would turn back the clock on women's health. Restrictions like requiring husband's consent, admitting privileges, denying minors' judicial bypass and mandating surgical-facility requirements, are all blatantly unconstitutional. These restrictions among others- such as mandatory STI testing no matter the woman's circumstances- are intended to shame women and put barriers in their way of seeking constitutionally protected medical care. Simply put, the regulations are based in politics, not medicine.""We stand with South Carolina women and will fight these burdensome, unconstitutional and medically-unnecessary regulations,"" Ringer concluded.As CBS News reports, other changes suggested by DHEC include denying minors the ability to bypass parental consent for abortion through use of the judiciary; a requirement that abortionists be board certified in obstetrics and gynecology; and a mandate that abortion clinics meet higher health and safety standards.DHEC is also shelving a proposal to require - rather than offer - pap smears and tests to detect sexually transmitted diseases to women, regardless of their circumstances.The agency said it was an error to suggest a married woman living with her husband be required to obtain his consent prior to abortion. Currently, South Carolina state law requires a husband's consent in the third trimester of pregnancy, and these late-term abortions are only performed in hospitals.""As a result of comments received during the current public comment period, we realized there were two errors in the language of the existing draft revision,"" DHEC spokeswoman Jennifer Read said. ""We apologize for any confusion or concern these errors may have caused.""After a public hearing about the proposed changes, the state agency's recommendations must go before the state legislature for review.In May, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (R) signed legislation that prohibits abortion in the state past 20 weeks of pregnancy.The South Carolina Department of Health & Environmental Control (DHEC) recently proposed a series of extreme regulations for abortion providers. Many of these proposed changes are medically unnecessary, unconstitutional and clearly designed to further impede a woman's ability to make the deeply personal decision to seek safe, legal abortion.

The program screened 12 refugees in FY 2011, 31 in FY 2012, 78 in FY 2013, 66 in FY 2014, and 54 in FY 2015. The refugees came from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Afghanistan, Somalia, Ethiopia, and Jordan. The most common country of origin was Iraq. All screenings were completed withing 90 days of arrival, and most were done within 30 days.Within this period, no refugees arrived with A1, B1, or B3 tuberculosis health risk classifications. The B2 classification [latent TB] is not reportable. No refugees were diagnosed with active tuberculosis.""You've failed to include the most important information,"" Breitbart News told Washtenaw County's FOIA Coordinator. ""How many of those refugees for whom you conducted initial domestic medical screenings tested positive for latent TB infection?""Breitbart News noted that Ingham County, Michigan (Lansing) has provided latent TB infection (LTBI) data for refugees.No other county in Michigan has provided data on LTBI rates among the more than 20,000 refugees who have arrived in the state during the six years between FY 2011 and FY 2016. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services has also not provided that data on LTBI rates among arriving refugees in the state.In contrast, several other states, routinely report LTBI among arriving refugees.  Minnesota, for instance, has been reporting that data annually since 2004.LTBI rates among arriving refugees in states that report that data range from 12 percent in California to 35 percent in Vermont in recent years.LTBI rates among the general population are approximately four percent. Of those, the Centers for Disease Control estimates that five to 10 percent develop active TB at some point in their lifetime.A 2013 study by the University of California at San Diego concluded that high rates of LTBI among arriving refugees pose a risk of active TB to the general population because refugees have a higher activation rate than the general population.The significance of LTBI among refugees as a risk factor for active TB in the population as a whole is one factor that may explain the extraordinarily high levels of active TB over the past two decades in Minnesota. In 2004, for instance, 40 percent of arriving refugees, and 55 percent of those arriving from Sub-Saharan Africa tested positive for LTBI. During the five years between 2010 and 2014, the Minnesota Department of Health reported that 296 refugees were diagnosed with active TB in the state.Between 1993 and 2014, the percentage of active TB cases in Minnesota that were foreign-born increased from 50 percent to 87 percent.In Ingham County, 22 percent of arriving refugees between FY 2011 and FY 2016 tested positive for latent TB infection, 5 were diagnosed with active TB and one was diagnosed with MDR TB.""Latent TB infections aren't reportable in Michigan, and individuals may be managed through our TB control program or by their medical provider. But the individuals we managed were not tracked by their refugee or non-refugee status so we do not have this specific information to provide,"" the Washtenaw County FOIA coordinator responded.Breitbart News reminded the Washtenaw County FOIA coordinator that according to the Refugee Act of 1980, the county and the resettlement agency have a duty to monitor the treatment of refugees identified with latent TB infection, and again requested answers to three questions about latent TB infection rates among refugees arriving in Washtenaw County:1. How many refugees tested positive for latent TB infection in Washtenaw County during the period Washtenaw County Health Department conducted initial domestic medical screenings?2. How many of those initiated treatment supervised by the county?3. How many of those completed treatment supervised by the county?""As I stated in my initial response to your Freedom of Information Act request sent on 10/21/16 at 9:43 am the Act is not intended to be a question and answer session,"" the Washtenaw County FOIA Coordinator responded to Breitbart News.""Further as I stated in my follow-up response reference latent TB, we do not have this specific information to provide for the reasons stated in my email of 10/21/16 at 10:26am,"" the FOIA coordinator added.Breitbart News had requested data for six years from FY 2011 to FY 2016, but only received partial data for the five years between FY 2011 and FY 2015.""This communication is in response to your Freedom of Information Act Request subjected electronically on October 13, 2016, received October 14, 2016, pursuant to the Act a response is due today, October 21, 2016.

The Freedom of Information Act is not intended to be a question and answer session; however, for this particular request a summary of the information was prepared. This does not set precedent for future requests.According to the Department of State's interactive website, 77 refugees arrived in Washtenaw County in FY 2015. Only 70 percent of those arrivals, or 54, consented to initial domestic medical screenings, a relatively low rate compared to the 87 percent rate experienced that same year in Ingham County, Michigan.In September 2015, at the end of FY 2015, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services ended the refugee health screening contract with Washtenaw County and awarded it to St. Joseph's Hospital.During FY 2016, the number of refugees resettled in Washtenaw County increased significantly to 177, of whom 62 were from Syria.According to the FY 2017 resettlement plans for Washtenaw County from the two resettlement agencies that operate in Washtenaw County, the Lutheran Immigrant and Refugee Service (known as Samaritas in Michigan) and HIAS (formerly known as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society), a total of 400 refugees will be resettled in the county in this fiscal year, which began on October 1, more than double the number that arrived in FY 2016.Samaritas intends to bring 100 refugees into the county from Iraq and Syria.HIAS intends to bring 300 refugees into the county from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Afghanistan, Ukraine, Somalia, Eritrea, and Ethiopia.Washtenaw County Public Health's Refugee Health Screen Program completed screenings of 241 refugees between FY 2011 and FY 2015. The program screened 12 refugees in FY 2011, 31 in FY 2012, 78 in FY 2013, 66 in FY 2014, and 54 in FY 2015. The refugees came from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Afghanistan, Somalia, Ethiopia, and Jordan.

Terry McAuliffe, an influential Democrat with longstanding ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton, gave nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of the wife of an official at the Federal Bureau of Investigation who later helped oversee the investigation into Mrs. Clinton's email use.Campaign finance records show Mr. McAuliffe's political-action committee donated $467,500 to the 2015 state Senate campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe, who is married to Andrew McCabe, now the deputy director of the FBI.The Virginia Democratic Party, over which Mr. McAuliffe exerts considerable control, donated an additional $207,788 worth of support to Dr. McCabe's campaign in the form of mailers, according to the records. That adds up to slightly more than $675,000 to her candidacy from entities either directly under Mr. McAuliffe's control or strongly influenced by him. The figure represents more than a third of all the campaign funds Dr. McCabe raised in the effort.Mr. McAuliffe and other state party leaders recruited Dr. McCabe to run, according to party officials. She lost the election to incumbent Republican Dick Black....The FBI said in a statement that during his wife's campaign Mr. McCabe ""played no role, attended no events, and did not participate in fundraising or support of any kind.

The Pentagon has stressed that American troops are in harm's way as they advance towards Mosul, particularly after the recent U.S. military fatality.Army Maj. Gen. Gary J. Volesky, commander of the U.S.-led coalition's land component, and commander of the storied 101st Airborne Division, told Pentagon reporters earlier this week that the American troops fighting to liberate Mosul are only backing the Sunni component of the PMU, claiming that the Shiite PMU troops are not under the control of the Shiite-led Iraqi government.Some news reports contradict the general's claim, noting that the Shiite militias under PMU are indeed under the control of the Iraqi government.The PMU is also known as the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) and al-Hashd al-Shabi.""We don't support them,"" declared Gen. Volesky, adding, ""The Shiite PMF are not going into Mosul.""Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has vowed that only regular members of the Iraqi forces will enter Sunni-dominated Mosul, the second-largest city in Iraq and ISIS' last remaining stronghold.Nevertheless, leaders of Shiite militias - including AAH, which already threatened American forces in Iraq earlier this year and has been linked to deadly attack against the U.S. military - insist they will be part of the effort to liberate Mosul from ISIS.The Institute for the Study of War noted that a couple of days before the Mosul offensive began on October 17, Iraqi PM Abadi met with high-ranking Shiite officials, ""including Badr Organization leader Hadi al-Amiri, AAH leader Qais al-Khazali, Harakat al-Nujaba leader Akram al-Kaabi, and Kata'ib Sayyid al-Shuhada (KSAS) leader Abu Alaa to discuss Mosul and Hawija operations.""""A day later, images circulated of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force (IRGC-QF) commander Qassem Suleimani visiting an undisclosed location with Amiri and senior Popular Mobilization commander and U.S.-designated terrorist Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis,"" added ISW.Regarding whether the United States is concerned that the Shiite militias will commit sectarian killings and other atrocities against Sunnis in and around Mosul, the American defense official, echoing Gen. Volesky, indicated that ultimately what happens in Mosul is in the hands of the government of Iraq (GOI), adding that Baghdad will ""consult on Mosul governance"" with the Iraqi Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG).""Ultimately holding and governing Mosul will be an Iraqi responsibility,"" added the official.""We are working closely with the GOI to plan for security in Mosul after its liberation. The GOI understands the potential for ethno-sectarian tensions in Mosul and committed to working to mitigate those tensions,"" continued the defense official.SIGN UP""We don't support them,"" declared Gen.

Banks are threatened with lawsuits for racial discrimination based on the controversial ""disparate impact"" theory, and offered incentives to settle by paying left-wing groups directly, beyond the review or oversight of Congress.The result, the GAI report says, is a system of political patronage:The old time political machine has been replaced by these nonprofits and a system of patronage now operates with the imprimatur of the DOJ. The DOJ has instituted a system that provides significant funding for nonprofit ""community organizers"" through a pattern of extortive lawsuits. This system, wherein appointed attorneys can legally extract money from the private sector and redistribute the funds to third-party organizations outside of the appropriations process, shows an unprecedented and extraordinary disregard for Congressional authority.Left-wing groups have long used the Community Reinvestment Act -- signed by President Jimmy Carter in 1977 and boosted by President Bill Clinton in the 1990s -- to threaten bank mergers unless the banks fund their lending and activist operations.Many of the organizations, including the non-profit Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America (NACA), control huge amounts of funding for use in mortgages that might not otherwise be granted. They also register their beneficiaries to vote.A former NACA employee, who spoke to Breitbart News on condition of anonymity, confirmed that ""They do ask that everyone is registered to vote. They don't force you to do it, but when you come in for your intake, and you do your initial application [for a mortgage], you are handed a voter registration form."" Applicants were also asked to perform various acts of ""community service"" for NACA, which typically involved political activity, such as attending protests or writing to Congress.In early 2009, in the midst of a wave of foreclosures as a result of the 2007-8 subprime mortgage crisis, groups like NACA used old-style intimidation tactics to ""terrorize"" bankers personally, including by targeting bankers' children at their schools.According to the GAI report, the Obama administration's new policy, midway through 2009, abused the powers of the Justice Department to do through the courts what groups like NACA had once done through the bare-knuckle tactics of the streets.The former NACA employee told Breitbart News that the group's ideology is ""not capitalist.""""They have a sort of socialistic worldview ... They don't like capitalism. They don't like landlords."" Clients were prevented in NACA's mortgage agreements from renting out their homes.
