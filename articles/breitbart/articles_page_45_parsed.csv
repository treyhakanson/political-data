It's just been announced that Americans are going to experience another massive double-digit hike in Obamacare -- you see that? -- including premiums like, in the great state of Arizona, where they're going to go up at 116%.""Don't worry, you'll be there very soon -- unless I win, in which case you not going to have to worry about it,"" he said, as the crowd roared its approval.""Repealing Obamacare is one of the single most important reasons we must win on November 8,"" he added, to more cheers.He also promised to win the Buckeye State, drawing applause by citing Wednesday's new poll from Remington Research Group, showing Trump leading Hillary Clinton 46% to 42% in a four-way race, outside the the 2.2% margin of error.Before Trump spoke, several local politicians addressed the event, including Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), a prominent conservative and a member of the House Select Committee on Benghazi.In a plain-spoken presentation, Jordan slammed Obamacare, and argued that Clinton had disqualified herself from the presidency through her failures in Benghazi and her lies that follows.""Anyone who won't square with parents whose children gave their lives to this great nation should not be commander-in-chief,"" Jordan said, to roars of approval.There were fans of all ages in the crowd. Three generations of the Vanatta family came from nearby Englewood to see Trump speak -- including 10-month-old baby Morgan, dressed in a homemade ""Make America Great Again"" onesie.They had been to see Mitt Romney four years before, in Dayton; they had also rallied for John McCain in 2008. But there was not as much excitement then as there is for Trump now, they said, recounting that they had sat in traffic for an hour just to reach the highway exit.Mike Robinson of nearby Hamilton brought a homemade ""Drain The Swamp"" sign -- a slogan that has been appearing frequently on do-it-yourself posters at recent Trump rallies.He predicted that Trump would win Ohio and the presidency. ""They talk about an 'October surprise' -- they're going to get a 'November surprise',"" he said.Not everyone in the audience was a Trump supporter. One African-American teenager, Dantre Jackson of Springfield, told Breitbart News that he is supporting Hillary Clinton. ""Donald Trump could get it done, but he's only helping people who have businesses. Hillary is trying to help everybody,"" he said.Another, Anthony Embry, also of Springfield, said he is not voting for either candidate. ""Hillary's all about the women thing, but then we know what happened with her husband,"" he said. ""And Trump is too crazy for me. I can't see how he can run the country. His rallies are violent, he's bringing hatred to America.""Trump also reiterated many familiar themes from earlier stump speeches, including his attacks on the North American Free Trade Agreement, his criticism of the Clintons' corruption, and his pledge to build a wall along the border with Mexico.He had a message for Mexico's drug cartels, he said: when he is elected, ""your long reign of crime, and terror, and horror, will come to a very beautiful, and crashing, end.""On the other side of the venue, one protester was removed by local law enforcement.Joel B.

For example, Obama's gun control push has been coupled with an admission that ""the Second Amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms."" Whether Obama's belief in an individual right is heartfelt is another question altogether, but at least he said he believes in a constitutionally protected individual right. On June 5, Clinton twice refused to affirm whether a constitutionally protected individual right exists. Therefore, Chapman observes, ""When it comes to gun rights, Clinton has taken a position appreciably to the left of Barack Obama's.""But the problem is not simply her June 5 refusal to admit the constitutionality of the right to keep and bear arms; it is also the clear contradiction that emerged during the last presidential debate, wherein she maintained her opposition to the District of Columbia v Heller (2008) ruling while simultaneously attempting to espouse her new conviction that ""there's an individual right to bear arms.""Thus, she opposes the Heller decision, which reaffirmed the existence of an individual right to keep and bear arms, yet says she believes ""there's an individual right to bear arms."" Chapman covered the contradiction this way:So Clinton rejects the Supreme Court decision that established constitutional protection for that right -- but now agrees the right has constitutional protection? As former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan once said, ""If I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said.""Chapman continued:She and Obama both favor universal background checks for gun purchases, a ban on ""assault weapons"" and denial of guns to anyone on the federal no-fly list. But her cramped view of the Second Amendment suggests she would favor additional curbs that she knows the Supreme Court would not abide.Her solution to this impasse with the Supreme Court? Change the makeup of the court with ""a new justice or two."" At the same time, she wants to strike back at the protections of the First Amendment handed down by the court in Citizens United (2010). ""She proposes a constitutional amendment to overturn the decision -- which would be the first time in our history that the Bill of Rights would be altered to restrict our freedoms.""AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of ""Bullets with AWR Hawkins,"" a Breitbart News podcast.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFrom the Wall Street Journal:Two chief fundraisers for the Clinton Foundation pressed corporate donors to steer business opportunities to former President Bill Clinton as well, according to a hacked memo published Wednesday by WikiLeaks.The November 2011 memo from Douglas Band, at the time a top aide to Mr. Clinton, outlines extensive fundraising efforts that Mr. Band and a partner deployed on behalf of the Clinton Foundation and how that work sometimes translated into large speaking fees and other paid work for Mr. Clinton.The memo, part of a cache of emails stolen from Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, resurfaces an issue that she has had a hard time shaking: questions over the relationship between the Clintons' charity work and their personal business.Mr. Band and an associate introduced top corporate executives to the former president, on the golf course and elsewhere, and then asked them to contribute money to the Clinton Foundation or attend the Clinton Global Initiative, an annual foundation event.Mr. Band wrote the memo to lawyers at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP who were reviewing the Clinton Foundation's activities and links to Mr. Band. The Clintons' daughter, Chelsea, had sought the review because she worried that Mr. Band was ""hustling business"" for his consulting firm, Teneo Holdings, at the Clinton Global Initiative, according to a 2011 email by Ms. Clinton.In the memo, Mr. Band explained how he helped the foundation and former president, and found donors among his own firm's clients. Mr. Band responded to the review by writing: ""We appreciate the unorthodox nature of our roles, and the goal of seeking ways to ensure we are implementing best practices to protect the 501(c)3 status of the Foundation.""Read the rest here.

Health insurance premiums will jump an average of 22 percent in 2017, and federal spending to assist moderate income families is spinning out of control.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFor Democrats, the answers are simple--raise taxes on the wealthy to further subsidize a failing system--or force a single payer system--which can dictate prices to service providers and compel their participation--onto reluctant Americans.For conservative Republicans, the issue is more vexing. Merely repealing the law is not enough, because that would hardly return America to a free market.Even before the Affordable Care Act, federal and state governments were paying nearly half of the nation's health care bills.At one extreme, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates for doctors are tightly controlled and too low to sustain their practices. Many limit the number of patients they take from these programs, and the elderly and poor often face difficulty finding a primary care physician.Well-off retirees can join concierge services, which charge high annual fees for access to primary care doctors, while the less affluent are left to scramble.At the other extreme, the legislation establishing Medicare prescription coverage does not permit the government to negotiate prices. Pharmaceutical companies can set whatever prices they like knowing the elderly will simply send the bill to Uncle Sam.Concierge services have generalized from the elderly to the entire adult care marketplace and created a two-tier system of access to physicians, while Medicare reimbursements are setting drug prices arbitrarily high for everyone.The basic premise of the ACA was to enroll nearly every working age American in large employer-sponsored insurance or policies sold on government run websites to create competition that would lower costs, but it has not worked out.At HealthCare.gov, families often pay $500, $1000 or more a month for policies imposing high deductibles and co-pays and with quite limited provider networks. Many have lost access to family doctors, encountered limited out-of-state-coverage when they travel and are generally excluded from using higher cost providers where they live.The latter can be life threatening. As of the end of 2015, for example, none of the policies offered access to New York included the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.Problems are particularly acute in areas where the number of specialists are limited, and hospitals and group practices are monopolized enough to resist negotiating much on price with insurance companies.Insurance companies are taking big losses, resulting in the large premium increases noted above--or leaving the website markets across the country. At least 650 of counties nationwide will have only one company offering policies next year.Many folks won't feel the full brunt of rate increases, as the federal government is obligated to subsidize premiums for low and middle income families, but the Congressional Budget Office estimates the ACA will cost $8.9 trillion over ten years.We simply cannot go back to what existed before. Private plans lost in the upheaval cannot be easily reestablished. Simple electoral calculus requires that millions of Americans now receiving subsidies continue to receive assistance purchasing health insurance. However, Americans should not be coerced into buying substandard policies at a government store, and costs must be lowered.The German system of private insurance, like Obamacare, requires virtually everyone to have coverage, but costs are more tightly controlled. For example, regulators price new drugs according to how much they improve treatment over existing medicines.Such government interference in pricing is an anathema to conservative Republicans like Paul Ryan, but the incongruity of Medicare paying whatever prices drug companies choose to set is wholly unrealistic.Japan, Germany and other northern European countries spend about 11 percent of GDP on health care whereas the United States spends 17 percent.In the end, if the Republicans want to avoid a single payer system that subjects most Americans to a choice between moribund and arbitrary service akin to that offered by the Post Office and IRS, then they will have to explore with the new president regulating prices inside a private marketplace.Effective leaders work with the world as they find it, not as they think it should be.Peter Morici is an economist and business professor at the University of Maryland, and a national columnist.

Trump has been saying all week that the media are using discouraging polls to ""suppress"" -- i.e. discourage -- his voters.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERNow Clinton supporters are citing an unnamed Trump official who actually used the word ""suppression"" to describe the effect of negative news stories circulated on social media and aimed at ""idealistic white liberals, young women, and African Americans"" who might otherwise vote for the Democratic nominee.The truth is that the term ""suppression"" is not necessarily nefarious. Here is a report on the New Hampshire primary, about how bad weather could ""suppress"" Trump's voters:Bush is hoping that history will say he took on the forces of populism honestly and angrily and won. If the terrible weather in New Hampshire suppresses the Trump vote then the media spin might be that we've seen the real ceiling of The Donald's support. Don't be surprised if Trump wins but polls below 30 per cent.Other kinds of ""suppression"" are less benign. Both campaigns run active voter suppression campaigns. Clinton allies telling Jewish voters that Trump is Hitler, for example, is classic suppression (and there is evidence that it is working).There is also ""reverse suppression."" Telling black voters that voter ID is an attempt to suppress them, for example, is a tactic that President Barack Obama and other Democrats have used to encourage black voters to go to the polls (even though polls suggest most black voters actually approve of voter ID laws).And then there is the opposite tactic, which is to scare voters into heading to the polls by telling them that they will face some kind of sanction if they do not vote. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) was unapologetic about mailers his campaigns used in Iowa that reminded voters their participation in primaries was a matter of public record. Democrats sent a similar mailer in 2014.The latest hubbub fits both categories. A Trump official tells a journalist about voter suppression plans; the Clinton-friendly media pretends it is more nefarious than it is.Welcome to kitchen-sink season.Joel B.

Nathan Deal to block a state legal demand that a Christian lay pastor hand over his sermons, sermon notes, and even his Bible.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe man has already been fired from his position as a state district health director, allegedly because he preached about Christian principles in his sermons.Last month, Georgia's Attorney General Sam Olens issued a request for production of documents -- similar to a subpoena -- which demands that Dr. Eric Walsh turn over all sermon notes and sermon transcripts for review by the state.Walsh, however, is refusing to hand over transcripts of sermons he has given in which he preaches about Christian life, including the topics of marriage, sexuality, and creation. An African American public health professional, Walsh has two doctoral degrees and was hired by the Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) in May of 2014 after serving on President Barack Obama's Advisory Council on HIV/AIDs. He is also associate pastor of his Seventh Day Adventist church.""The State of Georgia's brazen discrimination against an individual on the basis of his religious beliefs violates everything we believe in as a nation,"" said Jane Robbins, a senior fellow at American Principles Project, in a statement.

Anything else will suggest that people of faith need not apply for government jobs in Georgia.In April, Walsh was fired from DPH allegedly because Georgia officials did not agree with his sermons.""I couldn't believe they fired me because of things I talked about in my sermons,"" said Walsh. ""It was devastating. I have been unable to get a job in public health since then.""Walsh's attorneys at First Liberty Institute filed a federal lawsuit in U.S. District Court, in which they alleged that the state violated their client's rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, as well as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The lawsuit seeks financial compensation for Walsh and a federal court order forcing Georgia to halt discrimination against Americans of faith on the basis of their religious beliefs.""The state insists that it did not fire Dr. Walsh over his religious beliefs or sermons. If that's true, why is it demanding copies of his sermons now?"" said Jeremy Dys, senior Counsel for First Liberty Institute, in a statement. ""It's clear the government fired Dr. Walsh over his religious beliefs, which is blatant religious discrimination.""Family Research Council (FRC) expressed its outrage at the state of Georgia, and launched a petition at FRC.org/Walsh that calls on Deal to ""correct this egregious overreach of the state into church affairs.""""This demand for Dr. Eric Walsh's sermons, sermons notes, and ministerial documentation is an alarming display of government intrusion into the sanctity of the church, pastor's study, and pulpit,"" said Tony Perkins, Family Research Council President and also an ordained pastor. ""This is something that I would have expected to see in a communist country, not America.""Perkins added:The pulpit is to be governed only by the Word of God. Government scrutiny of speech in the pulpit is unconstitutional, and unconscionable. Family Research Council stands with Dr. Walsh, and any other pastor who is targeted by the government because of what is said in the pulpit. We call on Gov. Deal to correct this egregious overreach of the state into church affairs.Travis Weber, FRC's director of Center for Religious Liberty, also said:We've recently seen the former Mayor of Houston issue subpoenas against pastors in Houston, Texas, seeking their sermons. This action against Dr. Walsh is another unjust assault on people of faith, including the pulpit itself. This cannot go unchallenged. We support Dr. Walsh in his resistance, and call upon the Georgia government to act according to the law and traditions of our country, which respect people of faith and the autonomy of the church.Similarly, Penny Nance, president of Concerned Women for America, said, ""The state of Georgia's blatant attack on religious freedom, as they discriminate against another pastor, Dr. Eric Walsh, is indeed a threat to every American, whatever our religious beliefs.""Nance added that the state of Georgia's actions are ""part of a troubling pattern that is very dangerous.""""Can there be a clearer violation of our First Amendment right to religious freedom than for the state to monitor, examine, and retaliate against a person because of the sermons they share?"" she asked.But in attempting to defend an indefensible decision, the State is now requiring a Christian minister to surrender his sermon notes for inspection under the threat of law.

I wouldn't put it past him to use the team's stay to his advantage. This is why I don't think they should stay there.""The Ireland-All Blacks game kicks off three days before the presidential election in front of an expected sell-out crowd of U.S. and visiting rugby fans.For its part, the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) sees no problem with the choice of accommodation. It says it is simply a matter of accepting what is available and will not be backing down.In a statement, the IRFU said the hotel was chosen at the start of this year, months before Donald Trump became the official Republican candidate.Chicago also hosts a large packaging expo during the same weekend as the Ireland-New Zealand match so the Irish team saw few options, they say.""The accommodation requirements of the team are purely based on the facilities that are available and if they match the requirements, that's simply it.""Although rugby is still a long way from the sports mainstream in the U.S., the All Blacks still attract plenty of attention on their own.

 Politics aside, the game promises to be a tough one for the Irish. Coach Joe Schmidt has selected six uncapped players on his roster to take on a rampant New Zealand All Black team that remains unbeaten in its last 18 outings against tier-one opponents.History is also on the side of the Kiwis.The two teams first met in 1905, with New Zealand winning 15-0 at Lansdowne Road, Dublin. A total of 28 Test matches have been contested, with the All Blacks winning 27 of them. The remaining match resulted in a draw.

In those states,  the federal government has selected a voluntary agency to resettle refugees under the statutorily questionable Wilson Fish alternative program. In Nevada, the federal government selected CCSN.The Refugee Act of 1980 requires CCSN to conduct initial domestic medical screenings of arriving refugees, test them for active TB and latent TB infection (LTBI), report that data to the local county health department, and monitor their subsequent treatment for both conditions when diagnosed.CCSN has not responded to several requests for this refugee health data from Breitbart News.In 2015, Nevada reported 85 cases of active TB, according to the CDC, a 14.9 percent increase from the 74 cases reported in 2014.In 2015, the percentage of foreign-born cases of active TB in Nevada increased to 70.6 percent, or 60 out of 85, according to Nevada 2015 TB Fast Facts, published by the Tuberculosis Prevention and Control Program of the Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health. Sixty-seven percent of Nevada's active TB cases in 2014, or 50 out of 74, were foreign-born.The 60 cases of active TB diagnosed among foreign-born residents of Nevada in 2015 broke down as follows, by country of origin: Philippines (20), Mexico (13), Ethiopia (5), China (5), Vietnam (4), India (5), Other/Unknown (8).The 13 cases of active TB diagnosed in 2015 in Nevada residents whose country of origin were either Ethiopa or ""Other/Unknown"" likely arrived in the United States under the federal refugee resettlement program, but Catholic Charities of Southern Nevada, which has this data, has not responded to any of multiple requests for comment on this issue from Breitbart News.As Breitbart News reported previously, the number of refugees resettled in Nevada has increased every year since FY 2011.A number of the 3,339 refugees who resettled  in Nevada between FY 2011 and FY 2017-to-date arrived from high TB burden countries, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (530), Somalia (333) Eritrea (332), Burma (226), Bhutan (12), and Ethiopia (84).During the entire five year period between FY 2011 and FY 2015, 430 cases of active TB were diagnosed in Nevada.  146 were U.S.-born, and 284 were foreign-born. Of the 284 foreign-born cases, 20 cases were diagnosed among Nevada residents who were born in Ethiopia, and 58 cases  were diagnosed among Nevada residents who were born in ""Other/Another"" country.The majority of these 58 foreign-born cases of active TB of Nevada residents born in Ethiopia or ""Other/Another"" country likely arrived in the United States under the federal refugee resettlement program.When and if Catholic Charities of Southern Nevada confirms or denies this data, the number of refugees diagnosed with active TB in Nevada will be added to the 304 known cases of active TB diagnosed among refugees in fifteen states over the past six years.Foreign-born cases of TB in Nevada have been a higher percentage of all cases diagnosed in the state than the national average in each of  the past five years. The national percentage of foreign-born TB cases has gone from 62 percent in 2011 to 66 percent in 2015, while the Nevada percentage of foreign-born TB cases has gone from 74 percent in 2011 to 76 percent in 2012 to 70 percent in 2015.(Sources: Centers for Disease Control, Nevada 2015 TB Fast Facts)In 2012 the Nevada Policy Research Institute reported that CCSN has contracted with Southern Nevada Health District (SNHD), which is the county health department for Clark County (Las Vegas), to perform the initial medical screenings for the refugees they bring to Nevada. According to the report, SNHD  did not conform to federal standards in its conduct of those initial medical screenings:ORR [Office of Refugee Resettlement] guidelines state that the refugee medical ""screenings should be performed by a qualified licensed health care professional."" And by such a professional, ORR means -- as demonstrated through ORR's use of federal billing codes -- either a physician, a physician's assistant, or a nurse practitioner.SNHD's contracts with Catholic Charities, however, only state that the district will have ""a Community Health Nurse"" do ""a complete history and physical"" on refugees.All of the district's community health nurses are registered nurses (RNs), according to the Nevada State Board of Nursing, and none are nurse practitioners (NPs), also called, in Nevada, advanced nursing practitioners (ANPs).The health district's use of RNs for such work would also appear to violate the Nevada Administrative Code's regulations governing nurse practice.""Well, it's always been our understanding that we are in compliance with any medical screening guidelines, in terms of having community nurses conduct the screenings,"" Carisa Lopez Ramirez, CCSN's vice president for immigration and migration services, told the Nevada Journal at the time.""It is our understanding that what [the RNs] are performing, is basically asking questions related to medical history. But in terms of the actual physical examination, [the RN] is being monitored by a medical director that oversees that whole program,"" Ramirez added.Breitbart News contacted SNHD to obtain refugee health data on LTBI rates and active TB cases discovered in the domestic medical screenings it conducts of refugees.""The Southern Nevada Health District can only provide limited information regarding your request as we do not have all the data you are seeking regarding refugee health assessments; we do not see all refugees who come to the Las Vegas Valley. It is recommended that you contact Catholic Charities for information about refugees and asylum seekers. In addition, the Southern Nevada Health District would not have information related to the State of Nevada as a whole. It is recommended that you contact the state's Division of Public and Behavioral Health for statewide information. The Health District also would not have information specifically related to parolees,"" a spokesperson tells Breitbart News.A spokesperson for SNHD provided refugee latent TB infection rate information ""based on clients seen at the Southern Nevada Health District. """"Domestic medical screenings can be provided by the Southern Nevada Health District as well as other healthcare providers in the community,"" the spokesperson said.Of 3,184 refugee clients ""seen at the Southern Nevada Health District"" between 2011 and August 2016, 547, or 17.3 percent, tested positive for LTBI.That rate was higher for the eight month period between January and August 2016: 108 out of 436 refugees, or 24.6 percent, tested positive for LTBI.Significantly, SNHD does not track treatment rates for refugees who test positive for LTBI.""The Southern Nevada Health District does not have information related to the number of LTBI refugees who have completed treatment as well as those with active disease. The State of Nevada reports TB cases as 'foreign born' which includes refugees, as well as US citizens. You will need to contact the State of Nevada for additional information,"" a spokesperson tells Breitbart News.Under the Refugee Act of 1980, CCSN has the responsibility to monitor the treatment of refugees who test positive for LTBI.Whether the organization is treating refugees who test positive for LTBI was one of several questions Breitbart posed repeatedly to CCSN to  which it received no response. The other significant question that CCSN has yet to answer is how many of the refugees it has helped resettle in Nevada have been diagnosed with active TB.The federal Office of Refugee Resettlement website lists Carisa Lopez Ramirez of CCSN as both the State Refugee Coordinator and State Health Coordinator. Ms. Ramirez's voice mail at CCSN indicates she is Vice President of Immigration Services there.The Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health  (NDPBH) was able to provide very little of the refugee health data requested by Breitbart News.A spokesperson for the Tuberculosis Prevention and Control Program of Nevada's Office of Public Health Informatics and Epidemiology, which is part of NDPBH, told Breitbart News in an emailed statement:Unfortunately, the TB Program for the State of Nevada only collects information for active TB cases for the time period you are requesting-we do not collect data on LTBI cases for any case before 2016.I tried to pull a report on the Domestic Screening information out of a different CDC database the State has access to, but I do not have access to those reports as well as I am not able to differentiate between immigrant and refugee (the two populations are combined together). Also, I was not able to look up the records one-by-one as I originally thought we could do, as several cases each year had incomplete information. (For example, some cases did not have the completion data or the treatment start date etc.) So I will not be able to attempt to answer the domestic screening questions you have listed as it would be very incomplete.You will need to contact Catholic Charities of Southern Nevada regarding all of the domestic screening questions . . . I am not sure who the domestic screening program/medical provider was for this five year period. You will want to contact Carisa Lopez-Ramirez at Catholic Charities for most of your questions. If she does not have the data available, perhaps you can get it from the domestic screening program/medical provider directly.The spokesperson added that "" [the] [t]otal number of B1, B2, B3 TB notifications received by Nevada (for both refugees and immigrants) from 2011-2015 was 2,216. (Total number of refugees who arrived with a B1, B2 or B3 TB notification 105 during 2011-2015).""Breitbart News will continue to question CCSN until it receives answers to the important refugee health data questions it has posed repeatedly, without response so far. ORR [Office of Refugee Resettlement] guidelines state that the refugee medical ""screenings should be performed by a qualified licensed health care professional."" And by such a professional, ORR means -- as demonstrated through ORR's use of federal billing codes -- either a physician, a physician's assistant, or a nurse practitioner.
SNHD's contracts with Catholic Charities, however, only state that the district will have ""a Community Health Nurse"" do ""a complete history and physical"" on refugees.
All of the district's community health nurses are registered nurses (RNs), according to the Nevada State Board of Nursing, and none are nurse practitioners (NPs), also called, in Nevada, advanced nursing practitioners (ANPs).
The health district's use of RNs for such work would also appear to violate the Nevada Administrative Code's regulations governing nurse practice.Unfortunately, the TB Program for the State of Nevada only collects information for active TB cases for the time period you are requesting-we do not collect data on LTBI cases for any case before 2016.
I tried to pull a report on the Domestic Screening information out of a different CDC database the State has access to, but I do not have access to those reports as well as I am not able to differentiate between immigrant and refugee (the two populations are combined together).

Nevada has six electoral votes, and also features a close U.S. Senate race this year.""In Las Vegas terms, the contest for Nevada's six electoral votes is a 'push' right now,"" Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, told NBC.The same NBC/WSJ/Marist poll also shows that Clinton leads 60 percent to 35 percent, among early Nevada voters, 13 percent of whom have already voted.However, among the 87 percent who say they haven't yet voted, Trump is reportedly ahead by four points with 46 percent to 42 percent.Clinton was ahead by one point in this two-way matchup, with 45 percent to 44 percent just one month ago. And just one week ago, a KTNV-TV 13/Rasmussen poll showed Clinton was leading Trump in Nevada by four points.A second NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll shows that in New Hampshire, Clinton has a nine-point lead over Trump with 45 percent of likely voters compared to 36 percent for Trump; Libertarian Gary Johnson is reportedly at 10 percent and the Green Party's Jill Stein is at 4 percent.""Odds are that Clinton can bank on New Hampshire's four electoral votes,"" Miringoff told NBC.NBC suggests that even if Clinton loses Florida, Nevada, North Carolina and Ohio, she can ""still win the presidency by holding on to New Hampshire and Pennsylvania,"" which total 10 electoral votes.The latest Fox News poll, released on Wednesday, also indicates Clinton's lead over Trump has shrunk to a 3-point lead with less than two weeks away from the November 8 election.That same poll found Independents favoring Trump over Clinton by 13 points (41-28 percent). It also found that Clinton has a commanding lead among unmarried women (+27) and first time voters (+16). Trump was found to lead among men (+5) and evangelical Christians (+56).Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope @AdelleNazSIGN UP@AdelleNaz"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

In a 2008 interview he explained, ""If somebody wants to build a coal-powered plant, they can. It's just that it will bankrupt them.""True to his word, the president implemented a number of regulations and executive actions that have led to a continuing decline in coal employment since 2011. Not only did the president announce a moratorium on federal coal leases, but his ""Stream Protection Rule"" was written so broadly as to potentially eliminate half of existing U.S. coal mines. And on top of that comes a ""Clean Power Plan"" designed to eliminate 40 percent of America's remaining coal fleet.With the plight of coal communities suddenly factoring in a tight election, however, the Obama Administration made a curious announcement: it will ring up ""nearly $28 million in investments to grow the economy in the nation's coal-impacted communities."" The new package is intended to complement a previous $38.8 million package for coal communities announced in August.According to Earl F. Gohl, federal Co-Chair of the Appalachian Regional Commission, such investments would ""enable Appalachia's coal-impacted communities to continue their work developing innovative paths towards economic resilience."" Gohl optimistically calls Appalachia ""America's next great investment opportunity.""The Obama Administration grant includes measures to: study the feasibility of converting coal to carbon fiber composites; boost tourism in southwest Virginia; train skilled workers for jobs in the drone industry; and, provide training and technical assistance for cybersecurity careers.What these curious initiatives overlook is that America's coal communities are not looking for a handout. What they appreciate is that coal has supplied robust, affordable power for generations. And while coal is 90 percent cleaner than it was 30 years ago, advanced technologies now promise to make coal even cleaner and safer.Thus, it seems logical that, if President Obama wanted to help coal communities directly, while also boosting America's technological prowess on the world stage, he could best spend taxpayer money on investments to improve the safety and efficiency of coal-fired power. Doing so would save coal country jobs while also boosting America's high-tech research and production.Unfortunately, the president is pasting a quick bandage on a bad wound. Maybe it will help his candidate of choice in time for the November 8 election. But it offers little in terms of long-term economic security for America's coal states.SIGN UP"	['Clinton', 'Obama']	[]

Buchanan Blasts Pentagon; DoD Suspends Bonus Clawback	"A senior Florida Republican congressman and Air National Guard veteran tells Breitbart News the Pentagon's decision to suspend its campaign of reclaiming enlistment bonuses from California National Guardsmen is not a sufficient response to the scandal.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""I know how important these enlistment bonuses can be for soldiers and their families,"" said Rep. Vern Buchanan (R.-Fla.), who served six years in the Air National Guard.""Many of our veterans serving in Iraq and Afghanistan endured long separations from their families and economic hardship while fighting abroad,"" he said.Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter order the collection of erroneous bonus, but Wednesday he announced that he was suspending the program for further review.""I have ordered the Defense Finance and Accounting Service to suspend all efforts to collect reimbursement from affected California National Guard members, effective as soon as is practical. This suspension will continue until I am satisfied that our process is working effectively,"" Cater said.""Ultimately, we will provide for a process that puts as little burden as possible on any soldier who received an improper payment through no fault of his or her own. At the same time, it will respect our important obligation to the taxpayer,"" he said.""I want to be clear: this process has dragged on too long, for too many service members. Too many cases have languished without action,"" the secretary said.""Not good enough,"" Buchanan told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview.""There is no middle ground on this issue. The Pentagon needs to tell veterans it will permanently -- not temporarily -- end its obscene effort to collect enlistment bonuses from a decade ago,"" he said.""The government also should apologize to all the veterans affected.""The issue has become a national scandal and was the first topic of Curt Schilling on his first episode of his Breitbart Radio talk show ""Whatever It Takes.""Schilling said 10,000 soldiers were given bonuses up to $50,000 that were given by mistake, so the government is looking to take them back-with interest.""What is our government doing?"" he asked.This ""horrific action"" is another example of the government's inept and embarrassing job performance and disconnect from what normal Americans expect, the pitcher said.Buchanan, who is the vice-chair of the bipartisan Florida House delegation, said to be told they have to repay thousands of dollars in enlistment bonuses because of a bureaucratic snafu is disgraceful and unacceptable.The congressman wrote to Carter Wednesday to demand answers about the bonus scandal and to request that the Pentagon review the impact of the problem on the soldiers and airmen of the Sunshine State's National Guard:While the California National Guard has been the subject of investigations, we need accurate information to ensure that service members from other states - particularly Florida - have not been subject to this outrageous abuse. The Florida National Guard is one of the largest state Guard organizations in the country with more than 11,600 soldiers and airmen.To that end, I respectfully request that your office (1) identify any instances of Florida service members who are or have been subject to bonus recoupment proceedings due to the mistakes of Defense Department officials and (2) describe steps that the Defense Department is taking to rectify this situation, both nationally and with respect to Florida.Buchanan said he will continue to pursue answers.""For many soldiers, this money means the difference between paying the mortgage, owning a car and putting food on the table,"" he said.""The Pentagon wastes billions of dollars on defective weapons systems but it can't help our veterans?""While the California National Guard has been the subject of investigations, we need accurate information to ensure that service members from other states - particularly Florida - have not been subject to this outrageous abuse.
