Tim Kaine (D-VA) lost badly to Indiana Gov. Mike Pence in Tuesday night's vice presidential debate -- despite having home field advantage in Farmville, Virginia -- raising new doubts about Hillary Clinton.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThose doubts are twofold: first, about her decision to choose so weak a candidate, who seemed unable to answer basic policy questions; and second, about Clinton's health, since if her medical troubles are as bad as feared, Kaine may be taking over at some point if she is elected.Kaine could not stop interrupting Pence, at times sounding high-pitched and shrill, at times whining and defensive. Pence was cool and even-tempered -- presidential, in other words, while Kaine seemed to be playing cable news pundit.The Democrat was often unable to suppress the juvenile impulse to shout campaign talking points, even in the middle of his opponent's answers. At one point, he interjected: ""Our plan is like Ronald Reagan's plan from 1986."" (Note to Democrats: the Reagan plan failed.)Later, when the moderator asked why Putin would respect a Trump-Pence administration, Pence answered: ""Strength."" Kaine, unable to restrain himself, blurted out: ""Business deals."" His smirk betrayed his conviction that he had just scored points, even though the moderator had to instruct him -- for the third time, at least -- to wait until it was his turn to speak.Kaine seemed not to understand how un-serious he looked. Pence responded with a steady, and appropriate, put-down: ""That's nonsense.""Pence also beat Kaine over the head with the Russian ""reset,"" Clinton's email scandal, and the Clinton Foundation. Moderator Elaine Quijano of CBS News stepped in to protect Kaine, especially when it came to the email scandal (though, to her credit, she at least asked about it, unlike NBC News' Lester Holt in the first presidential debate).There was nothing in Tim Kaine's performance that showed he could act like a president. Pence aced that test.Now the hard questions for Hillary will begin.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Here is Trump's exact quote, as reported by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency:Jewish Telegraphic AgencyAt a news conference in Washington, D.C., on Monday, the Republican presidential front-runner was asked whether he believed the Israeli government should pay for American defense, as he had called for other U.S. allies, such as South Korea, Japan and Saudi Arabia, to do.""I think Israel will do that also, yeah, I think Israel do -- there are many countries that can pay and they can pay big league,"" Trump responded.""Later that day, Trump gave a well-received speech at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) annual policy conference."

Two years later, Giffords and her husband began pushing to require all would-be gun owners to pass the same check Giffords's attacker passed.Kaine released a statement on the gun control art exhibit:We have a decision to make about what matters to us...

At the same time, I would like to think that there may be some work to be done to protect our service members overseas from any kind of legal ensnarement that occur, any kind of retribution.Before the bill became the law of the land last Wednesday over Obama's veto, the Pentagon warned it could be devastating to the U.S. military, opening it up to retaliatory litigation in foreign courts that could place American troops in legal jeopardy.Moreover, the law could ""put the United States in the difficult position of choosing between disclosing classified or otherwise sensitive information or suffering adverse rulings and potentially large damage awards for our refusal to do so,"" warned Carter in a letter to Congress before Obama's veto was overturned.Last Thursday, the day after the bill became law, congressional leaders from both parties expressed reservations about the negative impact the bill may have, such as opening the United States to being sued for actions it has taken overseas.Congressional leaders from both parties have said they are open to making changes to the law to fix any negative effects the law may have.In the letter to Congress, Carter warned that the 9/11 bill could harm ""important counterterrorism efforts abroad,"" reports the Associated Press (AP).Carter also said it ""could lead to the public disclosure of American secrets and even undercut counterterrorism efforts by sowing mistrust among U.S. partners and allies.""President Obama warned that ""foreign governments would be able to act 'reciprocally' and allow their courts to exercise jurisdiction over the United States and its employees for allegedly causing injuries overseas through American support to third parties,"" notes AP.The new law is already being employed.Citing the new law days after it was enacted, Stephanie Ross DeSimone, the widow of a man who was killed in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks filed a lawsuit against U.S. ally Saudi Arabia.In a complaint filed Friday at a U.S. court in Washington, she argues that the kingdom provided material support to al-Qaeda and its leader, Osama bin Laden, who was killed by the U.S. military in Pakistan in May 2011.Of the 19 al-Qaeda plane hijackers who carried out the September 11, 2001, attacks, 15 were Saudi nationals.While many states have criticized JASTA for its potential of eroding the principle of sovereign immunity and changing international law, the lobbyist group Arab Project in Iraq sees their opportunity to ask for compensation from the United States over violations by the US forces following US invasion that saw the toppling of late President Saddam Hussein in 2003.
Citing how the Congress has given US civilians the opportunity to get compensation from ""individuals"" and ""foreign nations"" over their terrorist act in the United States, the group said Iraqis deserved the same treatment.We want to make sure the 9/11 victims and their families have their day in court.

Pollak4 Oct 2016Fact check: TRUE.Not only did foreign governments and foreign donors give to the Clinton's family charity, but the majority of people outside of the government who met with Clinton while she was in office were Clinton Foundation donors, according to the Associated Press.The ultimate proof of Pence's claim? The Clinton Foundation has grudgingly said that it would no longer accept foreign contributions if she became president.by John Hayward4 Oct 2016In fact, former President Clinton's exact words on Monday were as follows:So you've got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care and then the people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. It's the craziest thing in the world.CNN reports Clinton realized his mistake and tried to walk his comments back the following day:Look, the Affordable Health Care Act did a world of good, and the 50-something efforts to repeal it that the Republicans have staged were a terrible mistake. We, for the first time in our history, at least are providing insurance to more than 90% of our people. But there is a group of people -- mostly small business owners and employees -- who make just a little too much money to qualify for Medicaid expansion or for the tax incentives who can't get affordable health insurance premiums in a lot of places. And the reason is they're not in big pools, so they have no bargaining power.by Katie McHugh4 Oct 2016In his June 16, 2015 speech announcing his run for the presidency, Donald Trump said the following: When do we beat Mexico at the border? They're laughing at us, at our stupidity. And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. But they're killing us economically.The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems.Thank you. It's true, and these are the best and the finest. When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we're getting. And it only makes common sense. It only makes common sense. They're sending us not the right people.It's coming from more than Mexico. It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably-- probably-- from the Middle East. But we don't know. Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening. And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast.Trump was referring to illegal aliens coming over the U.S.-Mexico border who commit additional crimes, such as rape. As Breitbart Texas has extensively documented, it's common for human traffickers to ""to sexually assault or rape the females"" en route to the U.S., and the smugglers ""usually remove an article of clothing from the female they rape and they tie it tightly to a tree--a rape tree."" Furthermore, it is true that as the U.S. suffers from a massive heroin epidemic that killed over 47,000 people in 2014 alone, ""nearly all"" of the heroin consumed in the U.S. is smuggled in by Mexican traffickers, as the Washington Post found. Drug trafficking is an inherently violent operation.  UPDATE: Later in Tuesday night's vice presidential debate, while trying to attack Trump's detailed immigration policy proposals, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine again claimed that Donald Trump and Mike Pence said ""all Mexicans are bad."" Fact Check: FALSE. These words have never been uttered by either the Republican presidential nominee or vice presidential nominee. Again, Trump specifically criticized the rampant criminal activities committed by illegal aliens coming across the U.S.-Mexico border, many of whom are Mexican nationals.Fact check: FALSE.The stop-and-frisk policy dates back to a 1968 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that allowed police to stop and frisk in individual based on a reasonable suspicion that he or she is armed and dangerous and may be involved in a crime. The policy has been constitutional for nearly four decades. During that time, and especially during the last two decades (until the last two years), relationships between police and communities have improved. After Bill de Blasio became mayor of New York in 2014, that city dropped stop-and-frisk. That coincided with a precipitous decline in the relationship between police and communities. If stop-and-frisk were the cause of the friction, ending that policy would have resulted in better and more harmonious relationships. Stop-and-frisk has nothing to do with the present controversy.by Frances Martel4 Oct 2016""Did you know Iran was racing toward a nuclear weapon and Russia was expanding its stockpile?"" Kaine asked, adding later, ""Under Secretary Clinton's leadership... [the United States] worked a tough negotiation with nations around the world to eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program without firing a shot.""There is no evidence that the Islamic Republic of Iran has abandoned its nuclear ambitions, and subsequent revelations of secret ""side deals"" as part of the greater JCPoA exposed the fact that Iran may be able to double its uranium enrichment capacity after a decade.The Iranian nuclear deal was signed in July 2015. A year later, the Associated Press published the provisions hidden in a document not publicly available previously, which elucidated what would happen to the Iranian nuclear program after the first ten years of the agreement's implementation. According to that document, Iran will be allowed to begin ""replacing its mainstay centrifuges with thousands of advanced machines."" While it will ultimately possess fewer centrifuges to enrich uranium with, these machines will be so efficient, the AP notes, that ""they will allow Iran to enrich at more than twice the rate it is doing now.""A report released this September by the Institute for Science and International Security found that the deal will also allow, through an exemption, Iran to keep 50 tons of heavy water and ""continue operating 19 'hot cell' radiation containment chambers.""Possessing materials such as enriched uranium and heavy water does not necessarily mean Iran will have the capacity to restore its nuclear program. The deal will not allow nuclear inspectors to confirm, however, whether or not Iran is complying with the deal. Iran got negotiators to agree that no U.S. nuclear inspectors will be allowed on Iranian soil.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has done little to calm those alarmed by the possibility of Iran having access to advance uranium enrichment technology. Shortly after the signing of the deal, he published a book titled Palestine, in which he argues that Iran has a role to play in the destruction of Israel, and so must work to create and possess the strongest weapons possible.In May, Trump said he thought minimum wage levels should be left to the states, and offered the opinion that the current minimum wage sounds too low for workers to make a decent living. Later, in August, he expressed support for raising the minimum wage to $10 per hour, but still preferred to let state governments handle the issue.""I have seen what's going on. And I don't know how people make it on $7.25 an hour. Now, with that being said, I would like to see an increase of some magnitude. But I'd rather leave it to the states. Let the states decide. Because don't forget, the states have to compete with each other,"" Trump said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on May 8, 2016.Asked by NBC's Chuck Todd if he thought the federal government should set a minimum wage floor, Trump replied:No, I'd rather have the states go out and do what they have to do. And the states compete with each other, not only other countries, but they compete with each other, Chuck. So I like the idea of let the states decide. But I think people should get more. I think they're out there. They're working. It is a very low number. You know, with what's happened to the economy, with what's happened to the cost. I mean, it's just- I don't know how you live on $7.25 an hour. But I would say let the states decide.In August, Trump told Bill O'Reilly of Fox News that he still does not believe there ""has to be"" a federal minimum wage, but added, ""I would leave it and raise it somewhat. You need to help people. I know it's not very Republican to say.""When O'Reilly proposed a $10 minimum wage, Trump replied, ""I would say 10. I would say 10. But with the understanding that somebody like me is going to bring back jobs. I don't want people to be in that $10 category for very long. But the thing is, Bill, let the states make the deal.""Trump has maintained this position in several subsequent comments: he believes the minimum wage should be raised to $10, but the states should do it, not the federal government.by AWR Hawkins4 Oct 2016He used the example of the April 16, 2007, Virginia Tech attack to make his point. During that attack a gunman walked into gun-free zones on the Virginia Tech campus, shooting and killing 32 innocents. What Kaine failed to mention is that the Virginia Tech gunman passed a background check for his firearm. And the Virginia Tech gunman is not an anomaly among mass public attackers, Breitbart News previously reported that the vast majority of public attackers-and alleged attackers-of recent memory all acquired their guns via background checks. These include:In addition to these examples, Paris, France, has extremely comprehensive background checks-even more comprehensive than those in California-yet they also suffered 12 shot and killed during the January 7, 2015, Charlie Hebdo attack and lost another 130 innocents killed during a November 13, 2015, firearm-based terror attack in the city.The bottom line: Kaine's statement that background checks ""make us safer"" is only true if you dismiss all the instances in which they haven't.Donald Trump has never made the U.S. alliance with Israel conditional. Period. That part of the statement -- ""ONLY work together with Israel if..."" -- is 100% false.As for the phrase ""big league,"" Trump did use those words -- but not specifically in relation to Israel. He was talking, in general, about countries that America defends. Israel is not one of them: the U.S. provides money for Israeli defense, but does not defend Israel directly. Here is Trump's exact quote, as reported by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency:At a news conference in Washington, D.C., on Monday, the Republican presidential front-runner was asked whether he believed the Israeli government should pay for American defense, as he had called for other U.S. allies, such as South Korea, Japan and Saudi Arabia, to do.""I think Israel will do that also, yeah, I think Israel do -- there are many countries that can pay and they can pay big league,"" Trump responded.""Later that day, Trump gave a well-received speech at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) annual policy conference.In fact, as CNN Money noted in a July profile of Pence, he was a ""leading fiscal conservative"" during his 12 years in Congress, and ""backed various efforts to reform Social Security in a bid to make the program solvent for the long term and to reduce government spending."" As CNN Money noted, one of those reform plans was proposed by President George W. Bush. Pence and other conservatives had ""previously proposed a similar but more aggressive reform plan than Bush's - one that would have phased in faster and let workers put more of their payroll taxes into private accounts.""It is a common liberal caricature of these proposals to claim they would have wiped out Social Security, but this is merely hysterical rhetoric, of the sort deployed against all serious reform efforts. Allowing workers the option to put some of their money into private accounts would not have ""repealed"" or ""destroyed"" Social Security; those who proposed such reforms were explicitly attempting to save the system, which is unquestionably heading for insolvency, according to the Social Security trustees themselves.CNN Money also recalled Pence stating that cuts to Social Security payments, or increases to the retirement age, were ""on the table"" in 2010. ""I think everything has to be on the table. I'm an all-of-the-above guy. We need look at everything on the menu,"" Pence declared.Most politicians, including most Democrats, make similar statements about looking at all options to keep Social Security solvent for as long as possible. President Barack Obama proposed cuts to Social Security benefits in his budget for fiscal 2015, for example. Raising the retirement age is frequently discussed as a way to keep the system running as the U.S. population ages, although the idea is always controversial. As for Donald Trump, he has said, ""I will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is."" He added, however, that ""as our demography changes, a prudent administration would begin to examine what changes might be necessary for future generations.""""The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways because Bin Laden is dead,"" Kaine argued, receiving the question to answer before rival Mike Pence. ""The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways because the Iranian nuclear weapons program has been stopped,"" he added, arguing that U.S. troops are also safer because there are ""not 175,000 in a dangerous part in the world, there's only 15,000.""The death of Al Qaeda head Osama bin Laden with little strategy for what to do with the beheaded jihadi organization has led to the terror group splintering into multiple factions. Al Qaeda in Iraq, once led by former terror camp leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, evolved into what is now known as the Islamic State, led by self-appointed caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The Al Qaeda affiliated militia al-Nusra Front has officially severed from its parent terrorist group in Syria, and continues operating as a jihadist terror group under the name ""Jabhat Fateh al-Sham.""Despite parenting new, deadly terror threats, Al Qaeda itself remains extremely formidable, expanding out of terrorist attacks and into ""drug trafficking affiliated with Mexican drug cartels, kidnapping for ransom, smuggling of arms, wildlife, coal, oil, gas, timber, precious metals, and people."" ""This has enabled them not only to become independent but also richer and more powerful,"" according to a Global Terrorism Index (GTI) report.Al Qaeda has also cemented itself in regions destabilized during Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, notably Libya and Yemen.Kaine's claim that the Iranian nuclear deal (the ""Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action"" - JCPoA) eliminates the Iranian nuclear program entirely has been proven inaccurate.The Chairman of the 9/11 Commission has said that the threat of terrorism worldwide is greater in 2016 than in 2001. For a numerical analysis, the Global Terrorism Index (GTI) documented 32,685 terrorist-caused deaths in 2014, compared to slightly over 5,000 in 2001.In truth, Pence said Putin was a ""stronger leader"" than Obama, which is very different from Kaine's characterization of his remarks.""I think it's inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country. And that's going to change the day that Donald Trump becomes president,"" Pence said during an interview with Dana Bash of CNN, responding to a question about Donald Trump making a similar comment the previous evening at the Commander-in-Chief forum. Pence also noted Trump ""said last night he doesn't particularly like the system"" in Russia. Fact check: FALSE.Kaine used a repeated -- and made-up -- Obama administration talking point, citing supposed ""experts"" inside Israeli intelligence who back the Iran deal. In August, the Israeli government responded directly to Obama's claim -- which Kaine, regrettably, repeated.As the Times of Israel reported:A top minister close to Netanyahu, meanwhile, directly contradicted Obama's assertion that Israeli security officials now back the accord. ""I don't know to which Israelis he (Obama) spoke recently. But I can promise you that the position of the prime minister, the defense minister and of most senior officials in the defense establishment has not changed,"" Tzachi Hanegbi told The Times of Israel.""The opposite is the case. The time that has elapsed since the deal was signed proved all our worries that, regrettably, we were justified before the deal was made,"" said Hanegbi, a minister who works in the Prime Minister's Office and who until recently chaired the Knesset's powerful Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. The Defense Ministry used more emotive language to contradict Obama.""The Israeli defense establishment believes that agreements have value only if they are based on the existing reality, but they have no value if the facts on the ground are the complete opposite of those the deal is based upon,"" the Ministry said in a statement.Later, Kaine repeated his claim, citing Gadi Eizenkot, one of Israel's military leaders. Eizenkot was cautiously optimistic about the deal when it went into effect, but did not say that it had stopped or eliminated Iran's nuclear program, nor even that it prevented an Iranian nuclear weapon. He said that the deal ""has many risks, but also presents many opportunities."" That is far from Kaine's claim.Fact check: FALSE.It is not a new claim -- and left-leaning Snopes.com had the chance to review it earlier in the year, declaring it a ""mixture"": WHAT'S TRUE: The charity ranking site CharityWatch grades the Clinton Foundation as an ""A"" and the Red Cross as an ""A-.""WHAT'S FALSE: The larger and more highly regarded Charity Navigator has refused to evaluate the Clinton Foundation after an early 2015 dispute over bad press and allegations of a lack of transparency; on 1 September 2016, Charity Navigator reinstated the Foundation's rating.Snopes.com adds: ""How much credence one should afford these rankings is debatable, however. Charity Navigator is the much larger and more highly regarded site.""In addition, Charity Navigator had put the Clinton Foundation on a ""watch list,"" partly due to concerns over donations from foreign governments during Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. It reinstated the Clinton Foundation, conveniently, in time for the 2016 presidential election.The integrity of the American Red Cross has never been in question. Not so, the Clinton Foundation.Kaine claimed to be proud of the boycott at the time. ""I'm not dumb, I knew not going to the speech might make some folks mad with me - there would be a political price, but I felt so strongly as a matter of principle that this was done in an entirely inappropriate way,"" he told Forward, denouncing Netanyahu's speech as ""done purely to try and influence the Israeli elections and demonstrate American support for one person and one party.""Kaine was particularly incensed by Netanyahu's criticism of the Iran nuclear deal - the same deal he now claims Israel supports.""Kaine worked behind the scenes to try to delay the speech, but when that failed, was among the first Democratic senators to announce that they would not attend the address,"" the Times of Israel reported in July.The New York Sun had little patience for Kaine's claims to have ""paid a price"" for his stance: ""As for the price Mr. Kaine has supposedly paid for his willingness to boycott Mr. Netanyahu's speech, he can now count his selection as his party's vice presidential nominee. What a cost.""The Sun declared that Clinton's choice of ""one of the eight Democrats who boycotted Prime Minister Netanyahu's address last year to a joint meeting of Congress"" as her running mate was ""one marker of the fact that for all Mrs. Clinton's protestations of support for the Jewish State, it would be a fool's wager to count on her when the chips are down.""by Jerome Hudson4 Oct 2016What Senator Kaine failed to mention is that the governor of Virginia during Johns' walk-out was a Democrat named John Stewart Battle.Johns was protesting Virginia's segregated public school systems. It was in 1951 when a 16-year-old Johns walked out of her Moton High School, an all-black school in Farmville, Virginia, which sat across the street from an all-white high school. Battle, who was elected Virginia governor in 1950, was known widely as a segregationist -- and he governed as such. According to the Encyclopedia of Virginia, ""when the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, or NAACP, demanded the desegregation of state parks, Battle raised the possibility of closing them instead.""This is absolutely false.Indeed, during Donald Trump's immigration policy on Wednesday August 31 in Phoenix, the Republican presidential nominee promised the audience that on ""day one"" the ""2 million riminal aliens now inside of our country"" are ""gone.""Trump said his administration will have ""zero tolerance for criminal aliens.""The portion of Trump's immigration speech where he talks about deporting illegal aliens can be found below:According to federal data, there are at least 2 million, 2 million, think of it, criminal aliens now inside of our country, 2 million people criminal aliens. We will begin moving them out day one. As soon as I take office. Day one. In joint operation with local, state, and federal law enforcement.Fact check: FALSE.That is not unconstitutional. That is current U.S. immigration policy. We prefer some countries over others. That is constitutional, lawful, and logical.There is no U.S. constitutional provision providing equal protection for people based on national origin -- certainly when they are not yet in the United States!Kaine went further, saying that it was unconstitutional for Donald Trump to ""keep them out if they're Muslim."" Trump has since softened that stance somewhat, and now wants to keep people out from terror-prone countries. But regardless, the constitutional protection against religious discrimination does not apply to people who are not yet immigrants, residents or citizens.In fact, our current immigration policy ""discriminates"" against Muslims because it does not permit people to bring over their spouses from polygamous marriages, which are permitted in many Muslim countries. That kind of discrimination is constitutional and lawful.It would, arguably, be appropriate for the U.S. to discriminate in favor of some religions -- such as Christians and Yazidis -- who are subject to discrimination and persecution in the Muslim world.Regardless, it would be constitutional to do so.Fact check: MOSTLY TRUE.Pence is right, according to a report from the Heartland Institute, a conservative policy organization. His claim might, however, understate the role of the Second World War, which jump-started the economy -- not through spending, but by relaxing many of the restrictions that had slowed recovery from the Great Depression.So others say it is simply the slowest since World War II, or 1949. Regardless, it has been slow.Kaine's numbers, by contrast, fell short. He claimed that the Obama administration had created 15 million jobs -- a claim that only works if you ignore the first year of Obama's presidency, when unemployment continued to rise. Kaine overstated the number of jobs created by some 5 million.None other than the Washington Post's fact-checker, Glenn Kessler, disputed the Clinton campaign's ""15 million jobs"" talking point: ""Clinton frequently indicates that she's talking about the entire Obama administration. She uses phrases such 'than when they took office' or 'in the last 7 1/2 years.' But that's 5 million jobs too many.""And that's without looking at the decline in household wealth, the rise in the number of Americans who have dropped out of the labor force, and the staggering national debt that produced virtually nothing, jobs-wise, for $10 trillion in deficit spending.So you've got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care and then the people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. It's the craziest thing in the world.Look, the Affordable Health Care Act did a world of good, and the 50-something efforts to repeal it that the Republicans have staged were a terrible mistake. We, for the first time in our history, at least are providing insurance to more than 90% of our people. But there is a group of people -- mostly small business owners and employees -- who make just a little too much money to qualify for Medicaid expansion or for the tax incentives who can't get affordable health insurance premiums in a lot of places. And the reason is they're not in big pools, so they have no bargaining power.
When do we beat Mexico at the border? They're laughing at us, at our stupidity. And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. But they're killing us economically.
The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems.
Thank you. It's true, and these are the best and the finest. When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.
But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we're getting. And it only makes common sense. It only makes common sense. They're sending us not the right people.
It's coming from more than Mexico. It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably-- probably-- from the Middle East. But we don't know. Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening. And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast.

No, I'd rather have the states go out and do what they have to do. And the states compete with each other, not only other countries, but they compete with each other, Chuck. So I like the idea of let the states decide. But I think people should get more. I think they're out there. They're working. It is a very low number. You know, with what's happened to the economy, with what's happened to the cost. I mean, it's just- I don't know how you live on $7.25 an hour. But I would say let the states decide.

These include:Breitbart News previously reportedthe Orlando attacker (June 12)the UCLA gunman (June 1)the San Bernardino attackers (December 2, 2015)the Colorado Springs attacker (October 31, 2015)the Umpqua Community College attacker (October 1, 2015)Alison Parker's attacker (August 26, 2015)the Lafayette movie theater attacker (July 23, 2015)the Chattanooga attacker (July 16, 2015)the alleged Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal attacker (Jun 17, 2015)the Muhammad Carton Contest attackers (May 3, 2014)the Las Vegas cop killers (June 9, 2015)the Santa Barbara attacker (May 23, 2014)the Fort Hood attacker (April 2, 2014)the Arapahoe High School attacker (December 13, 2013)the D.C. Navy Yard attacker (September 16, 2013)the Aurora movie theater attacker (July 20, 2012)Gabby Giffords's attacker (January 8, 2011)the Fort Hood attacker (November 5, 2009)the Virginia Tech attacker (April 16, 2007)the Jewish Federation of Greater Seattle attacker (July 28, 2016)In addition to these examples, Paris, France, has extremely comprehensive background checks-even more comprehensive than those in California-yet they also suffered 12 shot and killed during the January 7, 2015, Charlie Hebdo attack and lost another 130 innocents killed during a November 13, 2015, firearm-based terror attack in the city.The bottom line: Kaine's statement that background checks ""make us safer"" is only true if you dismiss all the instances in which they haven't.Donald Trump said that ""we'll only work together with Israel if they pay 'big league'.""Donald Trump has never made the U.S. alliance with Israel conditional. Period. That part of the statement -- ""ONLY work together with Israel if..."" -- is 100% false.As for the phrase ""big league,"" Trump did use those words -- but not specifically in relation to Israel. He was talking, in general, about countries that America defends. Israel is not one of them: the U.S. provides money for Israeli defense, but does not defend Israel directly. Here is Trump's exact quote, as reported by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency:Jewish Telegraphic AgencyAt a news conference in Washington, D.C., on Monday, the Republican presidential front-runner was asked whether he believed the Israeli government should pay for American defense, as he had called for other U.S. allies, such as South Korea, Japan and Saudi Arabia, to do.""I think Israel will do that also, yeah, I think Israel do -- there are many countries that can pay and they can pay big league,"" Trump responded.""Later that day, Trump gave a well-received speech at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) annual policy conference.Tim Kaine claimed that Mike Pence has attempted to repeal Social Security. In fact, as CNN Money noted in a July profile of Pence, he was a ""leading fiscal conservative"" during his 12 years in Congress, and ""backed various efforts to reform Social Security in a bid to make the program solvent for the long term and to reduce government spending."" CNN MoneyAs CNN Money noted, one of those reform plans was proposed by President George W. Bush. Pence and other conservatives had ""previously proposed a similar but more aggressive reform plan than Bush's - one that would have phased in faster and let workers put more of their payroll taxes into private accounts.""It is a common liberal caricature of these proposals to claim they would have wiped out Social Security, but this is merely hysterical rhetoric, of the sort deployed against all serious reform efforts. Allowing workers the option to put some of their money into private accounts would not have ""repealed"" or ""destroyed"" Social Security; those who proposed such reforms were explicitly attempting to save the system, which is unquestionably heading for insolvency, according to the Social Security trustees themselves.accordingCNN Money also recalled Pence stating that cuts to Social Security payments, or increases to the retirement age, were ""on the table"" in 2010. ""I think everything has to be on the table. I'm an all-of-the-above guy. We need look at everything on the menu,"" Pence declared.Most politicians, including most Democrats, make similar statements about looking at all options to keep Social Security solvent for as long as possible. President Barack Obama proposed cuts to Social Security benefits in his budget for fiscal 2015, for example. Raising the retirement age is frequently discussed as a way to keep the system running as the U.S. population ages, although the idea is always controversial. proposed cuts to Social Security benefitsAs for Donald Trump, he has said, ""I will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is."" has saidHe added, however, that ""as our demography changes, a prudent administration would begin to examine what changes might be necessary for future generations.""Asked during Tuesday night's Vice Presidential debate whether the threat of terrorism in the United States has increased or decreased in the past eight years, Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine argued that the threat of terrorism has decreased ""in some ways"" because of the reduction in the number of deployed troops, the passage of the Iran nuclear deal, and the death of Osama bin Laden.""The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways because Bin Laden is dead,"" Kaine argued, receiving the question to answer before rival Mike Pence. ""The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways because the Iranian nuclear weapons program has been stopped,"" he added, arguing that U.S. troops are also safer because there are ""not 175,000 in a dangerous part in the world, there's only 15,000.""The death of Al Qaeda head Osama bin Laden with little strategy for what to do with the beheaded jihadi organization has led to the terror group splintering into multiple factions. Al Qaeda in Iraq, once led by former terror camp leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, evolved into what is now known as the Islamic State, led by self-appointed caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The Al Qaeda affiliated militia al-Nusra Front has officially severed from its parent terrorist group in Syria, and continues operating as a jihadist terror group under the name ""Jabhat Fateh al-Sham.""Abu Musab al-Zarqawial-Nusra FrontDespite parenting new, deadly terror threats, Al Qaeda itself remains extremely formidable, expanding out of terrorist attacks and into ""drug trafficking affiliated with Mexican drug cartels, kidnapping for ransom, smuggling of arms, wildlife, coal, oil, gas, timber, precious metals, and people."" extremely formidabledrug trafficking""This has enabled them not only to become independent but also richer and more powerful,"" according to a Global Terrorism Index (GTI) report.Global Terrorism Index (GTI)Al Qaeda has also cemented itself in regions destabilized during Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, notably Libya and Yemen.LibyaYemenKaine's claim that the Iranian nuclear deal (the ""Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action"" - JCPoA) eliminates the Iranian nuclear program entirely has been proven inaccurate.proven inaccurateThe Chairman of the 9/11 Commission has said that the threat of terrorism worldwide is greater in 2016 than in 2001. For a numerical analysis, the Global Terrorism Index (GTI) documented 32,685 terrorist-caused deaths in 2014, compared to slightly over 5,000 in 2001.greater in 2016 than in 2001Tim Kaine claimed that Indiana Governor Mike Pence said that Russian President Vladimir Putin was ""inarguably a better leader than Barack Obama."" In truth, Pence said Putin was a ""stronger leader"" than Obama, which is very different from Kaine's characterization of his remarks.""I think it's inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country. And that's going to change the day that Donald Trump becomes president,"" Pence said during an interview with Dana Bash of CNNCNN, responding to a question about Donald Trump making a similar comment the previous evening at the Commander-in-Chief forum. Pence also noted Trump ""said last night he doesn't particularly like the system"" in Russia. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) claimed several times in the vice presidential debate that the Iran deal stopped, or even ""eliminated,"" the Iranian nuclear program. Midway through the debate, he tried to cite the Israeli military in his defense: ""even the Israeli military"" agreed, he said.Kaine used a repeated -- and made-up -- Obama administration talking point, citing supposed ""experts"" inside Israeli intelligence who back the Iran deal. In August, the Israeli government responded directly to Obama's claim -- which Kaine, regrettably, repeated.As the Times of Israel reported:reportedA top minister close to Netanyahu, meanwhile, directly contradicted Obama's assertion that Israeli security officials now back the accord. ""I don't know to which Israelis he (Obama) spoke recently. But I can promise you that the position of the prime minister, the defense minister and of most senior officials in the defense establishment has not changed,"" Tzachi Hanegbi told The Times of Israel.""The opposite is the case. The time that has elapsed since the deal was signed proved all our worries that, regrettably, we were justified before the deal was made,"" said Hanegbi, a minister who works in the Prime Minister's Office and who until recently chaired the Knesset's powerful Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.The Defense Ministry used more emotive language to contradict Obama.""The Israeli defense establishment believes that agreements have value only if they are based on the existing reality, but they have no value if the facts on the ground are the complete opposite of those the deal is based upon,"" the Ministry said in a statement.Later, Kaine repeated his claim, citing Gadi Eizenkot, one of Israel's military leaders. Eizenkot was cautiously optimistic about the deal when it went into effect, but did not say that it had stopped or eliminated Iran's nuclear program, nor even that it prevented an Iranian nuclear weapon. He said that the deal ""has many risks, but also presents many opportunities."" That is far from Kaine's claim.cautiously optimisticKaine tried to claim that the Clinton Foundation is not a pay-to-play scheme, but ""a foundation that does good work,"" -- so good, in fact, that it ""gets higher rankings for its charity than the American Red Cross.""Fact check: FALSE.It is not a new claim -- and left-leaning Snopes.com had the chance to review it earlier in the year, declaring it a ""mixture"":reviewWHAT'S TRUE: The charity ranking site CharityWatch grades the Clinton Foundation as an ""A"" and the Red Cross as an ""A-.""WHAT'S FALSE: The larger and more highly regarded Charity Navigator has refused to evaluate the Clinton Foundation after an early 2015 dispute over bad press and allegations of a lack of transparency; on 1 September 2016, Charity Navigator reinstated the Foundation's rating.Snopes.com adds: ""How much credence one should afford these rankings is debatable, however. Charity Navigator is the much larger and more highly regarded site.""In addition, Charity Navigator had put the Clinton Foundation on a ""watch list,"" partly due to concerns over donations from foreign governments during Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. It reinstated the Clinton Foundation, conveniently, in time for the 2016 presidential election.reinstatedThe integrity of the American Red Cross has never been in question. Not so, the Clinton Foundation.Contrary to his denials, Democratic vice presidential nominee and Virginia Senator Tim Kaine most certainly was a leader in the boycott of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to Congress in March 2015.Kaine claimed to be proud of the boycott at the time. ""I'm not dumb, I knew not going to the speech might make some folks mad with me - there would be a political price, but I felt so strongly as a matter of principle that this was done in an entirely inappropriate way,"" he told Forward, denouncing Netanyahu's speech as ""done purely to try and influence the Israeli elections and demonstrate American support for one person and one party.""ForwardKaine was particularly incensed by Netanyahu's criticism of the Iran nuclear deal - the same deal he now claims Israel supports.""Kaine worked behind the scenes to try to delay the speech, but when that failed, was among the first Democratic senators to announce that they would not attend the address,"" the Times of Israel reported in July.Times of IsraelThe New York Sun had little patience for Kaine's claims to have ""paid a price"" for his stance: ""As for the price Mr. Kaine has supposedly paid for his willingness to boycott Mr. Netanyahu's speech, he can now count his selection as his party's vice presidential nominee. What a cost.""New York SunThe Sun declared that Clinton's choice of ""one of the eight Democrats who boycotted Prime Minister Netanyahu's address last year to a joint meeting of Congress"" as her running mate was ""one marker of the fact that for all Mrs. Clinton's protestations of support for the Jewish State, it would be a fool's wager to count on her when the chips are down.""by Jerome HudsonWhile answering the first question of the vice-presidential debate Tuesday, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine mentioned Barbara Johns, who ""led a walk-out of her high school; She made history by protesting school segregation."" Johns was protesting Virginia's segregated public school systems. It was in 1951 when a 16-year-old Johns walked out of her Moton High School, an all-black school in Farmville, Virginia, which sat across the street from an all-white high school. Battle, who was elected Virginia governor in 1950, was known widely as a segregationist -- and he governed as such. segregationistAccording to the Encyclopedia of Virginia, ""when the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, or NAACP, demanded the desegregation of state parks, Battle raised the possibility of closing them instead.""Encyclopedia of VirginiaWhile responding to a question about immigration enforcement Tuesday at the vice-presidential debate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine said, ""when Donald Trump spoke in Phoenix, he looked the audience in the eye and said 'No, we're building and we're deporting everybody.' He said, quote, 'They will all be gone.'"" This is absolutely false.Indeed, during Donald Trump's immigration policy on Wednesday August 31 in Phoenix, the Republican presidential nominee promised the audience that on ""day one"" the ""2 million riminal aliens now inside of our country"" are ""gone.""Trump said his administration will have ""zero tolerance for criminal aliens.""saidThe portion of Trump's immigration speech where he talks about deporting illegal aliens can be found below:Trump's immigration speechAccording to federal data, there are at least 2 million, 2 million, think of it, criminal aliens now inside of our country, 2 million people criminal aliens. We will begin moving them out day one. As soon as I take office. Day one. In joint operation with local, state, and federal law enforcement. Heartland Institute, a conservative policy organization. Heartland InstituteHis claim might, however, understate the role of the Second World War, which jump-started the economy -- not through spending, but by relaxing many of the restrictions that had slowed recovery from the Great Depression.So others say it is simply the slowest since World War II, or 1949. 1949None other than the Washington Post's fact-checker, Glenn Kessler, disputed the Clinton campaign's ""15 million jobs"" talking point: ""Clinton frequently indicates that she's talking about the entire Obama administration. She uses phrases such 'than when they took office' or 'in the last 7 1/2 years.' But that's 5 million jobs too many.""disputedAnd that's without looking at the decline in household wealth, the rise in the number of Americans who have dropped out of the labor force, and the staggering national debt that produced virtually nothing, jobs-wise, for $10 trillion in deficit spending."

With a solid debate performance, Trump could have put Clinton's campaign on the ropes by giving undecided voters who want change some reasons to vote for him. But after an unprepared Trump missed opportunity after opportunity to make the case against Clinton--and for himself--before a record audience, the momentum this week is on Clinton-Kaine's side. Trump squandered all of the momentum he had in national and swing-state polls with a debate performance that made Hillary Clinton look like Bill Belichick with her discipline and game plan while Trump seemed like a lost rookie quarterback who did not even bother to learn the team's plays.And this debate, which takes place in Kaine's home state of Virginia, has the feel of one in which Kaine will have a short field for 90 minutes, especially if most of the questions will focus on all of Trump's recent ""scandals."" The seasoned Pence, who will not be unprepared and will not wing it, must flip the field back in Team Trump's favor before Trump's second debate with Clinton on Sunday.Stay tuned to Breitbart News for live updates.All times eastern. --12:22: It seemed like Team Clinton were going for it on fourth down deep in Team Trump's territory late in the fourth quarter to ice the game and got stuffed.

Pence says bin Laden led al Qaeda and the primary threat to day is ISIS. He says because of Clinton's failure to negotiate a status of forces agreement, ISIS was strengthened. Pence is now asked about Trump's proposed ""extreme vetting"" of new immigrants, and he says it really begins with America reforming its immigration system so we don't bring into the country those who are hostile to our way of life. Pence mentions that he and Trump are committed to suspending the Syrian refugee program.9:46: Debate now turns to terrorism. Kaine says the terrorist threat has decreased since Osama bin Laden is dead and the Iran deal was signed. Kaine says Clinton is the best person to defeat terrorism even though she was responsible for the rest of ISIS in the Middle East. Kaine goes over Clinton's plan to defeat ""ISIL."" Kaine says Trump can't start a Twitter war with Miss Universe without shooting himself in the foot. He mocks Trump for not having a plan and claiming to know more about terrorism than the generals. Kaine says Trump loves dictators and has a personal Mt. Rushmore-Putin, Kim Jong-Un, Qaddafi, Hussein. Kaine now slams Trump for his cavalier attitude re: nuclear proliferation. Pence wonders how long Kaine worked on that response.9:44: Pence talks about the tragedy and heartbreak Americans have faced because of illegal immigrant crime as Quijano keeps focusing on illegal immigrants who have not committed crimes instead of the horrific and preventable crimes that have been committed by illegal immigrants. Framing is everything. She could have easily pressed Kaine to defend open-borders policies that allowed people like Kate Steinle and Jamiel Shaw to be murdered. But, as is the case with mainstream press, she is instead pressing Pence to defend deporting illegal immigrants who have not committed crimes. Kaine says he can't imagine how Pence can defend Trump's comments about Judge Curiel.9:43: Pence says Kaine/Clinton have a plan for ""amnesty"" and ""open borders."" He says the last thing Kaine mentioned was border security and points out that a nation without borders is not a nation.9:41: Kaine says he and Clinton believe in ""comprehensive immigration reform"" (code word for massive amnesty) while Trump believes in deportations  (""deportation nation""). He says Trump wants to go house to house and business to business and kick out 16 million people (wasn't the number supposedly 13 million? Now it's 16 million?)9:38: Debate now turns to immigration. Quijano asks what they would tell illegal immigrants who have not committed crimes. Pence says Clinton and Kaine want to continue the policies of open borders, amnesty, sanctuary cities and catch and release that are driving wages down. Pence says Trump has an immigration plan that will ""deal systematically with illegal immigration"" that will deal with border security. Pence says the ICE Union endorsed Trump, marking the group's first ever presidential endorsement. Pence again fires back at Kaine, pointing out that Clinton called half of Trump-Pence's supporters ""deplorables"" and ""irredeemable."" He says Trump's comments are ""small potatoes"" compared to Clinton's deplorables remark. Kaine says Clinton apologized while Trump never apologized for his remarks. Quijano stops Pence from interrupting when she continued to let Kaine interrupt over and over again.9:34: Kaine says people shouldn't be afraid to bring up bias in law enforcement officers. Pence mentions that when an African-American police officer is involved in a police shooting of an African-American man, why would Clinton use the incident to talk about implicit biases. Quijano brings up Sen. Tim Scott's (R-SC) experience about being stopped seven times by police officers and asks Pence what he would say to Scott. Pence says we should adopt board criminal justice reform and we have to do a better job recognizing an correcting errors in the system. But he says we should not have the reflex of assuming the worst in law enforcement after every tragedy. Pence says law enforcement is a force for good in the country. Quijano keeps pressing Pence on what he would tell Sen. Scott. Kaine jumps in and bring up Trump's comments about women, Judge Curiel, and John McCain.9:32: Trump weighs in:.@mike_pence is doing a great job - so far, no contest!-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 20169:31: Pence says his uncle was a cop and was his hero. He says police officers are the ""best of us"" because they put their lives on the line every single day. Pence says, at the risk of agreeing with Kaine, that community policing is a ""great idea."" Pence says he and Trump will ensure that law and order is restored in the cities. Pence says law enforcement officers hear the ""bad-mouthing"" coming from people who seize upon tragedies to use a ""broad bush"" to accuse law enforcement officials of ""institutional racism"" and ""implicit bias."" Pence says we have to stop seizing on these moments of tragedy to demean law enforcement broadly.[Clinton said we all have biases during last week's debate when asked about policing.]9:30: Debate now turns to race relations and policing. Candidates are asked if we put too much on the shoulders of police officers. Kaine speaks about the need for ""community policing"" and slams Trump's support of ""stop and frisk."" Kaine then pushes gun control and says he has a lot of ""scar tissue"" before mentioning the Virginia Tech massacre that occurred while he was governor.Tim Kaine seems nervous; he usually talks about Virginia Tech in extraordinarily moving way. Now talking quickly through it-- Kasie Hunt (@kasie) October 5, 20169:27: Pence says he and Trump will meet the obligations of Social Security and Medicare and accuses Kaine of engaging in ""scare tactics"" on the subject.9:21: Quijano asks Pence if it is fair that Trump may not have paid federal income taxes. Pence says Kaine and Clinton want more taxes and regulation and if voters think more of that is working, then they should vote for Democrats. Pence says Kaine can spin the numbers but people in towns like Scranton ""know different."" When pressed about Trump's taxes, Pence says Trump is a businessman and not a career politician. Pence says Trump faced some tough times-like the New York Times-and he used the tax code just the way it was supposed to be used. Pence says Trump has created tens of thousands of jobs and has paid payroll taxes, property taxes, etc. Kaine says Trump has broken his first promise by not releasing his taxes. Kaine says Pence gave Trump his tax returns and Trump must give Americans his tax returns to prove that he is qualified. Quijano says viewers at home cannot understand anything when they speak over each other... but it's mostly Kaine who is interrupting over and over again.9:19: Kaine says voters need to decide if they want a ""you're hired"" president in Clinton or ""you're fired"" president in Donald Trump. Kaine claims Trump and Pence want to eliminate the federal minimum wage. Kaine claims Trump and Pence will put the economy back into a recession with their plan. Kaine says if Trump released his tax returns, Americans would see how much his economic plan is a ""Trump-first plan.""[Not really a good case here because Trump wants to fire the bureaucrats and the trade deals that Clinton has supported has led to many Americans in manufacturing towns losing their jobs.]9:16: Candidates now asked about the economy. They are asked if they are concerned that adding more to the debt will be disastrous of the country. Pence says the debt has doubled under the Obama administration. He touts Indiana's fiscal responsibility under his leadership. He points out that Kaine left Virginia $2 billion in debt and tried to massively raise taxes. Pence says Kaine is a ""fitting running mate for Hillary Clinton"" because in a season where Americans are struggling under the Obama administration, Clinton and Kaine just want more of the same and are advocating a $1 trillion increase in taxes. Pence now points out that even President Clinton has called Obamacare a ""crazy plan."" Pence talks about trade deals that will put American workers first, which will help the economy grow again.9:15: Kaine's the one interrupting and frustrating viewers:can't. understand. you. when. you. talk. over. each. other. #VPDebate-- Cecilia Vega (@CeciliaVegaABC) October 5, 20169:14: Kaine says Pence is Trump's ""Apprentice"" and keeps interrupting Pence. Pence says Americans distrust Clinton because they are paying attention. Pence is slamming Clinton on the Clinton Foundation scandals and her email server. Kaine raises his eyebrow and annoyingly keeps interrupting. Not coming across well. Seems too eager to interrupt Pence every time Pence speaks. Kaine knows that talking about Clinton's honesty and foreign policy is bad for their campaign:Debating Obama WH foreign policy -> not at all where Kaine wants to be-- Josh Kraushaar (@HotlineJosh) October 5, 20169:12: Pence is asked why voters do not think Trump has the temperament to be president. Pence first mention that the Middle East is spinning out of control because of Clinton's foreign policy.Pence is right. Clinton & Obama tried to negotiate an Iraq troop extension but failed. Bush admin always anticipated such an extension.-- Josh Rogin (@joshrogin) October 5, 2016Pence says Trump has built a business through hard times and good times. Kaine keeps interjecting, talking about how Trump loves Russia and mentioning that Trump didn't pay taxes.Pence fires back to Kaine: ""You and Sec. Clinton would know a lot about an insult driven campaign.""-- Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) October 5, 20169:10: Kaine is asked why voters distrust Clinton and why he trusts her. She mentions Clinton's email scandal and the Clinton Foundation. Repeating lines from his announcement speech, Kaine talks about Clinton having a passion about something before they went into public service. He then pivots to attacking Trump about his comments about ""Mexican immigrants."" He spends more time attacking Trump than defending Clinton's honesty.Kaine: ""I can't imagine how Gov Pence can defend the insult driven, selfish-me first style of Donald Trump""-- Jamie Dupree (@jamiedupree) October 5, 20169:08: Pence says America has weakened in the last seven years. He cites the war on coal and failed health care reform. Pence says he wants to thank Trump for making the call and inviting him to be on the ticket. Pence says he grew up in a small town in a town not dissimilar from Farmville. Pence says if the responsibility ever fell to him, he would meet it with the responsibility should he be elected vice president. Pence says he has a lifetime of experience of growing up in a small town, serving in Congress, and leading Indiana. He says he would pray that he would be able to meet the challenge with the lifetime of experience .9:06: The first topic is ""presidential leadership."" Both are asked why they are equipped to take over the presidency should a tragedy happen. Kaine talks about the civil rights history of Farmville. He says he's proud to be running with a ""history-making woman"" in Hillary Clinton. He's repeating campaign talking points and says Clinton asked him to be her running mate because the test is whether to make people's lives better. He says Clinton cited his extensive lifelong career in the government and Kaine says that's what he brings to the ticket. He says his primary role is to be Clinton's right hand man. Kaine says he trusts Clinton to be commander-in-chief but the thought of Trump as Commander-in-Chief scares him to death. Kaine keeps saying ""trust.""9:05: Messrs. Pence and Kaine take their seats, and the debate is about to begin.9:03:Fun fact: I took Elaine Quijano's sister to the freshman homecoming dance at Niles North High School #VPDebate-- Joel B.

The two candidates will be seated at a table, which will make it a bit more difficult to land attacks.8:45: Trump blasts CNN.Wow, @CNN is so negative. Their panel is a joke, biased and very dumb. I'm turning to @FoxNews where we get a fair shake! Mike will do great-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 20168:35: Debate Commission officials now addressing the audience. They tell the audience that the debate will be divided into 9 segments. Each will last 10 minutes. They also ask for no ""hooting' and hollerin'"" during he debate.8:25: Pence arrives:Republican nominee for vice president Mike Pence arrives at the #VPDebate.

But Pence still has a huge opportunity to make the case against Clinton. But Trump's performance last week was more disappointing because all eyes were on the debate and Trump had a chance to inform voters who were starting to pay attention to the election about the Clinton Foundation scandals, Clinton's dishonestly, Clinton's failures re: Benghazi. He never told voters that Clinton favors admitting more Syrian refugees who cannot be properly vetted.VP debate ratings over the years: (h/t @tvnewser) Biden-Palin '08 holds the record with 69.9 million total viewers #CanICallYouJoe pic.twitter.com/3UVvLxQosk-- Jordan J Frasier (@jordanjfrasier) October 4, 2016He also never bothered to, before a record audience, make the case that he is for Americanism while Clinton is for the globalists. He never bothered to bring up illegal immigration or point out that Clinton endangered the country's national security with her private email server. Pence can hammer those points tonight, but there will not be as nearly as many people who will be watching tonight's debate.Clinton on what she learned from her first debate: ""I learned that preparation is important""-- Abby D. Phillip (@abbydphillip) October 4, 20166:10: Trump will be live-Tweeting the debate. He should take some lessons from Minnesota Vikings cornerback Xavier Rhodes about not taking the bait. After the Vikings defeated the New York Giants last night, ESPN hosts tried to get Rhodes to speak badly about Odell Beckham Jr. and potentially give Houston wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins (next week's opponent) some bulletin board material. Rhodes handled the interview smoothly like a professional, not taking the bait like an amateur. Here's hoping Trump has learned not to be so easily baited like Beckham Jr. He owes that to his supporters.I will be watching the great Governor @Mike_Pence and live tweeting the VP debate tonight starting at 8:30pm est!

Stop running as if the mainstream media are on your side.Clinton on Trump's PTS comments: ""Donald Trump's comments are not only ignorant, they are harmful because they give voice to the stigma.""-- Dan Merica (@danmericaCNN) October 4, 20166:00: Hillary Clinton faced the press and reporters again set her up with mostly favorable questions. She was asked about a Republican who attended her rally today, which gave Clinton another opportunity to repeat her talking points about appealing to Republicans (how convenient). She was asked about Tim Kaine, and she said she was ""confident and excited"" about tonight's debate. She said Pence has a ""huge burden"" because he has to defend his record and Donald Trump. When asked about whether she wanted to drone Julian Assange, Clinton lawyerly and unconvincingly claimed, ""I don't recall any joke."" And she insisted that had she made a joke about droning Assange, that ""it would have been a joke."" No follow-up questions on the matter.5:55: At his Arizona rally, Trump, seizing on Bill Clinton's comments about Obamacare, said Bill Clinton must have ""went through hell last night.""""Can you imagine what he went through after he made that statement?"" Trump said. He then added, ""there have been many nights when he's gone through hell with Hillary, in all fairness.""There have been many nights when he's gone through hell with Hillary, in all fairness.Bottom line: Clinton stopped Trump's momentum by winning the debate. Pence tonight halted Clinton-Kaine momentum. See you Sunday night.
