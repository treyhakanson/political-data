C'mon, man: most Americans will find that news reassuring, not alarming.
Why anyone should be surprised at Clinton's support among top corporate leaders is a mystery.The party of Big Government will always have good friends in Big Business, especially in those industries highly dependent on continued government largesse.Yet, apparently, the major media believe their own propaganda, that the Republican party is the party of big business, which is a myth that expired at least two generations ago.Anyone half awake knows that for decades, Big Business has been playing both sides, giving money and endorsements to the party they think will win. ""Access"" is the name of the game, and it has nothing to do with business principles but a lot to do with corporate interests.Crony capitalists are expert at buying access because that's the key to corporate profits in an economy highly dependent on government spending.Do you think Safeway wants to see a cut in food stamps? Does WalMart want to see high tariffs on Chinese goods? Are the big banks who have survived Dodd-Franks going to welcome with open arms new policies to encourage a revival of healthy, thriving community banks? Does Big Agriculture welcome a cut in ethanol subsidies to corn growers?The answers to those questions are no, no, and hell no. So, it's not news that very few CEOs in those industries are supporting Donald Trump. We should see corporate America's opposition to Trump as a sign of hope: Did we expect crony capitalism to be defanged and defunded without resistance?To be sure, not every successful business leader is a crony capitalist, dependent on access to friends in government to help get that next government contract. And let's admit that the term as it is used today lacks precision. The term is often used by the left to denigrate and smear all business success.The problem is that our economy has become so intertwined with government that it is often hard to separate the two. The question is, do we want more of that ""business-government partnership"" or less? Crony capitalists want more, a lot more.Much of corporate America's fear of Donald Trump is based on the uncertainty created by talk of cutting those intimate ties. Many corporate CEO's worry that Trump might be serious about dismantling the federal regulatory apparatus that today absorbs over $2.1 trillion in compliance costs.If you've ever been a candidate for public office, you have probably had a personal experience with the network of corporate political action committees and semi-secret groups that try to influence elections- and not always on the side of taxpayer protections. In the 2014 gubernatorial race in Colorado, a cabal of business leaders arranged for a sizeable amount of laundered out-of-state money to purchase radio advertising attacking my candidacy.More recently, a group led by a former Republican Governor funded primary election challenges to incumbent Republican legislators who had dared to rock the boat -- they called it ""grandstanding""- in ways they disapproved. Oddly, they did not fund challenges to a single incumbent Democrat legislator.Many of those same corporate leaders are found among the backers of Hillary Clinton's White House bid. While we think such support for the progressive Democrat agenda is shameful, we should not be surprised by it. Crony capitalism is notoriously nonpartisan and bipartisan, and that is why it is so entrenched and so powerful.The Trump candidacy is a frontal assault on the crony capitalism that has led us into a no-growth economy, a $19 trillion national debt, the blind export of millions of middle-class jobs, and an addiction to deficit spending that extends to state governments as well as the federal octopus.Are you one of the hundred million Americans who thinks, ""Thank goodness my state constitution requires a balanced budget- my state is not in the mess we see in the federal budget!""Well, my friend, take a closer look at your state budget. What percentage of total state spending comes from ""federal dollars""? That budget number will be staggering.In fact, you may have one or two state agencies funded 90 percent  or more by federal tax dollars. States are becoming mere administrative units of the federal bureaucracy- in health care, energy, transportation, education and more.Now, ask yourself: Is the typical Fortune 500 CEO or ""Colorado 100"" or ""Connecticut 100"" CEO losing any sleep over the fiscal mess we are in? No? Should we trust the country's future and our grandchildren's freedom to the candidates they endorse?Crony capitalism is as economically insidious as it is morally abhorrent. It will not be derailed and defeated by Chamber of Commerce complacency or coalitions of multimillionaires whose children are protected by a safety net called a trust fund.Our nation's destiny is not the property of the crony capitalists; it is not theirs to sell or trade in the ""global marketplace."" It belongs to us, the American people- sometimes known as the American electorate.Donald Trump is far from the perfect candidate, and as a businessman, he has at times engaged in business practices required by the corporate culture he inherited. But a man is known by both his friends and the enemies he makes, and in 2016, Trump has made exactly the right kind of enemies.I for one am thankful that those Fortune 500 and Colorado Chamber of Commerce crony capitalists take him seriously enough to publicly oppose him.SIGN UP"

Bernie Sanders (I-VT), saying they've bought into a ""false promise.""SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""It's a false promise,"" Clinton says in the recording, referencing Sanders' political revolution. ""But I don't think you tell idealistic people -- particularly young people -- that they've bought into a false promise.""The audio, which was released by the Washington Free Beacon, comes just three weeks after Clinton faced backlash for calling millions of Americans supporting Donald Trump ""deplorables.""The recording, which is from a fundraising event in February, catches the Democratic nominee calling Sanders' supporters ""children of the Great Recession"" that are ""living in their parents' basement.""""There is a strain of, on the one hand, the kind of populist, nationalist, xenophobic, discriminatory kind of approach that we hear too much of from the Republican candidates,"" Clinton states.She continues:And on the other side, there's just a deep desire to believe that we can have free college, free healthcare, that what we've done hasn't gone far enough, and that we just need to, you know, go as far as, you know, Scandinavia, whatever that means, and half the people don't know what that means, but it's something that they deeply feel.""Some are new to politics completely. They're children of the Great Recession. And they are living in their parents' basement,"" Clinton adds. ""They feel they got their education and the jobs that are available to them are not at all what they envisioned for themselves. And they don't see much of a future.""She continues, ""If you're feeling like you're consigned to, you know, being a barista, or you know, some other job that doesn't pay a lot, and doesn't have some other ladder of opportunity attached to it, then the idea that maybe, just maybe, you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing.""The audio, which the Washington Free Beacon reports was ""revealed by hackers who breached the email account of a campaign staffer,"" is making headlines after Sanders hit the campaign trail in New Hampshire on Wednesday to woo millennial voters for Clinton.And on the other side, there's just a deep desire to believe that we can have free college, free healthcare, that what we've done hasn't gone far enough, and that we just need to, you know, go as far as, you know, Scandinavia, whatever that means, and half the people don't know what that means, but it's something that they deeply feel.SIGN UP"

Jerry Brown Signs Bill Criminalizing Journalists Who Distribute Recordings of Abortion Providers	"A bill sponsored by Planned Parenthood that criminalizes the distribution of recordings of conversations with abortion providers is now law in California.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERGov. Jerry Brown signed Assembly Bill 1671 into law, making it illegal for journalists to distribute audio or video recordings of healthcare providers without their consent.As the Los Angeles Times reports, Planned Parenthood pushed the bill through the legislature even though it is already illegal to make these types of recordings without authorization in California. The abortion business argued that further punishment was needed for distributing the materials.Spearheaded by Assemblyman Jimmy Gomez (D-Los Angeles), the new law comes as Planned Parenthood is desperately attempting to suppress information regarding its ""baby parts"" scandal. Last year, undercover journalists from the Center for Medical Progress (CMP) released a series of videos exposing Planned Parenthood's alleged practices of exchanging the tissues of babies it aborts for monetary consideration and altering the position of babies during abortion to maximize the chance of harvesting intact organs.Opponents of the bill have expressed concern about its potential to violate the First Amendment rights of the press and to obstruct journalists' job of providing information that is in the best interests of the public. In the case of Planned Parenthood - which receives more than half-a-billion dollars in taxpayer funds - it is in the interest of taxpayers to know if their money is spent on potentially criminal behavior, such as the sale of body parts of aborted babies for profit.""The Center for Medical Progress never recorded 'confidential' communications, so California's existing recording law and the new distribution provision are simply inapplicable to our work,"" says CMP project lead David Daleiden about the new law. He added:However, it is clear that Planned Parenthood does not want to be held accountable to the public whose taxpayer money it gladly takes by the hundreds of millions, and will even attack freedom of speech and the freedom of the press in order to maintain its own arbitrary levels of secrecy.While Planned Parenthood has denied any wrongdoing in the baby organ scandal, its president, Cecile Richards, also released a statement last October, announcing it will no longer accept payments for aborted fetal tissue. The narrative put forward at that point was that the videos produced by CMP were ""deceptively edited.""Nevertheless, a Democrat opposition research firm named Fusion, hired by Planned Parenthood itself to review the videos, said that while its staff observed the videos had been edited - as most videos are - ""the analysis did not reveal widespread evidence of substantive video manipulation.""Additionally, Fusion noted, ""Analysts found no evidence that CMP inserted dialogue not spoken by Planned Parenthood staff.""An analysis by Coalfire, a third-party forensics company hired by Alliance Defending Freedom, found that the videos were ""not manipulated"" and that they are ""authentic.""However, it is clear that Planned Parenthood does not want to be held accountable to the public whose taxpayer money it gladly takes by the hundreds of millions, and will even attack freedom of speech and the freedom of the press in order to maintain its own arbitrary levels of secrecy.SIGN UP"

Jeff Sessions is going after a top immigration official who earlier admitted the U.S. government has invited future terrorists into American communities, the Obama administration's much-touted ""vetting process"" aside.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""The fact is--anybody that understands the challenge they face to do this vetting. You cannot vet people from Syria, because there's no way, and we have no plans to send anybody into Syria to verify anything that they say,"" Sessions told Leon Rodriguez during his testimony before a Senate panel.""That's the problem, fundamentally,"" the Republican continued. ""Are you not aware that I have written four letters to the Department, asking for information on how many refugees have been convicted of criminal and terrorist activities?""Rodriguez, who directs citizenship and immigration Services for the Department of Homeland Security, said he wasn't. ""I confess Chairman, I am not. I will certainly make sure to follow up on those correspondence--""""This is absolutely breathtaking,"" Sessions cut in. ""It is a total disrespect to this body, who is in charge of giving you money to run your business. We should quit giving you money if you don't respond and you don't know basic things.""Sessions, who who chairs the Senate's Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, listed the letters he sent to the Department of Homeland Security, along with one sent directly to the president demanding to know how many refugees were convicted on criminal or terrorism charges in the U.S. ""So do you think we're entitled to know this?"" he asked.""I will--of course you're entitled to answers to your questions. I will follow up, sir,"" Rodriguez said.""Well, to me, it indicates the determination to promote an agenda without listening to the American people, without listening to their elected representatives, and to downplay and to misrepresent, really, the danger that this program presents,"" Sessions said. ""And we're not having terrorists from a lot of areas, but some areas we're having terrorists that threaten this country in a whole lot of ways.""Sessions added that he had sent the letters to Department of Homeland Security secretary Jeh Johnson, and would take it as an ""absolute refusal"" to respond to legitimate requests to Congress if no one in the department brought them to Johnson's or Rodriguez's attention.Rodriguez also tried to clarify ""our operations are fee-funded, not tax-funded. They're not funded by the taxpayers.""""So you're not funded by the taxpayers. And so you don't have any responsibility to the taxpayers?"" the Alabama senator asked.""No, we have a responsibility to the taxpayers,"" Rodriguez backtracked, ""and the American people to do our job the right way. That's not the point I was making.""""You don't get any fees that Congress hasn't authorized, isn't that true?"" Sessions asked.""That's certainly true,"" Rodriguez admitted.Sessions' office found in June that of the 580 people convicted of terrorism-related offenses between September 11, 2001, and December 31, 2014--which does not include the terrorist Muslims who carried the 9/11 attacks--380 were foreign-born, with 24 of those brought in as refugees.Adding to the Department of Homeland Security's immigration scandals, an audit revealed over 1,811 aliens from terrorist countries under final deportation orders were granted U.S. citizenship--giving them the right to vote and gain security clearances--with the Obama administration shutting down the program that uncovered the rampant fraud.Another Obama administration official refused to say how many Syrian refugees specifically the government plans to ship to American neighborhoods. The outgoing Obama administration wants to ship 110,000 refugees altogether to the U.S. in fiscal year 2017, which begins October 1.SIGN UP"

Already in his groundbreaking 1977 book, Psychology as Religion: The Cult of self-Worship, Dr. Paul C. Vitz offered a stinging critique of the selfism that is central to the most popular psychological schools. The narcissism described by Vitz has reached its apex in the millennial generation, and thoughtful observers will find it unsurprising that many millennials would find psychological therapy to be a natural surrogate for religious faith.In his book, Vitz argued that contemporary psychology ""is a form of secular humanism based on the rejection of God and the worship of the self,"" which is perfectly suited to the least religious generation in American history.Drawing on statistics from recent studies, King notes that millennials ""are less religious than other generations."" While a quarter of people born between 1981 and 1996 identify as nonbelievers, ""just 16% percent of Generation X identifies as nonbelievers, and only 11% of Baby Boomers.""One in twenty millennials call themselves atheists, whereas 7 percent identify as agnostic and 13 percent identify as ""nothing"" or ""nones,"" making this the least religious generation in United States history.That's where therapy steps in.King's analysis of the inherent compatibility between psychological therapy and the predominant selfism of millennials rings remarkably similar to Vitz's critique, though she seems to find nothing wrong with the egotism at the core of her generational milieu.Therapy has ""unique millennial appeal,"" King contends, precisely because ""whereas religion tends to focus on communal worship, therapy is far more focused on the self.""Since millennials ""tend to be more individualistic than other generations,"" therapy focusing on the needs and desires of the individual dovetails perfectly with the millennial character, she suggests.""The fact that the therapeutic space is designed for self-discovery and thinking through its use of open-ended questions fits these needs perfectly,"" she says. Ultimately, committing to therapy ""is an act of faith.""In fact, for King and her fellow atheist millennials, the only drawback to therapy as a replacement for religion is the economic cost. While church services and even one-on-one mentoring with a pastor are offered free of charge, the cost of ongoing therapy ""constitutes a significant obstacle for many young people,"" King says.Therapy is often able to stroke the ego of patients while making no real moral demands on them. For $100 an hour, clients can be reinforced in their belief that the universe revolves around them and that all their problems are somebody else's fault.For a generation that is uniquely focused on itself and its own concerns, that may be a small price to pay.Follow Thomas D.

Susan McGrath, head of the Democratic party of Pinellas Country and also the leader of the Stonewall Democrats, sees this move by Clarke as partisan. McGrath compared Clarke's voter registration to the Democratic Supervisor of Elections holding a voter registration drive at Planned Parenthood. Highlighting the lack of transparency on the part of Clarke, McGrath pointed out that she [Clarke] would have been more transparent if she held the voter registration drive at the Republican Party Headquarters.McGrath pointed out that earlier this month, Clarke refused to open up satellite offices for early voting in certain areas of St Petersburg south of Central Avenue that have high numbers of black voters. The opening of these offices would have improved voter registration among black Americans in Pinellas County. McGrath sees the Chick-fil-A voter registration event as a way to register higher numbers of Republican voters because they represent a large number of Chick-fil-A's consumer base.The Tampa Bay Times went on to report that McGrath wrote to Clarke and said, ""While some Democrats may occasionally dine at Chick-fil-A (and perhaps even members of the LGBT community), the coordination of Pinellas voter registration activities with this right-leaning business very clearly conveys that your office is targeting Republican-leaning voters."" Chic-fil-A is well known for their strong Conservative Christian values and even for putting their values before profits.A spokesman for Deborah Clarke, Jason Latimer, told the Tampa Bay Times, ""the office will hold 350 voter drives this year."" He declined to comment on McGrath's allegations, but he did say the restaurants draw lots of customers.SIGN UP"

She said he later dropped her off at her home and demanded she not tell anyone of the incident.That didn't keep the teenager from telling her sister at the time. The girl's mother was not made aware of the incident until months later and that's when she alerted authorities.Gonzales reportedly told police he never raped the girl, but following his arrest, a 50 year-old woman told police she experienced a sexual assault with the illegal immigrant as well.The woman said Gonzales grabbed her hand and put it on the crotch of his pants in the summer of last year. Like the rape, he has denied the incident.ICE officials told Breitbart Texas they had requested that local law enforcement notify them before releasing the illegal immigrant.""ICE is focused on smart, effective immigration enforcement that prioritizes the removal of criminal aliens and other individuals who pose a threat to national security, public safety and border security,"" a spokesman for ICE told Breitbart Texas.

At 12:50 a.m., she cast her solemn vote to invade Iraq after what she insists was careful and meticulous consideration. It wasn't just an off-hand question.Mrs. Clinton's vote had the force of law to authorize the Iraq invasion.In a long, detailed speech on the Senate floor hours earlier, Mrs. Clinton said she cast her vote for authorizing war ""with conviction.""As a result of Mrs. Clinton's vote to go to war, 4,424 American troops died -- fighting for her ""conviction.""

Kevin P. Brady (R.-Texas). ""Can you imagine that? Having to sell off most of your land, just to keep it from the government, just to save the house,"" he said.""There are two new major threats to family-owned farms and businesses right now,"" said Brady, who succeeded Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R.-Wis.) as the committee chairman when Ryan became the Speaker.""Number one is Hillary Clinton's proposal to raise the death tax rate to 65 percent, which would be the highest rate since the 1980s,"" he said. ""At that point, you're confiscating property and land and businesses,"" he said.""The other threat is the Obama administration's Treasury Department rules that came put in August."" The new rules, called ""valuation rules,"" impose higher tax liabilities onto families trying to pass their businesses to family members, he said. It is as if the IRS decided to raise taxes on its own, he said.Prior to the new rules, the IRS accepted that most farms and businesses are relatively illiquid. A family-owned restaurant might be worth $12 million, based on the book value of its tangible assets, cash flow and good will, but unlike a stock, it is difficult to convert the ongoing business into cash quickly, especially if it is held in a family partnership or family corporation.Often these businesses partnerships have restrictions or covenants, such as two brothers with equal shares, but one cannot sellout without permission from the other.  This difficulty in getting liquid means the restaurant, or farm or dry cleaners, is actually worth less than its valuation. The new IRS rules no longer accounts for this illiquidity when valuing the value of the business for the purposes of assessing the tax.Estates valued more than $5.45 million are taxed at 40 percent of their excess more than the threshold. Putting aside other factors, if a person died with a $8 million ranch, the family would have pay the IRS $1.2 million, whether they keep the ranch or not.The rules also curtail the ability of individuals to gift property to family members during their lifetime without it becoming a taxable event.The IRS released the proposed rules Aug. 2 and will receive comments until Nov. 2. The agency will hold a hearing Dec. 1 before the final rules that would be effective Jan. 1. ""We think it is wrong and a major overreach,"" Brady said.The chairman said his office and the committee have received complaints from families around the country about the new rules, including petitions and letters with hundreds of signatures.The Texan said Ryan supports full repeal, too. ""He's all in. He's from Wisconsin.""Ryan, then the committee chairman, worked with Brady to bring the measure to the House floor April 16, 2015 when, it passed 240-179, the congressman said. The companion bill in the Senate is sponsored by Sen. John R. Thune (R.-S.D.).In was the first House floor vote to abolish the death tax in 10 years, he said.Brady is an intense force charging in the hallways of the Capitol. He has the hands of a workman and his eyes lock onto their target. Although, he holds one of the most storied and powerful chairmanships on Capitol Hill with jurisdiction over taxes, spending and banking, as well as other matters,  he spends a lot of his time in his constituency office, rather than the chairman's chambers.Brady is a man who never forgets his own family's struggles after his father died. It is an attitude he puts in practice by never wearing his Member of Congress lapel pin. The absent pin means he forgoes the everyday courtesies of his office and he can see how staffers and other people around the Capitol treat someone, who they don't know is a congressman.His father died when he was 12, which is part of his bond with Ryan, who lost his father with he was in high school.But, more importantly, Brady saw at an early age how life for his mother and his four siblings changed forever with that one event- and how it changes for others, too.Brady said the death tax is the number one reason why family farms and businesses are not passed down to the next generation.Now as women and minority businesses become more common, new people are becoming exposed to the confiscatory practice of taxes estates, he said. ""They thought it was for the wealthy, but now they are discovering, uh-oh, it's their nest egg they're coming after.""""We got a family in our district and they are taking out their third 'Death Tax' loan,"" he said. ""Grandfather, father and spouse, just to keep the same land they've had for generations,"" he said.""We have another one-one of our former staffers here-she went back home to settle her aunt's estate in Texas and I think she and her brother had to sell the bulk of her family's property, and they've had it since the 1880s,"" he said.Brady told Breitbart News he did not grow up in a wealthy family, so he did not understand the death tax and its impact until 1997, his first year in Congress. The moment came when a couple from his district came up to him and sketched out what the death tax had in store for them, their children and their nursery business.The couple took out a piece of paper and sketched it out for him. ""Just on a piece of paper, they wrote down how they had no debt, two or three kids were running the business and they basically showed me that if they could have enough money in life insurance and could go to the bank to borrow the money, they could keep their family business,"" the chairman said.The idea the family would have to exhaust its life insurance and then go into debt, just to keep its business going after paying off the death tax, he said, is ""un-American, immoral and wrong.""SIGN UP"

At issue was a video Harvey made to emphasize the fact that criminals do not follow laws, therefore, more gun control only constrains law-abiding citizens.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe video was discovered on a thumb-drive Harvey accidentally left in a school library computer. It shows that criminals get guns illegally-regardless of the law-and he contrasted this with stories that highlight law-abiding citizens' need to be able to keep and bear arms for defense of themselves and their families.The video also mocks the idea that ""liberals"" pretend criminals are hindered by ""gun free zone"" signage.Harvey's video tells the story of a criminal who acquired his gun illegally and was later ""convicted of murder in the first degree."" Text in the video says:We can establish that because criminals do not follow laws they therefore would be able to obtain a gun even if laws were established to prevent law-abiding citizens from obtaining guns. Preventing law-abiding citizens from obtaining guns only makes [the criminal's] ""job"" easier, as the law-abiding citizens are now unable to protect themselves from criminals who obtain guns illegally anyway.He tells the story of ""a father in Texas who was well-prepared to defend his home"" when three home invaders struck in July 2013. The father ""[sent] two of them to thief heaven after the fatal mistake of breaking into the wrong home.""Harvey observes, ""So, who is the real insane one here?

As the Wall Street Journal's Kimberly Strassel notes in a column on Friday, the deception ought to have earned Mills a prosecution for perjury -- and a deeper probe of Hillary Clinton -- but the FBI chose to look the other way.Not only did Mills receive immunity from the Department of Justice, but she was also allowed to sit in on the FBI's interview with Clinton -- and to walk out of her own interview with the FBI when she was asked questions about the email scandal that she decided she did not have to answer.Central to Mills's apparent super-immunity is her assertion of attorney-client privilege. The privilege, which can only be waived by the client, prevents an attorney from disclosing any communications from his or her client. Mills asserted that she did not have to tell the FBI about the server because she only learned about it once she was Clinton's attorney -- i.e. after she left the State Department, where she had been a ""counselor"" and chief of staff but did not represent Clinton personally.The only way to square these contradictory facts is to believe the incredibly unlikely theory that Mills knew about the server when she was at the State Department, but forgot about it when she left, then was reminded about it by Clinton once she was her attorney, but could not talk about it without permission from Clinton at that stage, thanks to the attorney-client privilege she conveniently enjoyed.It is not the first time Mills has been linked to a cover-up. In 2013, a State Department diplomat who had been in Libya during the Benghazi attacks told Congress that Mills had instructed witnesses not to cooperate with Congress. She is also alleged to have interfered with other investigations.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

The memo continues:During his stay in Honduras, Kaine openly embraced liberation theology, a controversial political ideology cloaked in Catholic teaching, but radically at odds with the Catholic Church and with the United States. At the time, this extremist ideology was adopted by activists and even some clergy who were openly hostile to the Church, the Pope, and the United States. The Marxist elements of this ideology were condemned by the Vatican in the 1980's and 1990's. During his time in Latin America, Kaine was surrounded by radicals and their influences took root in the version of Christianity he adopted. According to the New York Times, it was this theology that set him on a ""left-veering career path"" influencing his politics to the present day.The memo recounts Kaine's relationship in Honduras with radical liberation theology proponent Father James Carney, who accepted ""armed rebellion, socialism, Marxism, and communism"" as part of God's plan for political and social change. Prior to his death as a member of the Sandinista rebel army, Carney helped found socialist broadcast outlet Radio Progresso.Kaine continues to be in touch with Carney's successor, Father Ismael Moreno Coto (Father Melo), and announced in a press release in November of 2014 that he met with the Jesuit priest.""I think of El Progreso every day,"" Kaine said. ""The people, aside from my family, are the most important in shaping who I am today.""Though he touts his ""Catholic"" faith, Kaine has consistently voted in favor of abortion rights, and recently told LGBT activists that the Catholic Church's opposition to same-sex marriage would eventually change since God sees all of Creation as ""very good,"" including homosexuality.In its memo, CatholicVote says, ""Pope John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI, and Pope Francis have all opposed the radical Marxist nature of liberation theology.""""In 2005, Pope Francis (then Cardinal Bergoglio) noted that 'liberation theology' and 'Christian Socialism' (Carney's preferred category) had survived by 'inertia' even if some 'anachronistically' want to resurrect it,"" the memo continues. ""Perhaps most succinctly, Pope Benedict called it the theology of 'Barabbas' as opposed to that of Jesus Christ.""During his stay in Honduras, Kaine openly embraced liberation theology, a controversial political ideology cloaked in Catholic teaching, but radically at odds with the Catholic Church and with the United States.

His action follows the rejection of a proposal announced previously where Texas officials demanded a certification that the refugees were not a security threat and a limit on the number of refugees to the original 2016 plan.""Texas has repeatedly requested that the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Director of National Intelligence provide assurances that refugees resettled in Texas will not pose a security threat, and that the number of refugees resettled in Texas would not exceed the State's original allocation in fiscal year 2016 - both of which have been denied by the federal government,"" Abbott said in a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. ""As a result, Texas will withdraw from the refugee resettlement program. As governor, I will continue to prioritize the safety of all Texans and urge the federal government to overhaul this severely broken system.""THHSC Spokesman Bryan Bryan Black told Breitbart Texas on Friday afternoon, ""Since we have not received federal approval of our plan, we are moving forward with our transition out of the Refugee Resettlement Program. After today, the current plan will no longer be in effect, and we will begin exiting the program, with benefits and services ending on Jan. 31, 2017.""THHSC sent a letter to the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement detailing the State's concerns, Breitbart Texas reported on September 21. That letter states:In follow up to our request for approval of our application for an amended State Plan, I write to express the state of Texas' intentions should you not unconditionally approve our application by September 30, 2016.The 2016 State Plan will no longer be current and continue in effect after September 30, 2016.

We will notify contractors and impacted stakeholders that services and benefits will be provided for 120 days beyond October 1, 2016, or until January' 31, 2017.These requests were rejected by the federal government, the governor's office stated.Governor Abbott previously said the federal refugee resettlement plan is riddled with serious problems that create threats to the country. Breitbart Texas previously reported on testimony before Congress from some of the President's top security advisors. The officials stated they believe that terrorists would attempt to infiltrate the refugee resettlement program.""We have certainly seen terrorist groups talk about, think about, exactly what you are describing, Mr. Smith,"" Director of the National Counterterrorism Center Nicholas J. Rasmussen told Rep. Lamar Smith. ""Trying to use available programs to get people not only into the United States, but into western European countries as well. So we know that they aspire to do that."" This testimony was made prior to the terrorist attacks in Paris where at least one Syrian refugee was involved, according to an article by Breitbart London.Earlier this month, House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mike McCaul reiterated that there is currently no way to properly vet Syrian refugees. His comments came in Houston during a meeting of the Downtown Houston Pachyderm Club, as reported by Breitbart Texas.""If there is no data to check, there is no data to check,"" McCaul said at the Thursday lunch meeting of local Republican activists. The chairman said he arrived at this conclusion after talking with some of the top security officials in the country.Texas is leading the United States in refugee resettlement, Breitbart Texas reported earlier this year.
