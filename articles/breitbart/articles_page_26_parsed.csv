The African nations have challenged the legality of the appointment, asking that his mandate be put on hold.Muntarbhorn has been tasked with assessing implementations of existing international human rights law, identifying best practices and gaps, and raising awareness of violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI). Critics suggest that his very mandate will constitute interference with the laws of many UN countries.Seventy three countries worldwide, and almost 40 percent of all UN member states, have anti-sodomy laws on their books. In Africa alone, 33 states have laws making homosexual acts a crime, including Uganda, Nigeria, Sudan and Mauritania.Speaking on behalf of the African countries, Botswana's ambassador told a General Assembly human rights committee Friday that African nations ""are alarmed"" that the Human Rights Council is delving into national matters and attempting to focus on people ""on the grounds of their sexual interests and behaviors.""Ambassador Charles Ntwaagae said that the Council had no business looking into ""sexual orientation and gender identity,"" which are notoriously absent from the United Nations charter document, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.""Those two notions are not and should not be linked to existing international human rights instruments,"" said Ntwaagae. The UN has never adopted an official position regarding putative rights of gender identity or sexual orientation, though it does guarantee the rights of life, liberty, security, property and equal protection to all persons without distinction.""We therefore call for the suspension of the activities of the appointed independent expert pending the determination of this issue,"" said Ntwaagae.The Africa group claimed that a focus on homosexual rights also takes attention away from other issues of ""paramount importance,"" such as racism and the right to development.The draft resolution questioning the legality of Muntarbhorn's mandate will be put to a vote on Tuesday. If adopted it would then need to be voted upon later this year by the General Assembly.African leaders have often complained of attempts by Western nations to impose their values on other countries, accusing them of ""cultural imperialism.""When President Barack Obama visited Africa in 2015, he made the LGBT agenda one of the centerpieces of his message, comparing discrimination of gays in Africa to the treatment of blacks in America prior to the civil rights movement.""As an African American in the United States I am painfully aware of what happens when people are treated differently under the law,"" the president said.According to an article in the New York Times, however, Obama's full-court press for homosexual rights in Africa backfired, resulting in increased hostility toward gays rather than greater acceptance.Immediately after his visit, a number of Africa's political and religious leaders lashed out at the president, requesting that he learn to respect Africa's values rather than imposing his own.""In the same way that we don't try to impose our culture on anyone, we also expect that people should respect our culture in return,"" said Theresa Okafor, a Nigerian activist.Cardinal John Onaiyekan, the Catholic Archbishop of Abuja Diocese in Nigeria, said that the position of Catholics against homosexual behavior is irrevocable and that the Church will continue to maintain its stand against gay marriage.""Unfortunately, we are living in a world where these things have now become quite acceptable but for the fact that they are acceptable doesn't mean that they are right,"" he said. ""The Catholic Church considers itself as carrying the banner of the truth in the world that has allowed itself to be so badly deceived.""Follow Thomas D.

This election offers a fundamental choice: between staying on the current path of decline, or taking a better way that offers more freedom for every single American.

Only Republicans are offering a better way. A unified Republican government will dedicate itself to reclaiming our founding principles and solving the country's problems. This is not just a vague promise -- we have put on paper the details for how we will address the big challenges of the day. It's a six-point plan called ""A Better Way"":


1. Fight poverty by tying welfare to work and making sure it always pays for people to work and get on the ladder of opportunity.
2. Keep our country safe by securing the border, restoring our traditional alliances and rebuilding our military so we can confront radical Islamist extremism.
3. Grow the economy by developing our energy resources, ending bailouts and making unelected bureaucrats go through Congress for a final vote before regulations go into effect.

4. Restore the Constitution by restoring the separation of powers and setting higher standards for transparency and accountability.
5. Repeal Obamacare and all these skyrocketing premiums, so we can replace it with patient-centered solutions that empower you to pick the plan that meets your needs -- not Washington's mandates.
6. Fix our tax code and make it fairer and simpler -- so simple, in fact, that families can do their taxes on a form the size of a postcard.
This is our job as leaders: to offer positive solutions and empower people. Our duty is to tackle our problems before they tackle us.

Trump, changed his life.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""I was a young pro Puerto Rican boxer,"" Campudoni said in the short film, about five minutes long, as it opens over footage of him boxing on television. ""One of the originals the legendary Cus D'Amato took in. I worked and trained with the best: Tyson, Holyfield, and George Foreman.WATCH THE VIDEO OF WILLIAM CAMPUDONI'S ""AMERICAN COMEBACK STORY"":But before I could rise in boxing, someone gave me a chance like nobody else would.""Campudoni was struggling, having grown up ""very poor"" in Spanish Harlem in New York, when he stumbled one night into Trump Tower asking for a job after leaving St. Patrick's Cathedral.""My dresser was my crib. I was a victim of abuse in my own hometown ... in the streets,"" Campudoni said. ""At the age of 22, I was at the brink of being homeless. I remember one night on Christmas Eve, I walked into the St. Patrick's Cathedral, and I said, 'God, please give me a purpose.' As I exited, I walked down 5th Ave., and there was this gorgeous building.""Donald Trump himself hired Campudoni the next day.""I walked inside, and I said, 'I'm looking for work,'"" Campudoni said. ""The next day, Trump hired me off the streets. He gave me five navy blue suits. He shook my hand and said, 'Welcome to the family.'""Campudoni next told the story of the night Trump brought him a steak dinner when he was driving Trump to a meeting.""I remember the night I was assigned to drive Mr. Trump to a meeting,"" Campudoni stated. ""I dropped him off, and as he's getting out of the car, he said to me, 'Can I bring you a steak because I'm going to be there for quite a while?' Who am I for him to stop his meeting to bring me something to eat?""Campudoni said the ""accusations"" against Trump during the course of the campaign are simply not true. He asserted that Trump is a good man and looked out for everyone who worked for him.""You know, I hear these accusations, but let me tell you firsthand: he employed people from all origins,"" Campudoni said. ""We were all treated like family. And I remember that, and I admired him for that. He put us all first.""Campudoni talked in the next scene about a letter he got from Trump that kept him going throughout the hardest times of his life.""He once gave me a personal letter ... expressing just how proud he was of me,"" Campudoni shared. ""Later in life, pursuing my career, I got knocked out, in real life. ... I lost my way. Later, I also lost my wife to cancer, leaving me a single parent of two children, striving to be a role model. I suffered three heart-attacks, one stroke, and I was once pronounced dead in the ring. You know, Trump wouldn't know this ... but along with a few mementos in life, this letter was the one that gave me the most inspiration. These words, they have been a constant reminder of how much I have been appreciated.""The letters, provided to Breitbart News, include a letter from the director of security at Tiffany & Co. in Trump Tower, dated July 26, 1984, detailing an incident where a perpetrator smashed the display window--and Campudoni, on Trump's security detail, apprehended the suspect until police arrived. Trump himself wrote a follow-up letter to Campudoni, thanking him for his ""selfless"" efforts:Campudoni said that Trump was just as influential in his life as D'Amato--the man who trained him to be a professional boxer, just like he trained Mike Tyson, Jose Torres, Floyd Patterson, and other world famous fighters--because Trump taught him to act like a winner.""I never had a father, but I was so fortunate to come across thee two gentlemen: Cus D'Amato, who taught me how to be a fighter,"" Campudoni said. ""But Donald Trump ... taught me how to act like a champion. Mr. Trump just didn't give me a job that Christmas Day. What I realize today is that he gave me a tool to help rediscover my purpose ... to be an inspiration to my children.""The film was made by political filmmaker Lucas Baiano without the backing of any political action committee or major donors because he felt like the story needed to be told.""This is an American story, one that I felt inspired to produce. William represents a country currently on the ropes, looking for a way to make a comeback,"" Baiano, who, in 2008 worked for Hillary Clinton, but has since worked for the campaigns of Republicans, including Rick Perry, Tim Pawlenty, and John McCain, told Breitbart News. Baiano was profiled in 2012 for GQ magazine in the lead-up to the election. Baiano said that with all the paid ads from campaigns, Super PACs, and special interest groups in the lead-up to the election, he wanted to cut through the clutter with this video message that has a political and cultural significance, as well as the story of a true underdog who got a chance to succeed and inspire others to follow him--thanks to Trump's generosity.""William's story represents the country currently on the ropes, looking for a comeback,"" Baiano said.Noel Calubaquib, Baiano's associate producer, was the one who first met Campudoni, heard his story, and helped convince him to make this video to tell it. Calubaquib actually met Campudoni in an LA Fitness gym in Virginia, where they began talking about boxing, and where his life prior to boxing--where he worked for Trump--came up.""Meeting William and hearing his story felt serendipitous. He never anticipated sharing his story publicly like this, but once I heard it, I knew we needed to tell it,"" Calubaquib told Breitbart News.SIGN UP"	['Lucas', 'Trump']	[]
6	6	http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/11/05/exclusive-sen-scott-brown-donald-trump-surging-new-hampshire/	Exclusive — Sen. Scott Brown: Donald Trump Surging in New Hampshire	"NEW YORK CITY, New York -- Former U.S. Sen. Scott Brown, who ran in 2014 in New Hampshire after previously representing Massachusetts, told Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 that Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump is currently surging in New Hampshire.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""People wait until the last two or three or four or five days before they actually make a decision. That's no different in a statewide race or a national race like this,"" Brown said in an interview on Saturday morning. ""So you're seeing the polls, obviously, shift, plus with respect to Clinton--she's had a terrible three weeks. Every day it's something new and different and exciting and something that would put me, you, and every one of your listeners in jail. But because it's a Clinton, there's two sets of rules: one for them, and one for us. So--and then Trump has obviously been on message and he's been really, really doing well in terms of handling the messaging associated with what's happening with the FBI and what's happening with the pay-to-play.""A bevy of new polls from the Granite State show Trump tied or in the lead over his Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton. The latest Breitbart News/Gravis Marketing survey has Trump up two points over Clinton, and he's up five points in the latest ARG poll. He leads by one point in the latest WBUR poll and is tied in the latest Boston Globe and UMASS Lowell polls. New Hampshire, an all-important early primary state, is also a general election battleground with four precious electoral votes in the presidential race.Brown said part of the reason Trump is currently surging ahead of Clinton in New Hampshire is the lack of enthusiasm among many Democrats--especially millennials--for Clinton.""The millennials are not fired up with her like they were with Obama,"" Brown said. ""They don't like Hillary. A lot of them were Bernie supporters--and everything that is coming out about the DNC and what Hillary and her team did with Bernie, it really ticks them off. All the rhetoric--'Oh, you know, we're going to give you free tuition'--well, that doesn't help a lot of people in college who are actually there right now, and there's no way that because they recognize that when they're coming out they'll have to pay higher taxes and expenses. There's not a reality and so they're kind of onto the game that, 'Hey by the way, when we come out of college we're going to be $100,000 in debt, and we're not going to be able to get a job at McDonald's.' That's the problem for millennials. They're not enthused. And then they hear Donald Trump saying, 'You know what? We're going to create more jobs. We're going to lower corporate taxes. We're going to streamline the regulatory process. We're going to give you opportunities to go out there and do your own thing and make your own mark on this country.' And they're kind of like, 'Yeah, that sounds cool. I want to go do that.' That's why I voted for Ronald Reagan back when I was 18 years old because he was the president that said Republicans were the party of opportunity. 'You work your tail off, you can get ahead.'""Brown said Trump has solid support from veterans, law enforcement, and first responder communities, as well.""The veterans, the police, the fire, the EMTs, they're all going for Donald Trump, unless they're just so sucked into the Democratic Party they just can't wiggle, there's no wiggle room, because the veterans know he's going to put somebody strong in the VA who's going to take care of them so they don't have to fight for health care and jobs,"" Brown said. ""And then when it comes to improving our military, you look at Pease Air Force Base, which is now obviously a Guard base, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, the Bath Iron Works up in Maine, Hanscom in Massachusetts, they get it. The average mom-and-pop small businesses, they recognize that Obamacare is crushing them. I knew this would come up again. It is the number one issue, aside from our national security and our debt and deficit, I believe and always have believed. They're just dying, and they recognize that you can't keep your doctor, you can't keep your healthcare plan, you're not getting a $2,500 check--and, as a matter of fact, your deductibles are going sky high, your coverages are way down, the costs of the plans are going out of sight. On job growth, you're talking about part-time crappy jobs--that's what you're talking about--and people kind of get it. So those independents are coming out and they're saying, 'You know what? Let's take a shot. Yeah, he's kind of a nut--they don't really like how he's not smooth, he's not sophisticated, but he's going to surround himself with guys like Pence and others who are going to right the ship and give us a chance to kind of get on our own way and be a great country again.'""If Trump doesn't win, Brown argued, it would be in large part thanks to the GOP establishment organizations that have tried to undermine Trump from the get-go. Even so, Brown said, Trump has been able to get on message in the final weeks of the campaign--contributing to his surge in support despite intra-GOP efforts to ""sabotage"" him.""I know when I ran and when any Republican runs, they know what the Democrats are going to do--and MoveOn.org and Emily's List and [Liberal Billionaire Tom] Steyer and those groups--but they never expect that your own Republicans are going to come at you from behind and sabotage you like all the Super PACs and Never Trump people,"" Brown said. ""So, he's been basically on an island the whole time and is a lot of self-inflicted? Yeah, absolutely. He's made some terrible mistakes. He's not a politician, so you give him kind of a pass--but if he loses, it's on him because every time Hillary Clinton threw him a softball, he would be tweeting about Miss America instead of hammering that softball out of the park on the issue that she had given him. There were a lot of unbelievably missed opportunities not only in the debates, but after the debates. But for the last three weeks, he's actually focused and is firing on what he should have been for months and months. We as a party need to blame ourselves for not supporting the nominee with all his warts and problems because here's the thing: if you look at his mistakes and the things that he's got, and you compare them to her mistakes, her mistakes have cost people their lives in Benghazi and families their lives and livelihoods in Libya and our national security, potentially, as we're seeing now with the WikiLeaks. So what I tell people is, 'Hey, get rid of all the craziness and crazy stuff you hate about Donald Trump, and just throw that away. And then get all the stuff Hillary Clinton has actually done or being charged with, and throw that away. Then just focus on the issues: Who's in favor of sanctuary cities? Who's in favor of more regulation, higher taxes, more government into your life, more intervention into wars? It's Hillary Clinton. Who wants to end sanctuary cities, lower taxes, strengthen the border? It's Donald Trump.' If you just do it like that, then everything else just falls by the wayside, and you say, 'Man, I'm with Trump,' and that's what I think people are doing in New Hampshire and the rest of the country, as well.""Brown, however, warned of potential trickery by Democrats on Election Day: ""Every one of your listeners could go to New Hampshire today--or even Monday night--and stay at a hotel, stay at a friend's house, and then they could go in the next day without a license, without any ID whatsoever and say, 'Hi, I'd like to vote.' They'll say, 'Do have a license?' 'No.' 'Are you domiciled here?' 'Yes, I am domiciled here.' 'Do you have--have you voted today?' 'No, no, I haven't voted.' 'Well, all right, here's a one, two paragraph affidavit. You sign it, you can vote.' Well, what does 'domiciled' mean? 'Domiciled' means that you actually stayed at a hotel that night. Every effort that's been made by the legislature to provide at least a 30-day residency requirement so they don't bus the people in from Maine, Vermont, and Massachusetts has been stopped by the Democratic Governor Maggie Hassan. So that's why you actually have to have a Republican governor in there like Chris Sununu, who's actually going to change that law once and for all.""He said such actions would not be ""shenanigans"" because the law allows it--and that's why he'd like to see Trump surge more in New Hampshire in the final days just to be certain on Election Day.""It's not shenanigans. It's the law. You can do that,"" Brown said. ""So what they do is they not only do that; they go to the colleges, the Democrats--we did it at UNH and somewhat neutralized it. We didn't have the tools or resources to do it at the other colleges. But they basically go in and they say, 'Hey, get on the bus and go vote' because they're domiciled in their dorm which is in New Hampshire, and the law is so loose, so what the Democrats do is say, 'Hey, hey, we're having a party later! Come on and vote!' They kind of stroke and joke and give them pizza or give them gift certificates for food or whatever it is to get on the bus. Once they get them on the bus, they literally can bring in people with them, and they don't let anybody ask them any questions at all. They marshal them in. It's by the thousands. For me, it was 40,000--and for Romney it was upwards of 100,000. So that's why it's important to get a little bit more of a bump than tied or one or two percent. I'd feel more comfortable with three or four percent.""LISTEN TO FORMER SEN. SCOTT BROWN ON BREITBART NEWS SATURDAY:SIGN UP"	['Hassan', 'Romney', 'Pence', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	['healthcare']

Clinton would indeed represent that class very well.The scandal is that Hillary Clinton would already be in jail as the head of an international crime syndicate if she were not being protected by the media establishment and Obama's political operatives in the Department of Justice. The ferocity with which she is being defended despite her pubic record betrays the moral bankruptcy of too many of elites- not only in government but in the media, the universities, law firms and in the business community.Does anyone need a list of her crimes and her national security fiascoes? Should we ask voters to print a list of known crimes to take with them to the polling booth as a reminder? Maybe the Trump campaign should publish in the top 50 newspapers a full page ad providing a simple list of the top 100 reasons to send HRC back to Arkansas -- while she awaits her day in court.Any full list would occupy a large book and not a newspaper advertisement, but here are a few of the most well-documented crimes and national security nightmares that are in her resume. How many voters really want four years of such self-serving cronyism orchestrated out of the White House?Our true national scandal is not that Clinton has so far escaped indictment, it is that so many of our civic and political institutions have been corrupted by a misguided loyalty to the Clinton crime syndicate.From the board rooms of Wall Street to the editorial boards of local newspapers and the town halls of the League of Women Voters, the defense of the ""progressive cause"" has come down to defending the indefensible -pay-for-play cronyism, open borders  and national security breaches on a global scale.A full chronicle of Hillary Clinton's crimes will someday fill a large shelf of books, if not a whole library.If she is elected President next week, a complete shelf of books will be needed to chronicle her impeachment in Congress, likely removal from office, and the resulting damage to our institutions. The Watergate scandal will look like a Sunday picnic by comparison.The Clinton Crime Syndicate nightmare can be brought to an end by a resounding ""NO!"" vote on Hillary Clinton on November 8. Anything less will be an indictment not of her, but of our own cultural degradation and hopeless cronyism.SIGN UP"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

In those states, the federal government selects a voluntary agency (VOLAG) to operate the program on its behalf under the statutorily questionable Wilson Fish alternative program.Three other states have withdrawn from the federal refugee resettlement program this year: Texas, New Jersey, and Kansas.Nine states withdrew from the federal refugee resettlement program between 1990 and 2015: Kentucky, Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nevada, Tennessee, Alabama, Louisiana, and Alaska.In three other states, Vermont, Colorado, and Massachusetts, the federal government operates the refugee resettlement program under the Wilson Fish alternative program, even though those states have not withdrawn from the program.The Tennessee General Assembly is suing the federal government for its operation of the federal refugee resettlement in the state of Tennessee on Tenth Amendment grounds, an argument that is only available to the thirteen states that have formally withdrawn from the federal program.In those states, state taxpayers are required by the federal government to pay for the medical, housing, English as a Second Language, welfare, and translation expenses of refugees resettled within their jurisdiction without their consent. This amounts to an unfunded liability.The Center for Immigration Studies estimated that in the state of Tennessee these expenses amount to $165 million annually.In October, the Tennessee General Assembly ""selected the Thomas More Law Center to represent the state in its lawsuit against the federal government over the resettlement of refugees in the Volunteer State.""The Thomas More Law Center, which is representing the Tennessee General Assembly at no cost to the state, is expected to file the lawsuit in federal district court within the next few months.Both Texas and Alabama have also sued the federal government to end the refugee resettlement program in their states, but only on the grounds that the federal government has failed to comply with the ""consultation clause"" of the Refugee Act of 1980, which requires the federal government and the director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement to consult with local and state governments prior to resettling refugees within their jurisdictions.Both lawsuits lost in federal district court and are now on appeal. The courts ruled, in part, that even a cursory communication of intent to place refugees in a state with that state's government complies with the consultation clause.That argument, however, is not available to the federal government in the case of local governments with which they have had no communications.Such is the situation in Oakland County, Michigan, where County Executive L. Brooks Patterson said in September he intends to sue the federal government for its placement of thousands of refugees in the county over the past decade without providing any communication to him or other county officials.Gov. LePage of Maine did not immediately respond to inquiries from Breitbart News as to whether he intends to have Maine join Tennessee's Tenth Amendment lawsuit against the federal government to end the refugee resettlement program in his state as well.It is unclear if LePage's announcement four days before Tuesday's presidential election will have an impact on the outcome of the contest between Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton in the state.Maine is one of only two states in which electoral college votes in the presidential election are not allocated on a winner take-all basis. Two of Maine's electoral college votes are given to the statewide winner, while the two other electoral college votes are given to the winner in each of the state's two Congressional Districts.As of Saturday, Real Clear Politics classifies both the state of Maine and the Second Congressional district as tossups, and the First Congressional District as ""Leans Clinton.""

After it made its way up to Clinton, she sent it to ""Diane Reynolds,"" an email pseudonym for Chelsea Clinton.""See below,"" Clinton told her daughter. The entire email chain has been blacked out on confidential grounds, the lowest level of classification.The chain was among the State Department's last release of documents from Clinton's private server before Tuesday's presidential election.The department classified portions of two other emails released Friday.They concerned phone calls Clinton had planned in November 2010 with the United Arab Emirates' crown prince and Afghan President Hamid Karzai. At the time, WikiLeaks' release of hundreds of thousands of diplomatic cables was roiling U.S. relations with governments around the world.The emails were written by Clinton's deputy chief of staff, Huma Abedin. The department designated portions of each ""confidential."" State Department spokesman Mark Toner said neither document was marked classified when it was sent.Friday's release, four days before Election Day, included 74 emails totaling 285 pages. The FBI provided the emails to the State Department after uncovering them as part of its investigation of Clinton's email practices.Many emails are near duplicates of documents the department released after receiving 55,000 pages from Clinton in 2014.Some reflect minor additions, such as Clinton asking an aide to print out the exchange on paper.SIGN UP"	['Clinton']	[]

Al-Sami asks, adding that it's time to bring down the barriers restricting women.Writing in the London-based daily Al-Hayat, Lebanese journalist Jihad Al-Khazen noted that only one of 22 female heads of state was Muslim and none of them were Arab.""Had women controlled the world, there would have been no wars, and we would have seen fat women happy with their weight.  I jest,"" Al-Khazen wrote.Al-Khazen noted that during President Barack Obama's first term there were only two Arab women out of a total of 25 female ambassadors in Washington. However, Al-Khazen wrote, neither were Muslim: ""The Bahraini ambassador, Huda Nonoo, was Jewish, and former Bahraini ambassador to London Alice Samaan was Christian.""According to Al-Khazen, women are superior to men.""Arab women are better than the Arab men - that is my opinion.

Tim Kaine cheered the demographic transformation of the United States caused by the nation's federal immigration policies, telling his Latino audience on Thursday, ""You are the future of America.""SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""By 2050, communities of color will represent the majority of our population,"" Kaine said. ""So, of course, Latinos will help shape the future of America because you are the future of America.""As the Pew Research Center has documented, this demographic transformation is largely the result of the changes to visa issuance policies enacted into law in 1965 that lifted the immigration controls put in place by Calvin Coolidge during the 1920s. In 1965, Ted Kennedy helped usher in policies that offered American green cards to the entire world. The demographic change that resulted is almost entirely through legal issuances of immigration visas to people from non-Western countries.In 1970, fewer than one in 21 Americans was foreign-born. Today, as a result of the federal government's four-decades-long green card gusher, nearly one in seven U.S. residents was born in a foreign country. The transformation has been felt across the nation. For instance, in Kaine's state of Virginia, up until 1970, only one in 100 Virginians was born outside of the United States; by 2012, 11 in every 100 Virginians was foreign-born, according to a recent census study conducted by UVA researchers.Pew projects that if visa issuances continue at their current record pace -- as they will unless Congress passes a law to change them -- ""by 2065, the composition of the nation's immigrant population will change again. ... The country's overall population will feel the impact of these shifts."" It continues, ""Non-Hispanic whites are projected to become less than half of the U.S. population by 2055 and 46 percent by 2065. No racial or ethnic group will constitute a majority of the U.S. population.""Yet during his remarks, Kaine laid out how a Clinton administration plans to hasten the demographic transformation through expansive immigration policies that would essentially bring about the dissolution of national borders.Kaine explained how a Clinton-Kaine administration would ""end family detention,"" ""close private detention facilities,"" freeze deportations, and would give citizenship--and, by extension, voting privileges and access to federal benefits--to the illegal population.Kaine also doubled down on his pledge to expand President Obama's executive amnesty:A few months ago, the Supreme Court put DAPA on hold. That was devastating for millions of families. But it's important to note that the Court didn't actually rule on the substance of the case. Hillary and I have always said that DAPA is squarely within the President's authority, and we will keep fighting for it.Additionally, Kaine promised to continue birthright citizenship -- meaning a pregnant foreign national in the country illegally can give birth to a child, who will be awarded U.S. citizen, and is, therefore, entitled to collect federal welfare, vote in U.S. elections, and eventually obtain green cards for his or her parents, despite their prior illegal entry into the United States.Polling data from Pew suggests that 83 percent of the American electorate is opposed to Clinton's vision of expanding immigration. Yet during a private speech to Goldman Sachs executives, Clinton declared that Americans who want to limit immigration are ""fundamentally un-American""-- an astonishing statement given that polling shows an overwhelming majority of the American public wants to see immigration levels frozen or reduced.During his remarks, Kaine also attacked Trump's prior calls for assimilation and language patriotism. Specifically, Kaine denounced Trump's criticism of Jeb Bush for campaigning in Spanish to become President of the United States. Trump said, ""I think it's wonderful [to speak Spanish] ... but we have a country where, to assimilate, you have to speak English. We have to have assimilation to have a country. ... This is a country where we speak English, not Spanish.""Kaine denounced Trump's view and argued that it ""just [makes] sense"" that a U.S. lawmaker, who is elected to represent American citizens, would discuss important U.S. domestic policies in Spanish:Spanish was the first European language spoken in this country. A few years ago, I gave the first speech ever delivered in Spanish on the Senate floor. Since we were debating a bill about immigration, explaining it in Spanish just made sense - especially since it's the language of more than 40 million people in this country who are most affected by this issue.Technically, becoming a U.S. citizen requires one to achieve English language proficiency, so Kaine's message in Spanish undermines one of the core tenets of American citizenship- albeit one that is already in tatters, as one in five U.S. residents now speaks a language other than English while at home, according to a 2014 report.Within the next few years, if Congress does not act to enact immigration curbs, the foreign-born share of the population of the U.S. will soon shatter all known historical record. As Pew has noted:Fifty years after passage of the landmark law that rewrote U.S. immigration policy, nearly 59 million immigrants have arrived in the United States, pushing the country's foreign-born share to a near record 14%. For the past half-century, these modern-era immigrants and their descendants have accounted for just over half the nation's population growth and have reshaped its racial and ethnic composition. ... Immigration since 1965 has swelled the nation's foreign-born population from 9.6 million then to a record 45 million in 2015. ... At the time [that the immigration rewrite was enacted], relatively few anticipated the size or demographic impact of the post-1965 immigration flow. ... After the replacement of the nation's European-focused origin quota system, greater numbers of immigrants from other parts of the world began to come to the U.S. Among immigrants who have arrived since 1965, half (51%) are from Latin America and one-quarter are from Asia.The record importation of foreign nationals has largely benefited Democratic politicians like Kaine and Clinton. As Reuters reported last year:Immigrants favor Democratic candidates and liberal policies by a wide margin, surveys show, and they have moved formerly competitive states like Illinois firmly into the Democratic column and could turn Republican strongholds like Georgia and Texas into battlegrounds in the years to come.A 2014 report authored by University of Maryland Professor James Gimpel similarly found that ""the enormous flow of legal immigrants in to the country -- 29.5 million 1980 to 2012 -- has remade and continues to remake the nation's electorate in favor of the Democratic Party.""Interestingly, while the importation of Democrat-leaning voters diminishes the electoral impact of conservative voters, it is, ironically, Republican officials who have led the push to resettle even larger numbers of immigrants inside the country. Just last month, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan rejected Donald Trump's call to enact immigration controls so that ""immigration levels, measured by population share, [remain] within historical norms."" Ryan, who shares Clinton's desire for open borders, stands opposed on this issue to nine in ten of his Republican constituents.A few months ago, the Supreme Court put DAPA on hold. That was devastating for millions of families. But it's important to note that the Court didn't actually rule on the substance of the case. Hillary and I have always said that DAPA is squarely within the President's authority, and we will keep fighting for it.Spanish was the first European language spoken in this country.

James O'Keefe's team shows that the Bureau never interviewed a State Department worker who spoke to Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin for a half hour in December 2010 about problems then-Secretary of State Clinton and Abedin were having with her private email system.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROne week ago, FBI director James Comey sent a shockwave through the Hillary Clinton campaign by saying the FBI investigation into the Hillary Clinton email scandal would continue after agents learned about the existence of tens of thousands of emails on a computer used by Hillary Clinton's top aide Huma Abedin and her estranged husband, disgraced Congressman Anthony Weiner.Since that revelation, accusations have flown that the initial FBI investigation was so shoddy that agents inside the FBI were revolting and that James Comey was forced to continue the investigation.Now, for the first time, Project Veritas has video proof of just how shoddy James Comey's original investigation was, after a Project Veritas reporter spoke with State Department worker Cindy Almodovar on November 3rd and 4th. On the video, Mrs. Almodovar makes it clear that not only has she never been talked to by any other journalist, but she was never spoken to by the FBI.On December 17, 2010, U.S. Department of State IT Systems Administrator Cindy Almodovar reported that she met with Huma Abedin for thirty minutes regarding email issues with the @clintoneail.com site.From: Almodovar, Cindy TSent: Friday, December 17, 2010 11:17 AMTo: SES-IRMTech

The subject line was blank. Huma received at Clinton address, but Lona did not receive on her state.gov account.Cindy Trodden AlmodovarS/ES Supervisory Systems AdministratorS/ES-IRM POEMS Help DeskU.S. Department of StateEven in the course of a routine investigation, the FBI would have had reason to at least question Almodovar because of her conversation with Abedin, but there was another reason to question Almodovar, since her immediate supervisor made statements that directly contradict another government report.As the report from the State Department's Office of Inspector General says on page 40, two different staff members raised concerns with their supervisor about Secretary of State Clinton's exclusive use of her private email account for work business, but both were rebuffed. The two staff members worked in the State Department's office of the Executive Secretariat Information Resource Management division (aka S/ES-IR) -- a group supervised by a man named John Bentel.Bentel is one of five people that, it was recently revealed, received an immunity deal from Loretta Lynch's Department of Justice and the FBI. These immunity deals have come under sharp criticism from people such as Republican congressman and House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, who criticized the agencies for ""handing out immunity agreements like candy.""The immunity deal is especially troubling given the details reported in the OIG report claiming that John Bentelwas was warned by subordinates about Hillary Clinton's use of a private email account but attempted to cover it up. As the IRG report says:Two staff in S/ES-IRM reported to OIG that, in late 2010, they each discussed their concerns about Secretary Clinton's use of a personal email account in separate meetings with the then-Director of S/ES-IRM. In one meeting, one staff member raised concerns that information sent and received on Secretary Clinton's account could contain Federal records that needed to be preserved in order to satisfy Federal recordkeeping requirements. According to the staff member, the Director stated that the Secretary's personal system had been reviewed and approved by Department legal staff and that the matter was not to be discussed any further. As previously noted, OIG found no evidence that staff in the Office of the Legal Adviser reviewed or approved Secretary Clinton's personal system. According to the other S/ES-IRM staff member who raised concerns about the server, the Director stated that the mission of S/ES-IRM is to support the Secretary and instructed the staff never to speak of the Secretary's personal email system again.As is the convention in such reports, neither the staffers who made the complaints nor supervisor John Bentel are mentioned by name in the OIG report.According to their notes, the FBI interviewed John Bentel on June 10, 2016 - about two weeks after the OIG report was released. Bentel was a career civil servant, having served 39 years with the State Department until he retired in 2012 as Director of the Executive Secretariat Information Resource Management.In his interview with the FBI, Bentel claimed to have no knowledge that Secretary of State Clinton was using a private server. As the FBI notes say:BENTEL did not learn that HILLARY CLINTON was using a private email server while she was at DOS until it came out in the press last year. He had no knowledge of the server while he was at DOS.In his FBI interview, Bentel went further and claimed that, aside from not being aware of the hardware used to host the email, Bentel had no knowledge of Clinton's use of a personal email account for work-related matters until it was exposed in the press in 2015.BENTEL stated that he did not know CLINTON was using a personal email account for DOS business until after it was released in the papers. BENTEL clarified he knew that CLINTON had a personal email account but that he did not know that she was using it for work related matters. BENTEL did not know if CLINTON had a DOS issued email account.This contradicts the claims made in the OIG report. If John Bentel was informed by two employees in 2010 that they were concerned about Hillary Clinton's use of a private email account, then Bentel is making a false claim to say he was not aware that she was using the personal email account until 2015.According to the FBI file, Bentel also denied that he had ever been approached by anyone with concerns about Sec. Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email account.BENTEL was aware of the Office of Inspector General (OIG) report from May of 2016 in which it was reported that subordinates raised concerns about the Secretary's server to BENTEL in 2010 and he instructed them not to discuss the matter any further. BENTEL denied that anybody had raised such concerns to him. He further stated that the account provided by the OIG report was inconsistent with his open and welcoming management style.If Bentel is telling the truth, then the OIG got the story completely wrong from two different State Department employees and then published an official report with this erroneous information.Of course, the FBI did have a way to confirm which version of events was correct; they simply could have interviewed the two employees that the OIG claims went to Bentel with their concerns.However, nowhere in their notes is there any indication that the FBI interviewed the two employees that the OIG claims went to Bentel and were then told to ""never speak"" about their concerns over Hillary Clinton's email use.As a member of the State Department who worked for Bentel, it would have made sense for the FBI to question Almodovar to see what she knew, but as O'Keefe's team shows, Almodovar was never contacted.At a deposition by Judicial Watch just days ago on October 24th, Bentel asserted his Fifth Amendment right more than 90 times.Bentel's legal team at high-priced law firm Baker Botts includes Randy Turk. In 1995 Turk was hired by Craig Livingstone, head of personnel security at the Clinton White House, to represent him in the ""Filegate"" scandal. As the Daily Caller reported:In 1997, it emerged -- thanks to a subpoena from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee -- that the Clintons had set up a legal defense fund for Livingstone. Fifty-five of the first couple's allies and friends pitched in $9,550 to help defray Livingstone's legal expenses.Bentel could not be reached for comment.From: Almodovar, Cindy T

U.S. Department of StateTwo staff in S/ES-IRM reported to OIG that, in late 2010, they each discussed their concerns about Secretary Clinton's use of a personal email account in separate meetings with the then-Director of S/ES-IRM. In one meeting, one staff member raised concerns that information sent and received on Secretary Clinton's account could contain Federal records that needed to be preserved in order to satisfy Federal recordkeeping requirements. According to the staff member, the Director stated that the Secretary's personal system had been reviewed and approved by Department legal staff and that the matter was not to be discussed any further. As previously noted, OIG found no evidence that staff in the Office of the Legal Adviser reviewed or approved Secretary Clinton's personal system. According to the other S/ES-IRM staff member who raised concerns about the server, the Director stated that the mission of S/ES-IRM is to support the Secretary and instructed the staff never to speak of the Secretary's personal email system again.BENTEL did not learn that HILLARY CLINTON was using a private email server while she was at DOS until it came out in the press last year. He had no knowledge of the server while he was at DOS.BENTEL stated that he did not know CLINTON was using a personal email account for DOS business until after it was released in the papers. BENTEL clarified he knew that CLINTON had a personal email account but that he did not know that she was using it for work related matters. BENTEL did not know if CLINTON had a DOS issued email account.BENTEL was aware of the Office of Inspector General (OIG) report from May of 2016 in which it was reported that subordinates raised concerns about the Secretary's server to BENTEL in 2010 and he instructed them not to discuss the matter any further. BENTEL denied that anybody had raised such concerns to him. He further stated that the account provided by the OIG report was inconsistent with his open and welcoming management style.In 1997, it emerged -- thanks to a subpoena from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee -- that the Clintons had set up a legal defense fund for Livingstone. Fifty-five of the first couple's allies and friends pitched in $9,550 to help defray Livingstone's legal expenses.SIGN UP"	['Baker', 'Clinton']	[]

""Now it will be available further along in someone's pregnancy up until 10 weeks. And that's making a huge difference because before it was only up to 49 days gestation, so we're seeing rates triple in those locations.""Former abortionist Dr. Anthony Levatino uses medical animation to show what happens during a medication abortion. Pro-life group Live Action features the video below:As Levatino describes, two ""pills"" are used for medication abortions. The first pill, Mifepristone, or RU-486, blocks the hormone progesterone, which the mother's body produces to sustain the pregnancy. When progesterone is blocked, the lining of the uterus disintegrates - preventing the baby from receiving blood and nourishment - and the baby dies.The mother then takes a second drug, Misoprostol, 24 to 48 hours later. This drug causes uterine contractions and bleeding until the baby is expelled from the uterus.In March, Planned Parenthood celebrated the FDA's relaxation of the guidelines for Mifepristone:Great news for patients & providers! @US_FDA updated medication abortion guidelines to reflect latest research: https://t.co/S5HDuXjth3-- Planned Parenthood (@PPFA) March 30, 2016In 2013, former Iowa Planned Parenthood clinic manager Sue Thayer exposed the abortion industry giant's move in 2007 to push ""webcam"" medication abortions at every Iowa affiliate via Skype.CBN reported:These abortions are a type of telemedicine that allow a doctor to visit with a patient remotely and then dispense abortion pills using a computerized medicine cabinet. In another clinic, the patient takes one pill to kill her unborn child and then takes another at home to expel it.Planned Parenthood touts the new procedure as a way to more efficiently deliver health care to rural women.""The staff was instructed to say, 'We can take care of that problem today,' 45 minutes in and out,"" Thayer recalled.The efficiency also allows Planned Parenthood to achieve greater cost-savings, Thayer said. It also increases the productivity of its small pool of abortion doctors.According to the report, Thayer soon became concerned about supervising the procedure at her facility, but Planned Parenthood officials told her not to alert doctors in her area about the webcam medication abortions. In addition, Planned Parenthood required her and other non-medical staff to perform transvaginal ultrasounds.""My boss said, 'If you're breathing, you can do it. It helps if you've run a joystick because it's a lot like playing a video game,'"" Thayer explained, adding that, though the FDA had still not approved administering Mifepristone past 49 days of gestation, Planned Parenthood began immediately dispensing it to young girls and women up to day 63 of the pregnancy.Thayer said her expressed concerns and complaints to her bosses at Planned Parenthood led to her being fired in 2008. When she learned her severance package would include the requirement of a signed agreement that she not speak out about what she had seen at Planned Parenthood, she rejected it. Thayer then launched an effort in her community to help women facing crisis pregnancies.Reuters reports that current data it received from Planned Parenthood show that, in Iowa clinics, 64 percent of all abortions performed are now via medications.Planned Parenthood says it charges ""up to $800"" for the ""abortion pill"" procedure. It informs women considering medication abortion that they will be given a ""medication guide, instructions, and other information to take home with you, including a 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week telephone number you can call if you have any questions or concerns.""""You may feel more at ease if you have a trusted loved one with you during the abortion,"" Planned Parenthood suggests, adding that women will need to come into a clinic within one to two weeks for a follow-up visit ""to make sure your abortion is complete.""As Live Action News noted, in 2013, Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California said, ""There is no difference between taking a pill for a cold or taking one to induce an abortion.""Great news for patients & providers! @US_FDA updated medication abortion guidelines to reflect latest research: https://t.co/S5HDuXjth3

Late last month, he drew an estimated crowd of 20,000 at the MidFlorida Amphitheatre - adjacent to Saturday's venue.
 Trump kicked off his rally by taking a dig at Hillary Clinton - jabbing her for last night's rally she held that included a performance by Beyonce and Jay Z.""We don't need Jay Z to fill up the arena,"" he said. ""We do it the old fashion way. We do it the old fashion way, folks. We fill it up because you love what we are saying and you want to make America great again. That's about it.""""And I actually like Jay Z but you know the language last night -- ooooh, ooooh,"" he continued. ""I was thinking maybe I will just try it. Can you imagine if I used that language about one of them? Can you imagine if I said? He used every word in the book. I won't use the initials because I will get in trouble. They'll get me in trouble. He used every word in the book last night.""The GOP nominee vowed he would win Florida and touted his previous success in the Sunshine State. He reminded rallygoers of his dominance in last March's Republican presidential preference primary, taking 66 of 67 counties with the lone exception being Sen. Marco Rubio's home county of Miami-Dade.After mocking Clinton for her inability to maintain the pace he has in these closing days of the campaign, Trump drew one of his loudest applauses when he pledged to end the Syrian refugee program and ""keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.""""We will become a rich nation again,"" he declared. ""But to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees pouring into this country, over and above the thousands and thousands and thousands that are already coming in. You want to see a problem? This will be the great Trojan Horse - modern day version. Her plan will import extremism and radicalism into your schools and throughout your communities. When I'm elected president, we will suspend immediately the Syrian refugee program and we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.""Trump took aim at the media -- a regular target at his rallies - and told his audience he would ""sit down with the dishonest media.""""Our country has never been in a situation like it is in right,"" Trump said. ""So dishonest, it is a rigged system, folks. I have been saying it. It is a rigged system and it begins with the media because the media rigs it. Did you see all those reports with The New York Times where The New York Times are sending them things? They're saying -- listen, we got this reporter essentially, 100 percent, this is friendly stuff. Where other reporters are sending them stories to check. Do you have any change in? That's never happened to me. Man, I actually used to get good publicity until I decided to run. Now, I think I have -one of the writers of the Times, we don't care if it is fair or not. It is the greatest pile on in the history of politics and that's OK. I used to be on the other side. Don't forget, I did very well. But I also love our country and it was time, it was time. We had to do something. But that is a big part of the rigged system.Another highlight of Saturday's event included Trump bringing a baby from the crowd up on stage with him and showing the baby off as ""an early Trump fan.""Look at this baby,"" Trump said to the crowd. ""They did a great job, wow. That is a great, beautiful baby, congratulations. That's an early Trump fan, right?""Saturday's visit to Hillsborough County in the Sunshine State comes just two before Election Day. On Monday morning, Trump visits Sarasota in Manatee County 50 miles south of today's venue.Later Saturday, Clinton will pay a visit on the other side of the Florida peninsula in Broward County's Pembroke Pines. Turnout in heavily Democrat Broward County will be essential for Clinton's success. Indeed this is her second appearance in Broward County in less than week.The battle for Florida's 29 electoral votes remains in the toss-up column  and Hillsborough County will be pivotal in Tuesday's outcome. As has this county has gone in the previous four presidential elections, so has the presidency, with it going for George W.

He said he has gotten a lot of criticism since he told media outlets last month that he might not vote for Clinton. But he said he has also heard from electors in other states who thanked him for speaking out. He said he hopes some of those electors follow his lead.According to the National Archives, 99 percent of electors through U.S. history have voted for their party's candidate, and none of the dissenters has ever changed the result of an election.SIGN UP"	['Sanders', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

Byrne tells Breitbart News when Crisis of Character came out he expected political allies of Hillary Clinton, such as David Brock and his organization Media Matters, to attack him because his eyewitness account of her behavior as First Lady disqualified her from the presidency.The criticism from the Association of Former Agents of the United States Secret Service was not just political, but also part of the agents' culture of disrespect for officers of the services' uniformed officers, he said.If it was up to him, he would sue right away, but his lawyer told him to wait until after the election, he said.""I am not surprised at all that the retired agents association is coming after me,"" he said. ""A lot of Secret Service agents have written books over the years-and I could  not find any case where the retired agents association has come out and attacked those books.""Byrne said that the agents have their own rules for themselves and that the agents themselves become so close to the people they are guarding that they slip seamlessly into the role of political operative and political protector.

""The Uniformed Division, which is what I was, is a part of the Secret Service-there is a term when we work at the White House: ""U-DBashing.""The ""bashing"" of the uniformed officers is so routine and pervasive that the agents resent that a former uniformed officer would ever dare to write a book, he said.Byrne said he would be standing post in the White House and agents, almost out of sport, would belittle the uniformed officers and the division as the U-D's stood there silently taking.Because the uniformed officers were stationed in shacks on the White House grounds and at the gates, the agents would belittle the officers as ""box creatures,"" he said.""There was a lot of negativity,"" he said.

""Bill"" Clinton and White House intern Monica Lewinsky, Byrne was the first member of the uniformed division to testify under oath.

It was at this post that Byrne observed Lewinsky wander around the West Wing until she caught the president's eye. When Byrne stepped up to keep the intern away from the Oval Office, it was the president, who told Byrne let her through-and to close the door.Byrne said while the president and his lawyers fought unsuccessfully to prevent his testimony, claiming ""protective privilege,"" Secret Service agents and senior uniformed officers approached him and tried to persuade him to keep what he saw to himself. ""They would say to me: 'It's not your fault if you can't remember.'""But, not giving full and honest testimony was not an option, he said. ""I swore an oath.""It was also at his Oval Office post that Byrne became friends with the president's Mess Steward, a Navy chief petty officer. Together the two men would go into the president's hallowed office to pick up the lipstick-stained towels and attempt to remove stains from the carpeting, according to his testimony.Although Byrne is now seen at an officer, who told tales out of school, it was the future Air Marshal, he testified that he was the one who convinced the steward to throw the towels away, so that workers in the White House laundry would not have something to gossip about or to spread stories about the goings on in the White House.We have determined that your recent false statements regarding Officer Byrne (both libel and slander in convenient recorded form that you have no chance of disputing) - which were provided to media outlets in advance of release for purely partisan purposes - not only constitute defamation per se but also false light defamation in relevant jurisdictions in which we plan to pursue legal action against you and AFAUSSS.

Bader read a story in the The Hill that fed into the narrative that the Wisconsin congressman may step away after the election:Chatter is growing louder on Capitol Hill that Paul Ryan's days as Speaker are numbered.Four House Republicans, including a senior lawmaker close to leadership, told The Hill they expect Ryan to step down after Tuesday's elections, arguing that he faces a daunting path to the 218 votes he needs to win a full two-year term leading the House GOP.Bader then asked Ryan: ""A simple question for you, can you say with 100 percent certainly you seek another term as speaker?""Ryan, who was calling in from a bus tour of the Badger State, said to the host: ""Yes, I can. This is the typical chatter you have every two years that they call 'palace intrigue' in the Hill rags. I am going to seek staying on as speaker.""The speaker said he was proud of his Better Way agenda that he developed and now he was looking in the next session of Congress to executing the agenda. ""There is a lot of unfinished work to do. I think I can do a lot to help our cause, our party.""Ryan told Bader that for the next four days, he was going to be on a bus with Sen. Ron Johnson throughout the state and he is scheduled to rally Saturday with Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, the GOP nominee for vice president, in Mukwonago, Wisconsin.Wisconsin is a battleground state.""Just imagine the scandal baggage Hillary Clinton brings in-if she were to get elected-on top of the liberal-Obama agenda she wants to prosecute,"" he said.Ryan said it is too bad that young people do not remember what the Clinton's put the country through in the 1990s.""This is what life with the Clinton's looks like-there is always a scandal around the corner-then, there is some kind of investigation-you never know what's coming next,"" he said""They play the system to enrich themselves through what everyone calls: 'Clinton Incorporated,'"" he said.""Let that be a case for voting for Trump-Pence-Johnson.""Chatter is growing louder on Capitol Hill that Paul Ryan's days as Speaker are numbered.

This week, at London's National Gallery, he was presented by the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe (ACRE) with the Edmund Burke Award. In his acceptance speech (which you can read in full here), he argued that now more than ever conservatism matters.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERHere are some of the highlights:No, climate change is not the great moral challenge of our ageI often hear of those on the Left saying the great moral challenge of our age is climate change. I think that's nonsense. The great moral challenge of our age remains as it has been for many ages: the removal, through fair means of free-market-based growth, of the gap between the rich and the poor.That's the great moral challenge. And that is the methodology by which that gap should be closed. Not by state ownership and redistribution. But rather, by the fruits of competitive capitalism and globalisation.Politics is not a public relations contest - it's a battle of ideasWhen I think of those towering figures of world conservatism, Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, we are instantaneously reminded that theirs were lives committed to the great battle of ideas.When Ronald Reagan told his speechwriters that he was going to deliver a speech calling on Mr. Gorbachev to tear down that wall, they shuffled their feet. Many of his foreign affairs advisors said well maybe it's not quite the right time to say that. The Wall had been up for a few years by then. But he went ahead and he did it.Reagan was an exemplar of a person who understood that at crucial moments in the history of his own nation, and of the world, there was a time to stand against any tide of nervous public opinion in favour of principle. As far as he was concerned, there was a great principle involved.The growth of identity politics is a menaceAnd it's very important that we understand that we are dealing with an electorate that is more prone to approaches not based on principle, but on what I regard as the insidious rise of identity politics. Identity politics whereby you seek to gather the support of a group based on what that group has in common, not the support of that group for a common principle which might gain acceptance throughout the entire community. That is not a healthy development.Brexit reminded us of the primacy of the nation stateI think it's also important to remind ourselves - and this is perhaps the one comment that I might make on your recent referendum on membership of the European Union - is that despite what we are frequently told by many, we still live in a world of the nation state. It is still a Westphalian world. It is still a world where the key organising principle of world affairs is relations between nations.That is not a call to move away from international cooperation. It is simply a recognition of what the nation state can achieve.The most important ingredients for a successful conservative nation state are...If you have a robust parliamentary system, if you have a completely free media, if you have an incorruptible judiciary, you've got the elements of a free society - you've got the basics.Political correctness is undermining free speech - and this is very worrying, as these two examples showRecently, a well-known cartoonist in The Australian magazine, Bill Leak, published a brilliant cartoon which depicted an Aboriginal policeman holding an Aboriginal boy and confronting the father of that boy and saying to the father: ""It's about time you taught him about personal responsibility."" The father, holding a can of beer, said: ""Righto, what's his name then?""It was a brilliant, perceptive cartoon, that made the point that failed fatherhood is a series problem - and I think it was a point that was applauded around the community, not just in relation to the Aboriginal community, where failed fatherhood is a problem, but other communities where the same is true.And yet, for his pains, this man and his magazine were dragged before the human rights commission in Australia and asked to explain. That is a terrible assault on free speech. A terrible assault on free speech. Burke would be appalled - rightly so.I think Burke would also be appalled about what I might loosely call the baker's case in Northern Ireland. Where a baker has a view about same-sex marriage which he's entitled to have, which other people don't have, but that's not the point. The point is he gets prosecuted for refusing to place a statement on the icing of a cake that does not reflect his own personal view. And the man ends up being dragged before the courts.I don't condemn the judge - the judge was enforcing his interpretation of the law. But if we really live in the shadow of Edmund Burke, and we revere him, and we value his principles, then surely we would look at those two examples of the way in which a creeping political correctness has spread, the manner by which any discrimination laws have been carried to almost demented lengths, and we would express our concern and our alarm at those developments.SIGN UP"	[]	[]

Just 14 percent said she's done nothing wrong.By comparison, 79 percent think Donald Trump did something wrong, though not nearly as many think he did something illegal.

29	29	http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/11/05/trump-gains-african-american-support/	Polls Show African-American Vote for Donald Trump is Double Mitt Romney’s Vote	"Donald Trump is on track to double Gov. Mitt Romney's support among African-American voters, according to a series of state polls. SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIn 2012, African-Americans comprised a record 13 percent of all voters. President Barack Obama was reelected with 93 percent of the African-American vote, leaving Gov. Mitt Romney with only 6 percent of the African-American vote. Obama is now campaigning against Trump, and hoping to keep his share of the African-American vote below the 11 percent that George W. Bush won in 2004 during the housing bubble.  On Friday, a poll of 506 Pennsylvania voters by Harper Polling showed Trump has the support of 18.46 percent of African-Americans. That's 12.5 points more than Romney's share of the national vote in 2012, and if it proves true during the ballot, that 18.46 percent African-American support translates into 2 point shift towards Trump. The poll also said another 4.6 percent were undecided. The Harper poll is small, with an error margin of 4.4 percent, but an Oct. 30 poll of 1,249 likely voters in Pennsylvania showed Trump has 19 percent support among African Americans, while another 7 percent remain undecided. That poll has a error margin of 2.77 percent. In next-door Michigan, two nights of a tracking poll conducted for Fox 2 of 1,150 likely voters showed Trump with 14 percent support and 19 percent support, leaving Clinton with 83 percent and 79 percent support. That's equivalent to a two-point shift from Clinton to Trump in the state.""We're showing Donald Trump doing far better among African-Americans than any other Republican in modern memory, said John Yob, CEO of a Michigan-based polling firm, Strategic National. Trump ""has done an excellent job in campaigning for the votes of African-Americans,"" he said, partly by campaigning in Detroit, said Yob, whose automated tracking polls show Trump and Clinton running level in the state. Trump is gaining in Michigan partly because many African-American voters -- especially younger voters who backed Sen. Bernie Saunders -- distrust Clinton, said Wayne Bradley, state director of African-American engagement for the Michigan Republican Party. ""There is a tremendous  trust deficit with Hillary Clinton"" because tough anti-crime laws established when her husband was president in the 1990s, he said. That distrust has helped cause a sharp drop in the number of absentee ballots mailed in from Detroit, even as other part of the state send in more ballots that before, Bradley said. Faced with a low turnout, the Clinton campaign is trying to frighten African-Americans to vote, but ""that's not a convincing enough argument,"" he said.""Detroit as of Wednesday had seen absentee ballots returns equaling just 46 percent of the total 2012 absentee vote in the city, and the city clerk's office is forecasting a decline of 10,000 absentee ballots compared to 2012, a fall of 12.5 percent,"" according to a review of absentee records by the Gongwer.com website, which intensively tracks Michigan politics. It is ""possible that the falloff portends reduced [election day] voting at the precincts, in which case ... Clinton could net something like 32,000 fewer votes out of the city than President Barack Obama did in 2012.""But other polls offer better news to Clinton. A Detroit Free Press poll of 600 likely Michigan voters released Nov. 4 showed that ""Among black voters, her margin also grew substantially, to 92% compared to 88% two weeks ago.""National TrendsTrump's gain among African-American voters is happening in many states, alongside an overall reduction in African-American enthusiasm and support for Obama's designated successor. That drop-off in support from Obama's 93 percent level will likely reduce the turnout for Clinton.That's a problem for Democrats, because a 7.5 percent drop in nationwide African-American turnout would be equal to a one-point drop in a nationwide vote for Clinton. Reports say the early-voting turnout by African-Americans has dropped by up to 10 percent in North Carolina and by somewhat less in Florida. President Barack Obama and other top Democrats  have hopscotched through the states to push that turnout back up by election day. But pollsters face problems when trying to gauge opinions in a high-stakes emotional competition.For example, a large slice of African-Americans are picking ""undecided"" in some polls. The Washington Post is reporting that Clinton is leading Trump by 79 percentage points among African-Americans, but the fine print in the article says Clinton's score is 82 percent and Trump's score is 3 percent -- leaving 15 percent who did not pick either candidate. So if Trump gets just one-in-five of the undecided African-American voters, he reaches Romney's 2012 level.Some concerned people lie to pollsters. For example, roughly 7 percent of college grads hide their support for Trump when they're ask by pollsters over the phone, perhaps out of fear of penalties if their choice was made public. So when polls show a non-answer from respondents, for example, many undecided voters, the votes may be hiding a weak or strong preference for Trump.These factor may be impacting polls of African-Americans, who are being hammered by claims from Clinton and Obama that Trump is supposedly a racist. ""If you accept the support of Klan sympathizers -- the Klan -- and hesitate when asked about that support, then you'll tolerate that support when you're in office,"" Obama told an African-American crowd in North Carolina on Nov. 3.For example, Public Policy Polling -- which mostly works for Democratic clients -- used phone interviews in a poll that showed Trump with just 9 percent support in Michigan among 957 likely voters, of whom 12 percent were African-American. The poll said none of the roughly 110 African-Americans were undecided in a two-person race, even though 8 percent said they were unsure when they were asked if they had a favorable view of Trump. In contrast, the Harper Polling survey in Pennsylvania got very different answers from African-Americans. Trump got 18.5 percent support in a four-person race, although many respondents waffled when they were asked to pick between just Clinton and Trump. When asked to pick either of the two main candidates, only 12.3 percent supported Trump, while 13.9 percent declared themselves to be undecided. So Trump actually picked up half of the undecideds when the respondents were allowed to chose from the four candidates.PollsA national poll by TIPP showed Clinton at only 75 percent support among all non-whites, including Hispanics, African-Americans and Latinos. That poll showed Trump getting support from 15 percent of non-whites, leaving 5 percent undecided and 5 percent supporting other candidates. In North Carolina, 19 percent of African-Americans support Trump, according to an Oct. 30 survey of 1176 likely voters by Remington Research Group.An Oct. 28 to Oct. 31 poll in North Carolina by SurveyUSA showed Trump with 14 percent support in a poll of 800 adults, including 659 likely voters. African-Americans comprised 21 percent of the voters in the poll. SurveyUSA is the top-ranked pollster in Nate Silver's rankings.But a late October poll of African-Americans in North Carolina by Siena University showed 89 percent support for Clinton and 1 percent for Trump -- but it also showed 6 percent staying they did not know who they will vote for, and 11 percent support for the GOP Gov. Pat McCrory.In Florida, a Siena University poll showed that Trump had the support of 13 percent of African-Americans. More ominously for Clinton, she had the support of only 83 percent, while 4 percent said they didn't know who to vote for. If Trump gets one-quarter of the 4 percent, he reaches 14 percent of the African-American vote, leaving Clinton with roughly 86 percent.In Virginia, a survey by Public Policy Polling taken in Nov. 3 and Nov. 4 showed Trump with 9 percent support and Clinton with 91 percent support. A Remington Research automated poll of 1,106 likely voters in Virginia showed Trump with 19 percent, and Clinton with just 78 percent support.In Georgia, a Nov. 2 to Nov. 3 poll of 1,000 likely voters showed Trump with 12 percent of the African-American vote, leaving Clinton with 85 percent.Amid the disagreement, rivalries and complexity, Bradley is confident that Trump will do well among African-Americans. His final tally as the GOP candidate ""will be a higher number that it has been in the past... [because] he's working, he's coming to these cities to deliver the message.""The African-American vote may even be enough to help push Trump over the so-called ""blue wall"" of Democratic northern states that stands in his path to the White House.SIGN UPDonald Trump is on track to double Gov.
