Don Jr. is floated to be Interior Secretary.""The camera then shows photos of Trump's agricultural advisers intermingled with photos of pigs in metal stalls, a dirty puppy, and a horse. The narrator says, ""Trump's agricultural advisers support confining pigs, like this, allowing cruel puppy meals, even making horse slaughter legal. It's a frightening picture. A Trump presidency would be a threat to animals everywhere.""On September 19 Breitbart News reported a Trump ad in which he pledged to protect hunting and fishing, along with the Second Amendment. The ad started with Donald Jr. urging hunters to be vocal and stand up for their traditions. He warned, ""If you don't start being vocal, if you don't show up and vote your conscience on these things, it's going to be gone.""Donald Jr. was followed by law enforcement personnel, television personalities, farmers, and celebrities. It closed with Trump saying:I'm so happy and thrilled to have the support of America's sportsmen and sportswomen.

(AP) -- A New Jersey Transit train that crashed into Hoboken's terminal last week, killing one person and injuring more than 100 others, was going twice the speed limit at the moment of impact, and the train's engineer hit the emergency brake less than a second before the crash, federal investigators said Thursday.The National Transportation Safety Board said the findings were gleaned from data recorders aboard the train.The speed limit for the station area is 10 mph.The NTSB said the train was traveling at 8 mph and the throttle was in the idle position less than a minute before the crash. The throttle was increased approximately 38 seconds before the collision and the train speeded up, reaching a maximum of about 21 mph, the agency said.The throttle went back to idle just prior to the collision, and the engineer hit the emergency brake less than a second before the train hit a bumping post at the end of the rail line.Also Thursday, New Jersey Transit implemented a new rule for pulling into two of its stations.The conductor must join the engineer whenever a train pulls into Hoboken Terminal or its Atlantic City station, NJ Transit spokeswoman Jennifer Nelson said. That means a second set of eyes will be watching as a train enters the final phase of its trip at stations where there are platforms at the end of the rails.The New York Times first reported the policy.The engineer was alone when the train crashed into the Hoboken station last Thursday. He has told federal investigators he had no memory of the crash.Investigators recovered the data recorder, a video recorder and the engineer's cellphone from the front car of the NJ Transit train on Tuesday afternoon. The equipment was sent to an agency lab in Washington for analysis, officials said.Some rail-safety experts caution that having a second person in a cab isn't automatically safer, since crew members can sometimes distract each other. In 1996 outside Washington, D.C., a commuter train engineer was thought to have been distracted by a conversation with a crew member, causing a crash with an Amtrak train that killed 11 people.A final report on what caused last week's crash could take a year or longer to complete.SIGN UP

In the Dominican Republic, four deaths were reported.In addition to the death toll and the destruction of infrastructure, the area has experienced an uptick in cholera cases because of increased flooding in the region.At least three cases of cholera were reported in Jeremie, on the southwestern tip of Haiti, said Holly Frew, a spokeswoman for the aid group CARE in the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince.Cholera is a potentially deadly disease spread by contaminated water. Flooding increases the risk of cholera's spread, and relief agencies are trying to figure out how to bring clean water and emergency sanitation systems to affected areas.Some areas of Haiti were totally destroyed and leveled to the ground by the Category 4 storm, according to aerial images from the U.S. Coast Guard. Roofs were ripped off of homes, wooden houses became pieces of wood, and palm groves were leveled to the ground.Relief efforts are already underway in the country.The U.S. Navy has sent three ships to Haiti, including an aircraft carrier and a hospital ship carrying 300 Marines, The Post reported.Hurricane Matthew is expected to head towards the U.S. later Thursday, heading up the coastline to South Carolina.SIGN UP

(AP) -- Leaving more than 100 dead in its wake across the Caribbean, Hurricane Matthew steamed toward heavily populated Florida with terrifying winds of 140 mph Thursday, and 2 million people across the Southeast were warned to flee inland.It was the most powerful storm to threaten the U.S. Atlantic coast in more than a decade.""The storm has already killed people. We should expect the same impact in Florida,"" Gov. Rick Scott said as the skies began darkening from Matthew's outer bands of rain.The hurricane gained fury as it closed in, growing from a possibly devastating Category 3 storm to a potentially catastrophic Category 4 by late morning.It was expected to scrape nearly the entire length of Florida's Atlantic coast beginning Thursday evening. From there, forecasters said, it would most likely push along the coast of Georgia and South Carolina before veering out to sea.Millions of people in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina were told to evacuate their homes, and interstate highways were turned into one-way routes to speed the exodus. Scott said Florida could be looking at its biggest evacuation ever.Many boarded up their homes and businesses and left them to the mercy of the storm.Daniel Myras, who has lived for 25 years in Daytona Beach, where he owns the Cruisin Cafe two blocks from the boardwalk, struggled to find enough plywood to protect his restaurant.""We're not going to take any chances on this one,"" he said. ""I have the feeling that this one is the one that makes Daytona realize that we need to get ready for storms.""He added: ""A lot of people here, they laugh, and say they've been through storms before and they're not worried. But I think this is the one that's going to give us a wake-up call.""President Barack Obama declared a state of emergency for Florida, freeing up federal money and personnel to protect lives and property.Forecasters said Matthew's fiercest winds appeared unlikely to strike Miami or Fort Lauderdale, the most densely populated areas in Florida, with about 4.4 million residents. Those cities were expected to get tropical storm-force winds of between 39 mph and 73 mph.Instead, forecasters said the West Palm Beach and Cape Canaveral areas farther north could get the brunt of the storm. More than 1.3 million people live in Palm Beach County and about 568,000 in Brevard County, home to Cape Canaveral and NASA's Kennedy Space Center.The last Category 3 storm or higher to hit the U.S. was Wilma in October 2005. It sliced across Florida with 120 mph winds, killing five people and causing an estimated $21 billion in damage.As people hurried to higher ground, authorities in South Carolina said a motorist died on Wednesday after being shot by deputies in a gun battle that erupted after he sped away from a checkpoint along a storm evacuation route.Matthew killed at least 114 people as it roared through the Caribbean. Officials said at least 108 of those deaths were in desperately poor Haiti, where many towns were cut off by the storm and the magnitude of the disaster was just beginning to come into focus two days later.In the Bahamas, authorities reported many downed trees and power lines but no immediate deaths.As of 2 p.m. EDT, Matthew was 125 miles southeast of West Palm Beach, Florida, moving toward the city at about 14 mph. Nearly all of Florida's Atlantic coast and Georgia's entire coast were under hurricane warnings.With hurricane-force winds extending outward up to 60 miles from the storm's center, Matthew could wreak havoc along the coast even if it were to stay just offshore.Forecasters said it could dump up to 15 inches of rain in some spots and cause a storm surge of 9 feet.They said the major threat to the Southeast would not be the punishing winds - which newer buildings can withstand - but the massive surge of seawater that could wash over coastal communities.The Miami-based National Hurricane Center said life-threatening flooding could happen along some 500 miles of coastline from Boca Raton in South Florida all the way to the Charleston, South Carolina, area.Patients were transferred from two Florida waterfront hospitals and a nursing home near Daytona Beach to safer locations.In inland Orlando, Walt Disney World, Universal Studios and SeaWorld announced plans to close early.""I never get time off. I'm a little sad,"" tourist Amber Klinkel, 25, of Battle Creek, Michigan, lamented at Universal.The Fort Lauderdale Airport shut down, and the Orlando airport planned to do so as well. Airlines canceled more than 2,800 flights Thursday and Friday, many of them in or out of Miami and Fort Lauderdale.Some coastal residents decided to take their chances and stay.Deborah Whyte walked her dogs at Jupiter Beach Park in the morning to check the surf.""We boarded up our house and I boarded up my store"" in Tequesta,"" she said. ""And we're just hunkering down and waiting for it.""Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal ordered a mandatory evacuation of the entire Georgia coast, covering more than a half-million people. The Georgia coast hasn't seen a hurricane evacuation since 1999, when it narrowly escaped Floyd.""We have a house that sits right here on the water and we kind of said goodbye to it thinking that, you know, the house sits here on the water and might not be here when we get back,"" said Jennifer Banker, a resident of Georgia's dangerously exposed St. Simons Island. ""You know, we pray a lot and trust God to provide.""Many people in historic Savannah, Georgia, a city of handsome antebellum mansions that hasn't taken a direct hit from a major hurricane since 1898, heeded the order to leave.""Hurricane Matthew is a storm not to be messed with,"" Savannah Mayor Eddie DeLoach said.

The first presidential debate was held on September 26. The two polls had roughly comparable sample sizes (600 respondents for Emerson, 696 for UNF) and similar margins of error (plus or minus 3.6 percent and 3.8 percent, respectively.)Emerson has the race at Trump 45 percent, Clinton 44 percent in Florida, while Trump's erstwhile GOP primary competitor Marco Rubio leads Democratic challenger Patrick Murphy by 47 to 39 in the Senate race.Curiously, Emerson finds Clinton slightly ahead among Florida independents (40 to 39), a group where Trump leads in many other surveys, but Trump still has a 1-point lead overall. Clinton leads 59 percent to 36 percent among Hispanics, and 77 percent to 18 percent among black voters.Third-party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein were included in the Emerson survey, but were not major factors, drawing 4 percent and 2.6 percent respectively. Just 4 percent of respondents said they were undecided.As for the University of North Florida poll, it found Clinton leading in Florida by 41 to Trump's 38 in a four-way race. Johnson and Stein were bigger players in this poll, pulling 6 and 3.In a two-way race, UNF finds Clinton's lead expanding beyond the margin of error to 7 points: Clinton 47, Trump 40.""The size of Clinton's lead drops when the additional candidates (Johnson and Stein) are listed in the question. This suggests that the Clinton campaign should perhaps perceive Johnson as a threat, who is taking more votes from her than Trump,"" said poll director Dr. Michael Binder, who thought his survey showed Clinton getting a significant bounce after the first presidential debate.""While neither candidate has high favorability for the majority of likely voters in Florida, Clinton's net negative 9 percent is better than Trump's net negative 23 percent,"" Binder added. However, a slightly higher percentage of Trump's voters said they were primarily voting against Clinton (46 percent) than Clinton voters said they were voting against Trump (43 percent.)Binder noted the UNF poll also found that ""for all of the talk about deportation and 'building walls', majorities of Democrats, NPAs and even Republicans in Florida are supportive of pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.""More specifically, the most popular option for illegal immigrants was ""Allow them to stay in the U.S. and eventually qualify for U.S. citizenship after paying back taxes and fines"" with 49, followed by ""Allow them to stay in the U.S. and eventually qualify for U.S. citizenship without penalties"" at 21.Immigration was the fourth-most pressing concern for Florida voters in the UNF poll at 7 percent, behind jobs and the economy (27), education (10), and health care (8).SIGN UP"

Sanchez's dab was the only noteworthy moment in an otherwise mundane debate between two candidates who agree on almost every issue.Their primary difference is ethnic. Harris, the favorite, is seen as the scion of an ascendant black Democratic political establishment, and enjoys the support of President Barack Obama and California Gov. Jerry Brown, among others. Sanchez carried the hopes for the growing Latino electorate in California, but has struggled to catch up with Harris's growing lead in the polls, and there are signs that Latino voters are increasingly backing Harris.Both candidates in the general election are Democrats, thanks to California's ""top two"" or ""jungle"" primary, in which the top two vote-winners in the primary advance, regardless of party.Sanchez had challenged Harris to four debates, but Harris only agreed to two. Because the campaigns could not agree on the logistics for the second debate, last night's debate, held at the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at Cal State Los Angeles.Joel B.

Stearns County authorities said Falconer's use of deadly force was justified and that he shouted numerous times he was a police officer as he ordered Adan to drop the weapons.The stabbings left 10 people wounded at the mall; none had life threatening injuries.Thornton on Thursday confirmed that Adan asked several people during the attacks if they were Muslim and that during one stabbing was heard to say,""Allahu akbar,"" the Arabic phrase for God is great.Thornton described Adan, 20, as someone who had been more interested in basketball and video games than religion but then changed in the months before the attack.He ""went from being an excellent student with a high GPA to flunking out of college, almost overnight,"" Thornton said.Thornton said the investigation is ongoing. The FBI is tracing Adan's social media and other digital activity. He also said Adan's iPhone is locked and the FBI is assessing its next steps in gaining access.""Authorities on Thursday didn't detail the nature of Adan's likely radicalization.

Adan responded, ""You won't be seeing me again.""He also hit a bicyclist but didn't stop.Adan began attacking people before entering the mall.Authorities also released videos of Adan stabbing a store clerk and of Falconer confronting him, showing his badge, and of Adan coming toward him with a knife in his hand even after Falconer had shot him.Adan's family rejected the FBI's conclusions, according to the Associated Press.the attorney for Adan's family, Abdulwahid Osman, said his parents and close family members did not see the behavioral changes that investigators described.

Minnesota has the nation's largest Somali community, with census numbers placing the population at about 57,000. Young Somalis have been a target for [Islamic] terror recruiters. Since 2007, more than 20 young men have joined the militant group al-Shabab in Somalia. In addition, roughly a dozen people have left to join militants in Syria, and nine Minnesota men face sentencing on terror charges for plotting to join the Islamic State group.They also praised the heroism of Jason Falconer, the off-duty officer who shot and killed Adan after the attacker came at him several times, knives in hand. Stearns County authorities said Falconer's use of deadly force was justified and that he shouted numerous times he was a police officer as he ordered Adan to drop the weapons.
The stabbings left 10 people wounded at the mall; none had life threatening injuries.
Thornton on Thursday confirmed that Adan asked several people during the attacks if they were Muslim and that during one stabbing was heard to say,""Allahu akbar,"" the Arabic phrase for God is great.
Thornton described Adan, 20, as someone who had been more interested in basketball and video games than religion but then changed in the months before the attack.
He ""went from being an excellent student with a high GPA to flunking out of college, almost overnight,"" Thornton said.

Jeff Sessions: Senate Must Investigate FBI’s ‘Breathtaking’ Destruction of Evidence, Immunity to Cheryl Mills	"Sen. Jeff Sessions tells radio talk show Howie Carr he's lost confidence in FBI Director James B. Comey Jr.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe Alabama Republican adds that he thinks the Senate should investigate how the FBI granted immunity to Clinton Foundation director Cheryl Mills and destroyed evidence under congressional subpoena.""I was a U.S. attorney and an assistant U.S. attorney before that and I have been through a lot of these issues,"" Sessions says.Sessions said when he was a Department of Justice lawyer, he worked regularly with FBI agents and he was always impressed by their professionalism and their apolitical approach to their work.""I love the FBI,"" he said.But, now after witnessing the extraordinary handling of evidence, witnesses involved in the scandal surrounding Hillary Clinton's private email scheme and her handling of classified electronic correspondence, he is forced to reassess, he said.Clinton is the Democratic nominee for president and Comey announced July 5 that he was recommending to the Department of Justice that she not be prosecuted in regard to the scandal.""This is scary to me,"" Sessions tells Carr. ""I tried not to be critical of Comey at first.""Sessions said the more he learns about Comey and the FBI's operating outside of the bureau's regular practices, the more concerned he becomes.While the House of Representatives has made an effort to investigate Comey and the FBI's behavior in the Clinton email scandal, the Senate needs to get involved also, he said.Central to the FBI's mismanagement of the scandal investigation is their preferential treatment of Mills, he said. Mills was Clinton's chief of  staff at the State Department, an attorney in the administration of her husband President William J. Clinton and is now a member of the Clinton Foundation's board of directors.Howie Carr asked Sessions how is it that the former first lady could have Mills treated by the FBI and the Department of Justice as her attorney, while Clinton also had another team of lawyers from Williams and Connolly.The efforts to cover up and protect everyone involved in the email scandal were blatant, Carr said. ""Richard Nixon never dreamed of doing things like this.""The Alabama senator said that benefit given to Mills was not justified.""It is really unhealthy,"" the senator said.""She should not be treated as a legitimate lawyer-she surely had a conflict of interest,"" he said. As it is understood in the Common Law, attorney-lawyer privilege protects communications between a lawyer and his client. But, there are limits on the privilege, so that it cannot be used to obstruct an investigation into a past or ongoing crime.Mills and the FBI set up an investigation process, where Mills was in a position to know everything that was going on as both a potential target, witness and attorney, who was granted privilege with other targets and witnesses and allowed to attend interviews between the FBI and other potential targets and witnesses.Sessions told Carr: ""I don't see how it is possible for someone so involved in a case that they refuse to provide testimony and information without a grant of immunity.""Mills must know she is in legal jeopardy, he said.""That suggests that they think a truthful and or a truthful production of documents could incriminate them-and then, she turns around and is the lawyer for another possible co-conspirator in this activity?"" he asked.""It is a breathtaking thing,"" the senator said.Sessions said Mills, who was Clinton's chief of staff at the State Department, then was granted attorney-lawyer privilege in regards to relationship with Clinton and was allowed to participate in FBI interviews with other individuals involved in the email scandal.""I really don't see how Congress can issue a subpoena for records and they then destroy those records,"" he said.""I am telling you that every business knows that if they get a subpoena for business records, and they destroy those records, they are subject to criminal prosecution and will be prosecuted,"" Sessions said. ""That's a high prosecution case.""SIGN UP"

What we are facing in America is the fact that women in many states have fewer rights to access basic health care. And again, I think it's really important that we be honest here about birth control.In February, Richards told Clinton supporters in Nevada that, because of Obamacare, 55 million women in the United States are obtaining birth control for free.Richards said ""until a pregnancy is viable"" women have the right to abort their babies.As CNSNews.com reports, on Tuesday Richards was campaigning for Hillary Clinton in Iowa and was asked to comment by Wagner about Clinton's statement that unborn children have no constitutional rights.In April, Clinton responded to The View co-host Paula Faris when asked about her comments that an unborn child has no constitutional rights:Under our law that is the case, Paula. I support Roe v. Wade because I think it is an important -- an important statement about the importance of a woman making this most difficult decision with consultation by whom she chooses: her doctor, her faith, her family. And under the law and under certainly that decision, that is the way we structure it.Planned Parenthood and its political allies claim abortion is a woman's right up until the baby's due date, and they consistently fight state and federal restrictions on late-term abortions. Although some states have restricted late-term abortions, pro-life organization Live Action observes all states allow abortion into the ninth month for certain exceptions, and eight states allow abortion until birth for any reason (Colorado, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington State).""While the abortion industry claims that late-term abortions are an insignificant number of abortions and they're only done because of a disability the baby has or to protect the life of the mother, the evidence says just the opposite,"" says Lila Rose, Live Action's president and founder.Noting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) report in 2012 that 1.3 percent of abortions were committed at 21 weeks' gestation and later, Rose adds, ""With nearly one million abortions annually in the U.S., abortionists are killing close to 13,000 children every year who are often fully developed and can survive outside the womb.""Research published by the Guttmacher Institute also finds that most late-term abortions were not done for medical reasons - as the abortion lobby often states. Fetal abnormalities ""make up a small minority"" of late-term abortions, and those for saving the life of the mother are even less.According to the study:Most women seeking later abortion fit at least one of five profiles: They were raising children alone, were depressed or using illicit substances, were in conflict with a male partner or experiencing domestic violence, had trouble deciding and then had access problems, or were young and nulliparous [never given birth].""The abortion industry denies the science of fetal development and continues to advocate for aborting fully developed, viable children who can feel the pain of the abortionist's needle that's used to kill them,"" Rose asserts.Planned Parenthood has been under congressional investigation for the past year following an undercover investigation that alleged its practice of harvesting the body parts of aborted babies for profit.I think it really, honestly that's not the problem we are facing in America. What we are facing in America is the fact that women in many states have fewer rights to access basic health care. And again, I think it's really important that we be honest here about birth control.Under our law that is the case, Paula. I support Roe v.

""So this book has gone through my computer many, many times. If it's a thriller, it's because I've really tried to make it accessible - make this book Guilty as Sin accessible to a large audience, because the message is very important.""Klein said that message, as the title makes clear, is: ""Hillary is guilty as sin, has been guilty as sin, and if she becomes president, you can bet your bottom dollar that her four years will be one Hillary Clinton scandal after another, because wherever they go, the Clintons trail scandal behind them.""Klein reviewed his history as a writer and editor, describing how he was ostracized from mainstream media after he began reporting extensively on the Clintons:When I was at the New York Times, and that's a long time ago - I left the New York Times, believe it or not, in 1988 - back then, the New York Times, it's hard to remember, it was a straight newspaper. It was not in the tank for the Democratic Party. It was a straight newspaper because the executive editor of the paper, Abe Rosenthal, had a famous saying: 'I don't care if you cover the circus, as long as you don't sleep with the elephants.' He meant by that, obviously, that you could cover the Democratic Party, that's fine, but you can't get into bed with these people. You have to have fairness, and distance, and detachment. That's the way it used to be, and that's the way I was, when I was there.Now, when I write about Hillary, and Bill, and the Clintons, and what they have been up to in this new book Guilty as Sin, I am bringing the same journalistic ethics to bear. These are facts in this book, and the facts speak for themselves - which is that Hillary in fact did jeopardize national security with her unsecure email server; that Barack Obama knew about it all along during her time as Secretary of State and didn't do anything about it, so he was complicit in this; that she and Bill Clinton don't even live in the same city, no less in the same house; and that Bill has his own little love nest down in Little Rock, in his library.Klein is well aware his findings will be challenged because he used anonymous sources. ""You can't write contemporary political books without using anonymous sources because people won't talk to you otherwise,"" he said, noting the mainstream press has few qualms about the technique when anonymous sources provide information damaging to Republicans.Marlow asked him to elaborate on Bill Clinton's presidential library, which Guilty as Sin describes as effectively a ""bachelor pad."" Klein claimed Clinton wanted to add a swimming pool to his already ""luxurious"" accommodations, but had to settle for foot massages and impromptu wet T-shirt contests when his request was denied:Well, basically, the national media has ignored Bill Clinton down in Little Rock, where he spends almost half his time. I went down there, and I interviewed two interns who worked there, and they were in their twenties. Both of them had been invited up to his penthouse apartment on the fifth floor of the William Jefferson Clinton Library, where he has his luxurious penthouse apartment that he uses for parties. Both of them have given Bill Clinton foot massages, no less. He kicks off his loafers and his socks, and they massage his feet.Now, he planned, and had an architect look into, building a swimming pool up there on the fifth floor, so that he could have naked pool parties, the way John F. Kennedy, his hero, used to have in the White House. And the National Archives said no way, we're not going to let you do that, so it never came to fruition. But he does, according to a source that I have who was at one of these parties with him, take out a garden hose from time to time and spray down these women, in kind of a wet T-shirt contest.Ed Klein's blog and newspaper work can be found at his website, EdwardKlein.com.

Both of them have given Bill Clinton foot massages, no less. He kicks off his loafers and his socks, and they massage his feet.
Now, he planned, and had an architect look into, building a swimming pool up there on the fifth floor, so that he could have naked pool parties, the way John F. Kennedy, his hero, used to have in the White House. And the National Archives said no way, we're not going to let you do that, so it never came to fruition. 
But he does, according to a source that I have who was at one of these parties with him, take out a garden hose from time to time and spray down these women, in kind of a wet T-shirt contest.SIGN UPSpeaking with Breitbart Editor-in-Chief and SiriusXM host Alex Marlow, Klein said his new book ""may sound like an easy read,"" but he conducted ""a huge amount of research"" for it, including ""well over two, three hundred interviews.""""And then of course, as Nora Ephron, the now late Nora Ephron used to say, 'all good writing is rewriting,'"" he added. ""So this book has gone through my computer many, many times. If it's a thriller, it's because I've really tried to make it accessible - make this book Guilty as Sin accessible to a large audience, because the message is very important.""Klein said that message, as the title makes clear, is: ""Hillary is guilty as sin, has been guilty as sin, and if she becomes president, you can bet your bottom dollar that her four years will be one Hillary Clinton scandal after another, because wherever they go, the Clintons trail scandal behind them.""Klein reviewed his history as a writer and editor, describing how he was ostracized from mainstream media after he began reporting extensively on the Clintons:When I was at the New York Times, and that's a long time ago - I left the believe it or not, in 1988 - back then, the it's hard to remember, it was a straight newspaper. It was not in the tank for the Democratic Party. It was a straight newspaper because the executive editor of the paper, Abe Rosenthal, had a famous saying: 'I don't care if you cover the circus, as long as you don't sleep with the elephants.' He meant by that, obviously, that you could cover the Democratic Party, that's fine, but you can't get into bed with these people. You have to have fairness, and distance, and detachment. That's the way it used to be, and that's the way I was, when I was there.Now, when I write about Hillary, and Bill, and the Clintons, and what they have been up to in this new book Guilty as Sin, I am bringing the same journalistic ethics to bear. These are facts in this book, and the facts speak for themselves - which is that Hillary in fact did jeopardize national security with her unsecure email server; that Barack Obama knew about it all along during her time as Secretary of State and didn't do anything about it, so he was complicit in this; that she and Bill Clinton don't even live in the same city, no less in the same house; and that Bill has his own little love nest down in Little Rock, in his library.Klein is well aware his findings will be challenged because he used anonymous sources. ""You can't write contemporary political books without using anonymous sources because people won't talk to you otherwise,"" he said, noting the mainstream press has few qualms about the technique when anonymous sources provide information damaging to Republicans.Marlow asked him to elaborate on Bill Clinton's presidential library, which describes as effectively a ""bachelor pad."" Klein claimed Clinton wanted to add a swimming pool to his already ""luxurious"" accommodations, but had to settle for foot massages and impromptu wet T-shirt contests when his request was denied:claimed Clinton wanted to add a swimming pool to his already ""luxurious"" accommodations, but had to settle for foot massages and impromptu wet T-shirt contests when his request was denied:Well, basically, the national media has ignored Bill Clinton down in Little Rock, where he spends almost half his time. I went down there, and I interviewed two interns who worked there, and they were in their twenties. Both of them had been invited up to his penthouse apartment on the fifth floor of the William Jefferson Clinton Library, where he has his luxurious penthouse apartment that he uses for parties.

He is also the director of the Yasser Arafat Foundation, established after his uncle's death in 2004.Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, Jordan's King Abdullah II, and representatives from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have all spoken to Abbas, urging him to name a successor in the event of his resignation or if he is deemed unable to continue in office.All four nations assured Abbas that his children will be protected when he leaves his position.Former Fatah strongman Mohammad Dahlan, once considered the favored candidate to take over the PA, is not likely to be selected, the report said. Dahlan was ousted from Fatah in 2011 following allegations of corruption and murder, and now lives in the United Arab Emirates.In recent months Abbas and Dahlan had been engaged in reconciliation talks in an attempt to prevent Hamas from gaining power ahead of elections in the West Bank and Gaza.However, last week Breitbart Jerusalem reported that Dahlan allegedly told an Egyptian official that Abbas was a ""camel"" for regurgitating old ideas.Abbas is approaching his twelfth year as president even though his term ended in 2009. There have not been elections since 2005.On Tuesday, the Palestinian Authority announced that it was suspending municipal elections until further notice. A day earlier, the PA's High Court said elections would only go ahead in the West Bank and not the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, prompting the Palestinian Central Elections Commission to call on Abbas to delay the elections for at least six months, or until Gaza could be included.The last municipal elections between the two parties occurred in 2006 with Hamas winning, leading to a melee in the Strip bordering on civil war.SIGN UP"

Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have expressed support for humanitarian safe zones in northern Syria that would require kinetic action to protect them from Assad or Russian forces. According to the president's national security adviser, Susan Rice, such a policy would require tens of thousands of U.S. ground troops but would greatly ease the burden of refugees on Europe.Ahead of meetings of the Principal Committee and the National Security Council in which current U.S. policy regarding Syria will be reassessed, Russia this week deployed more sophisticated anti-aircraft and anti-missile batteries in Syria.According to a spokesperson for the State Department, all options are on the table now that Washington has suspended lines of communication with Moscow over the Syrian conflict.SIGN UP"

Set to Elect Another ‘Secular Pope’; Hillary Clinton Will ‘Play Right into His Hands’	"Former U.N. ambassador and American Enterprise Institute Senior Fellow John Bolton joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Thursday's Breitbart News Daily to review the vice presidential debate from a national security perspective.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""I thought there was more discussion, more serious discussion, of national security issues in the VP debate than there was in the first presidential debate,"" said Bolton. ""No thanks to the moderator, really, and no thanks to Tim Kaine of the Democratic ticket. It struck me he was going for the Ankle-Biter of the Year Award, with his approach to the debate.""""Mike Pence did a great job. I think he's almost universally conceded to have been the winner, and in large part, it's because on national security he showed the kind of calm, responsible, but strong position that I think reflects the mainstream views in the Republican Party,"" Bolton offered, adding:That should give comfort, I think, to people who are still undecided at the top of the ticket, that Mike Pence is a very steady voice, and he spoke very sensibly and knowledgeably - as opposed to Tim Kaine, who, honestly, looked not just on national security, but on many fronts, like he was repeating memorized talking points, not reflecting his own thinking on some of these subjects.Bolton agreed with Marlow's contention that Tim Kaine's claim that Hillary Clinton had somehow shut down Iran's nuclear program was one of the most outrageous ""whoppers"" of the night:I think it shows that where his brain ought to be on national security, there's a big vacuum. I mean, this is a claim that's not even closely related to reality, and I think it really underlines one of the vulnerabilities of the Democratic ticket. One of the key points I think Trump needs to make in the second and third debates: Hillary Clinton will be Barack Obama's third term. That's true on national security. It's also true on domestic issues, while we're on the subject. But for those conservatives and Republicans who have been saying, or some who have succumbed to the belief that somehow Hillary is closer to the mainstream Republican view of American foreign policy than Trump is, they really need to think again. These kinds of vacuous statements by Tim Kaine on the Iran deal, I think underline that. That deal was a strategic defeat for the United States when it was agreed to. It hasn't gotten any better in the past year. Iran has not changed its behavior internationally. There's every reason to believe that they've been violating the deal since before the ink was dry. We have German intelligence publishing reports already that point in that direction. We don't know how much cooperation they have with North Korea, also an aspiring nuclear power. But we do know that Iran's ballistic missile program, out in public view, has proceeded unimpeded, and the purpose of those ballistic missiles is not to launch weather satellites; it's to launch nuclear warheads towards targets on other continents - i.e. North America.So the rosy scenario that Tim Kaine tried to portray, I don't think has any purchase in the general public, and, as I say, it should be used politically to underline the point that Hillary will be Barack Obama's third term on foreign policy.Bolton said Kaine's contention that ""in a lot of ways, the terror threat has decreased in the Obama years"" was ""flatly contradicted by senior officials appointed by Barack Obama"":The director of National Intelligence, the director of the CIA, have both testified repeatedly, in open public sessions of Congress within the past few months, that the international terrorist is equal to or greater than it was on 9/11. There's no doubt in my mind that when George W. Bush left office, it was significantly lower.It's obviously increased the spread of ISIS and other terrorist groups, the collapse of state government across North Africa and the Middle East, the descent of nearly the whole region into anarchy, the spreading number and scope of terrorist attacks in Western Europe and the United States. Really, you just have to be awake to see this; you don't have to be an intelligence expert. So I would add the claim that the terrorist threat has been reduced to the claim that the Iran nuclear deal is a big success. It's another glaring error, a glaring indication that these people don't see the world as it is, which is the absolute prerequisite for developing a foreign policy to deal with these threats and challenges.Bolton addressed the two terrorist attacks in Brussels on Wednesday:If those attacks had occurred in the United States, we would have heard them described as ""lone wolf"" attacks. The description of the person would not have been made public; it just would have been a ""young male."" They would not have said that he was shouting, ""Allahu akbar!"" It would have been repressed, and then it would have been explained as not something to get upset about.The fact is that the terrorist threat is changing and evolving all the time, but we should not expect it at all levels to look like it's the product of a corporate decision-making process, pursuant to a nice box and line organization chart on some wall somewhere.Indeed, what I think these individual terrorist attacks, sometimes suicide bombers, as is tragically the case in Israel, carrying explosive vests. Sometimes, it's gun attacks. Sometimes, it's knife attacks. The fact that they are random, they are unexpected, the police can't predict them to prevent them in advance, sort of like what we saw in New York and New Jersey a couple of weeks ago at the opening of the U.N. General Assembly. That shows that the terrorist threat can appear anywhere, any time. It can be a city in the middle of the United States, a small town as in France. It can be in a city well removed from Paris, where a monk is killed while giving mass in a church. That is the kind of terror attack that actually inspires more fear in people because it's so unexpected. It's so unpredicted. It occurs in such unexpected places. The only way you're ever going to deal with this threat comprehensively is to treat it for what it is, which is a radical ideology that needs to be opposed as such. The United States did that twice in the twentieth century, against fascism and against communism. We can do it again. We can have allies in the Muslim world who understand that the radical Islamic terrorists are as much, or even greater, threats to them as they are to the West.But we're not going to do it with a president who won't acknowledge the ideology, can't see it in his worldview, in any event thinks that the exercise of American power very often is more the cause of instability in the world than the cure for it.Marlow asked for Bolton's opinion, as a former U.N. ambassador, of former Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres, who is likely to be the next U.N. secretary-general.""I met with him a couple of times when I was U.N. Ambassador, right when he was beginning his tenure as the U.N. high commissioner for refugees,"" Bolton recalled, continuing:He is a former socialist Prime Minister of Portugal, a great believer in the European Union. And I recall in our first conversation, as he was heading the High Commissioner Office for Refugees, he told me how much he was worried about ""populism"" in the Western world - which he defined as ""people who wanted control of their own borders."" And so we had, as they say, a polite exchange of views on that subject.""I think he's gonna bring that same attitude into the U.N.,"" Bolton predicted. He added:I think it's possible he will be very different from Ban Ki-moon, the outgoing secretary-general, who we did elect in 2006 for the first time, precisely because we didn't think he would try to be a ""secular Pope,"" as Kofi Annan, his predecessor, had been described. I think Guterres - we'll have to see how it plays out - but I think he may be more in the model of Kofi Annan than Ban Ki-moon, which would be a problem.He said Guterres was a ""done deal"" as secretary-general, so ""the only thing we can do is elect Donald Trump because if we elect Hillary Clinton, she'll play right into his hands.""Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.LISTEN:That should give comfort, I think, to people who are still undecided at the top of the ticket, that Mike Pence is a very steady voice, and he spoke very sensibly and knowledgeably - as opposed to Tim Kaine, who, honestly, looked not just on national security, but on many fronts, like he was repeating memorized talking points, not reflecting his own thinking on some of these subjects.I think it shows that where his brain ought to be on national security, there's a big vacuum.

Ambassador, right when he was beginning his tenure as the U.N. high commissioner for refugees,"" Bolton recalled, continuing:He is a former socialist Prime Minister of Portugal, a great believer in the European Union. And I recall in our first conversation, as he was heading the High Commissioner Office for Refugees, he told me how much he was worried about ""populism"" in the Western world - which he defined as ""people who wanted control of their own borders."" And so we had, as they say, a polite exchange of views on that subject.""I think he's gonna bring that same attitude into the U.N.,"" Bolton predicted. He added:I think it's possible he will be very different from Ban Ki-moon, the outgoing secretary-general, who we did elect in 2006 for the first time, precisely because we didn't think he would try to be a ""secular Pope,"" as Kofi Annan, his predecessor, had been described. I think Guterres - we'll have to see how it plays out - but I think he may be more in the model of Kofi Annan than Ban Ki-moon, which would be a problem.He said Guterres was a ""done deal"" as secretary-general, so ""the only thing we can do is elect Donald Trump because if we elect Hillary Clinton, she'll play right into his hands."""

After clearing paperwork, the family was being escorted to their next flight, when a U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer noticed Dieme unresponsive.Emergency Medical Services was immediately notified and arrived at the terminal. Standard procedures are in place to address sick passengers, according to a spokesman for the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention. Dieme was sick prior to the flight, but did not report any symptoms on the flight. He was examined at the airport by CDC officials, in an isolated room. Dieme's temperature was taken, but he had no fever. He experienced diarrhea and vomiting. It was determined he should be taken to the hospital.Dieme was taken to Presence Resurrection Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.The boy and his family were apparently not yet counted among the 2,058 refugees who have arrived in the United States in the first five days of FY 2017, a run rate that will double the number of arriving refugees to 150,000 this year, up from 84,995 in FY 2016.The Chicago CBS affiliate added:The CDC spokesman said it has been determined the child did not have a disease that posed a threat to public health. If more information comes forward that results in contacting passengers, action will be taken.U.S. Customs and Border Protection is deeply saddened with the situation. The family was passing through Chicago and planned to settle in Texas.The Cook County Medical Examiner is currently gathering additional information at this time. An autopsy was performed Wednesday, with results pending.During the first five days of FY 2017, 220 refugees have been resettled in Texas, more than any other state in the country.Ninety-nine of those refugees arrived from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, according to the Department of State's interactive website.Thirty-nine were resettled in Houston, 25 in Dallas, nine in Abilene, nine in Amarillo, eight in Fort Worth, eight in San Antonio, and one in Austin.In September, Gov. Greg Abbott announced that Texas was withdrawing from the federal refugee resettlement program, effective in January.Breitbart News has reported extensively on the public health risk to the general public posed by a resurgence of diseases that had been on a path to eradication until the recent influx of migration to the country. Among the diseases newly resurgent are tuberculosis, whooping cough, intestinal parasites, mumps, and measles.Refugees are required to undergo overseas medical screenings prior to their arrival in the United States. Those screenings, however, do not prohibit refugees with a number of diseases from arriving in the United States. Few arriving refugees, for instance,  are tested and treated for latent tuberculosis infection prior to their arrival in the United States.Though initial domestic medical screenings of all arriving refugees are recommended within ninety days of their arrival, those screenings are not required by either law or regulation.David Dieme, an 8-year-old boy landed Tuesday at approximately 4:30 p.m. with a refugee family at O'Hare International Airport.

We are talking about the old city in particular,"" de Mistura told a news conference in Geneva.""There is only one thing we are not ready to do: be passive, resign ourselves to another Srebrenica, another Rwanda, which we are sadly ready to recognise written on that wall in front of us, unless something takes place,"" he said.Syrian government forces seized around half of a key opposition-held neighbourhood in Aleppo on Thursday in a new advance against rebels, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said.De Mistura said that there were a maximum of 8,000 fighters in eastern Aleppo, including those formerly known as Nusra Front, who have renamed themselves as Jabhat Fateh al Sham. At least 200 wounded civilians needed medical evacuation to save their lives.The veteran diplomat addressed his plea directly to the former Nusra fighters: ""And if you did decide to leave, in dignity with your weapons, to Idlib or anywhere you wanted to go, I personally am ready, physically ready, to accompany you.""Addressing himself to the Russians and the Syrian government, he asked: ""Are you really ready to continue this type of level of fighting using that type of weapons, and de facto destroy the whole city of eastern Aleppo ... which is home to 275,000 people for the sake of eliminating 1,000 al Nusra fighters?""The alternative was an immediate halt in the bombing in response to the Nusra fighters' departure, which would leave the local administration in place.The U.N. should then be allowed to reach the population with humanitarian medical aid.SIGN UP"
