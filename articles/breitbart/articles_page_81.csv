We got a double whammy recently because of the increase in handgun sales."" Store manager Guy Hanson pointed to the case that holds concealable handguns and said, ""We usually have a lot more than this. This case isn't even full.""The demand for personal protection has led to a run on the guns.Demand for concealed carry permits has witnessed a similar boost. Anacortes Police Chief Bonnie Bowers released a statement indicating the demand for concealed carry permits is ""eight times"" as high as it was prior to the mall attack. And Lin Tucker, Sedro-Woolley police chief, said his department tied a one-day record for concealed permit applications in the immediate aftermath of the attack on Cascade Mall.Tucker described demand as ""through the roof.""Anacortes resident Mary Parker was one of the residents seeking a concealed carry permit after the attack. She said, ""I want to make sure it would never happen to me and that if it did, I would be prepared. I want to be in a place where I will never be afraid.""AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

For example, new federal rules now urge punishment for K-12 students who refuse to use the female pronoun -'her"" -- when referring a male classmate who dresses like a girl, or who do not want to share a bathroom with members of the opposite sex.Lang notes that this past weekend, Francis referred to teaching gender theory in schools as ""ideological colonization.""During his short trip to the Caucasus, Pope Francis also called gender theory a ""great enemy"" of marriage, adding that the ideology of gender is part of a global war of ideas out to destroy traditional marriage.In an extended, off-the-cuff speech in Georgia, Francis said that today we are witnessing a ""global war to destroy marriage"" in which gender theory places a key role, fighting ""not with weapons, but with ideas.""But although the Pope's stern opposition to gender theory may strike Nico Lang as a novelty, in point of fact, it is nothing new.For years the Pope has been an outspoken critic of LGBT agitators' efforts to impose same-sex marriage on society along with theories of gender fluidity that divorce gender from biological sexual differences.In March, Francis published an extensive teaching letter on marriage and the family called The Joy of Love (Amoris Laetitia), in which he underscored the unique roles of motherhood and fatherhood, and called same-sex marriage legislation the ""legal deconstruction of the family.""In that same text, Francis slammed gender theory for its denial of ""the difference and reciprocity in nature of a man and a woman,"" and for its dream of ""a society without sexual differences.""""An appreciation of our body as male or female,"" he said, is ""necessary for our own self-awareness in an encounter with others different from ourselves."" Efforts to erase sexual differences based in biology are a symptom of a sick society that ""no longer knows how to deal with it,"" he wrote.In the past, Francis has used even stronger language to denounce gender theory. In early 2014, the Pope called modern gender ideology ""demonic,"" and compared the teaching of gender theory to children with the educational policies of Hitler.In his Salon article, Lang declares that the pope's message on transgender ""boils down the old canard that the Catholic Church has been using against gays and lesbians for decades: 'Love the sinner, hate the sin.'""The Pope's ideas are ""biblically inaccurate"" and outdated, Lang insists.If loving sinners and hating sin is a ""canard,"" at least the Pope has Jesus on his side--even if Salon is no longer a fan.Follow Thomas D.

Trump as he climbs to a virtual tie with Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Badger State in the latest Breitbart News Network/Gravis Marketing survey.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe poll of 1,102 registered voters in Wisconsin finds Trump just three points back, right on the poll's margin of error of three percent. Trump is at 43 percent compared to Clinton's 46 percent in the survey conducted on Oct. 4, meaning the race is a statistical tie.The tightening of the Wisconsin race comes as U.S. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan hits the trail on Saturday to campaign with Trump at Ryan's ""1st Congressional District Republican Party of Wisconsin Fall Fest"" at the Walworth County Fairgrounds. A source close to the planning of the event said Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. joins the event as the guest of Trump. Several other senior Wisconsin Republicans, like the state's GOP governor and former Trump rival Scott Walker-who has since endorsed Trump over Clinton for president-and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) will be present as well.Democratic pollster Patrick Caddell told Breitbart News that the 2016 election is still very volatile, so to better measure voter presidential preferences, respondents were asked the question of who they would vote for twice. The first time came in the middle of the survey after some attitudinal questions about the respondents' thoughts on the candidates and general mood, and then at the end of the survey after being asked about several key issues in the 2016 race before asking demographic questions.In the first asking, Clinton led Trump with 48 percent to his 40 percent, Libertarian Gary Johnson was the choice of four percent, and Green Party nominee Jill Stein came in at one percent, he said. Johnson and Stein were unchanged. In the second, however, with the same sample, Trump moved up to 43 percent and Clinton dropped to 46 percent.Caddell said the reason in the second asking Trump picked up five points is that the voters in Wisconsin, like elsewhere, are not settled.""It is so important to remember, the voters, the people are not settled like the pundits or the candidates are settled,"" Caddell said. ""They are still getting to their decision point. These are the decisions that come to a head inside the voting booth or wherever they make up their mind.""But, after having to consider questions about the economy, the U.S. handing over control of the Internet, bringing in more refugees or the performance of Obamacare, voters moved from supporting the former first lady to supporting the New York City developer, he said.When they were asked if Obamacare was a ""success,"" 50 percent said no and 39 percent said it was a success.Wisconsin voters were asked: The United States will relinquish its administrative control over the Internet to a private organization where other countries, which could include China, Russia and Iran, will have influence for the first time on the management of the Internet. Do you think this is a good idea or not? Seventy percent of the respondents said it was a bad idea and only five percent said it was a good idea.Caddell said this question about the control of the Internet exposes how out of touch the Republican leadership in Washington, D.C. have become.""If this had been raised, if this had been made into an issue, it would have would have helped every Republican and it would have hurt every Democrat-but, once again, like everything else-they caved on it,"" he said.""These are what I call 'saliency' issues,"" Caddell said. ""There are a lot latent attitudes and when they get sparked they become salient, more important, like with the refugees-if Trump was smart, he'd see-Americans are for his postion and they are against Obama and Clinton's position on refugees.""Badger State voters were asked: Hillary Clinton's supporters at the Refugee Council want to increase the number of refugees coming into the United States in 2017 even more, to 200,000, and Hillary wants to increase the number of Syrian refugees in that total from 10,000 in 2016 to 65,000 in 2017. Do you approve or disapprove of this increase?Wisconsin voters disapprove of this plan 62 percent to 25 percent in this poll.Trump needs to make the refugee issue a front and center part of the discussion about what is going wrong in the country, just like he did with trade and the economy, so that Clinton cannot any longer fail to mention these issues, Caddell said.Caddell, who is a Fox News Insider, said both nationally and in Wisconsin the only way Clinton wins is if she makes it a head-to-head contest between her and Trump on personality concerns. But, if Trump can make the election turn on the issues-a referendum, so to speak-voters will see that he is lined up where they are and make him the president, he said.Pete Meachum, Wisconsin state director for Trump's campaign, told Breitbart News the election will turn on the economy.""Wisconsin's workers want to win for Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton can't connect with middle class voters because they simply cannot trust her,"" he said.""Donald Trump is the only candidate that will put Wisconsin first by creating jobs, restoring law and order and bringing prosperity back after eight years of failed economic policies that have plagued this country,"" he said.Wisconsin State Senate Majority Leader Scott L. Fitzgerald (R.-Juneau) told Breitbart News he is convinced Wisconsin is in play for Trump from the field reports he is receiving from other state senators and candidates.""This time around, there are a lot of targeted Senate seats,"" he said. ""As we do our senate polling across the state, his numbers kept getting strong and then it was just a matter of time.""""I guess we were all caught off guard, when we didn't see that the rural areas of Wisconsin, up north and out west, would break as hard as they did for Donald Trump, but we've been watching it,"" he said.People who voted for Ted Cruz April 15 in the primary are starting to face the reality of having to choose between Trump and Clinton, he said. Wisconsin was in many ways one of the ground zeros-along with Colorado, where Trump is also surging-of the so-called now essentially defunct ""Never Trump movement"" during the GOP presidential primaries. It was the last state that Trump didn't win, where Cruz made his last stand. But now, Fitzgerald and others tell Breitbart News, Wisconsin is drifting into Trump's corner slowly but surely in the final weeks of the campaign.""For Republicans, it is a clear choice,"" Fitzgerald said.Doug Kaplan, the managing partner of Gravis Marketing, the Florida-based firm that conducted the poll, said that Trump may shock the political world with a potential Wisconsin win on Nov. 8.""Everyone treats Wisconsin as a lock for the Democrats, but Gov. Scott Walker is a very controversial Republican won there in 2010, his recall in 2012 and was reelected in 2014,"" Kaplan said.""In the presidential races, the Democrats have had an easier time, but to say that and ignore GOP wins statewide,' Kaplan added.In 2012, President Barack Obama beat his GOP opponent Mitt Romney with 53 percent of the vote to Romney's 46 percent, he said. In 2008, it was not as close when Obama beat Sen. John S. McCain III (R.-Ariz.) with 56 percent to the former fighter pilot's 42 percent.The poll was conducted with random automated phone calls. Results were weighted to match a proprietary turnout model. The poll carries a margin of error of three percent with a 95 percent level of confidence.Wisconsin Polling Oct 5 by Breitbart News on ScribdSIGN UP"

Chuck Grassley is asking U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE) Director Sarah Saldana why an illegal alien with a violent criminal history who lied to law enforcement was permitted to remain in the U.S. until he allegedly murdered five people.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe illegal alien had been arrested in 2012 near the Southern California border for breaking into the country, but released a week later they released him, even though he lied to them about his age so he could be processed as an ""unaccompanied minor."" He stopped checking in with ICE in 2014.Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Virginia Kice explained ICE shrugged off the illegal alien's disappearance, saying the agency only ""focus[es] on individuals who pose a public safety threat."" The Obama administration's ""priority enforcement program,"" which ICE follows, dramatically slashed enforcement operations, resulting in a record low in overall deportations and deportations of illegal aliens who went on to commit more crimes in the U.S.Johnny Josue Sanchez, 21, an illegal alien from Honduras was arrested for setting fire to a building where homeless people lived in Los Angeles. In June, Sanchez allegedly ""started the fire to avenge a beating he took in a dispute over occupying a room"" according to the Los Angeles Times. Grassley sent Saldana a series of questions, inquiring why the violent illegal alien was ignored by ICE until he allegedly killed five people:Why did ICE release Yoni Josue Sanchez on November 13, 2012, after he had lied to Border Patrol agents about his birth date?What is ICE's written policy about how to handle individuals who are apprehended by U.S. Border Patrol for illegal entry but have lied about their date of birth in order to be processed as a juvenile and be released?How many individuals in fiscal years 2015 and 2016 have been determined to have lied about their birth date but were later confirmed not to be a juvenile?When Sanchez was interviewed upon entry, he claimed he had family members in the country and that he traveled from Honduras with a brother and cousin.

The state of California is also a sanctuary state, allowing local law enforcement to refuse ICE detainer requests unless the illegal alien in question meets a set of criteria.Sanchez may face the death penalty if convicted on the murder charges.Why did ICE release Yoni Josue Sanchez on November 13, 2012, after he had lied to Border Patrol agents about his birth date?

Trump each have the support of 46 percent of the electorate, according to the Oct. 4 Breitbart News Network/Gravis Marketing poll of 821 registered voters in the Sunshine State.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERDemocratic pollster Patrick Caddell told Breitbart News the election is still very much in flux in 2016.""The race between Clinton and Trump is very unstable,"" he said.Caddell said to better measure the mood of the voters, the presidential preference was asked twice. The first time was in the middle of the survey after a series of general political questions mostly about favorability. The second was later in the survey after asking more issue-focused questions before asking demographic questions at the end.In the first asking, Clinton led Trump with 47 percent to his 45 percent, Caddell said.""Then, after finishing the survey with a number of attitudinal questions, the respondents were asked again, giving us the 46 percent-to-46 percent tie,"" he said.""Clearly, when we get into some of these policy issues, such as the economy, trade, and increasingly bringing in more refugees-when people focus on these issues, they find themselves agreeing with Trump and not agreeing with Clinton,"" he said.""It is so important to remember, the voters, the people are not settled like the pundits or the candidates are settled,"" Caddell said. ""Certainly, it is true in Florida.""""Our poll confirms that Florida is the still one of the tightest races between Clinton and Trump,"" said Doug Kaplan, the managing partner of Gravis Marketing, the Florida-based polling company that conducted the poll. The poll carries a 3.4 percent margin of error with a 95 percent level of confidence. That margin of error means that even when looking at the survey's first asking on the presidential preference question, it's still a statistical tie.""With the race within the margin of error, it could still break one way or the other,"" Kaplan said. ""Florida was the closest finish in 2012 and it could go that way in 2016.""Florida has 29 votes in the Electoral College, critical to either Clinton's or Trump's path to the White House.In the 2012 campaign, President Barack Obama beat his GOP rival Mitt Romney by less than 74,305 votes with a finish of 50 percent to Romney's 49 percent.In this Breitbart/Gravis poll, Libertarian Gary Johnson has the support of two percent of the electorate and Green Party nominee Dr. Jill Stein has one percent.Clinton leads with 55 percent of women voters to Trump's 39 percent.Trump leads with 53 percent of male voters to Clinton's 38 percent.Inside their own parties, both have consolidated support.Eighty-seven percent of Democrats support Clinton, while only seven percent of Republicans back her. Trump has the support of 81 percent of Republicans with 10 percent of Democrats.A source familiar with the Republican National Committee's get-out-the-vote effort in Florida told Breitbart News the party is working hand-in-glove with the Trump campaign.The source said the party rebuilt its GOTV organization in 2013 based on lessons learned from 2012 and has devoted resources to a ""permanent ground game"" in key battleground states, such at Florida.""Republicans in Florida have requested more than 335,000 absentee ballots than they did in 2012,"" the source said. ""That is a 84,435 advantage over what the Democrats have requested.""The Florida Senate race is also very close. Former presidential candidate Republican Sen. Marco Rubio holds a small lead just outside the margin of error over his Democratic challenger Rep. Patrick Murphy. Rubio is at 44 percent of the electorate, while Murphy is at 40 percent. Rubio's tight lead should be considered in the context of the 16 percent of respondents who said they were unsure.Another clue to how the electorate will break in November is the favorability opinions. Twenty-five percent have a strongly unfavorable opinion of the congressman with 13 percent have a strongly favorable opinion. With Rubio, meanwhile, 44 percent of the electorate has a strongly unfavorable opinion of him compared to 19 percent with a strongly favorable opinion.Caddell said Rubio's high unfavorables combined with the 16 percent undecided cannot be ignored.""I don't know about the individual dynamics of that race, but it is fascinating to me,"" he said.""Rubio's lead is there, but that race is not over despite what everyone is saying.""The poll was conducted Oct. 4 with random automated phone calls, and results were weighted to match a proprietary turnout model.Current Florida Polling by Breitbart News on ScribdSIGN UP"

""Despite the clinical evidence of an influence of hormonal contraception on some women's mood, associations between the use of hormonal contraception and mood disturbances remain inadequately addressed.""The authors conducted a nationwide cohort study of data for 1,061,997 Danish women and adolescents, aged 15 to 34 years, to determine if the use of hormonal contraception is linked to subsequent use of antidepressants or depression diagnosis. The women were assigned to two different groups: users and nonusers of hormonal contraceptives. They were followed for 13 years and data regarding any depression diagnoses and prescriptions for antidepressant medications were collected from the period of January 1, 1995 to December 31, 2013, and analyzed.Results showed that, compared to nonusers, women who used the commonly prescribed combination birth control pills - containing both estrogen and progestin - were 23 percent more likely to have been prescribed an antidepressant. Users of the progestin-only birth control pill were 34 percent more likely to be described an antidepressant.Other forms of hormonal birth control showed a link to even higher risks of depression diagnosis. Compared to women not using contraception, for those using progestin-only IUDs (levonorgestrel), the rate of antidepressant prescriptions increased by 40 percent. For women using a vaginal ring (etonogestrel), antidepressant prescription increased by 60 percent, and up to 100 percent for women using a hormonal patch (norgestrolmin).The authors note that teen girls were 80 percent more likely to be prescribed an antidepressant when also prescribed the combination birth control pill, and 120 percent more likely when using progestin-only pills. Additionally, the risk for teens using non-oral hormonal contraception tripled.""Use of hormonal contraception, especially among adolescents, was associated with subsequent use of antidepressants and a first diagnosis of depression, suggesting depression as a potential adverse effect of hormonal contraceptive use,"" the study concluded.The authors say that while the study's large sample size, and the fact that it excluded women with a prior depression diagnosis, are its strengths, they also note that some depressed women are undiagnosed or are not treated with antidepressants. In addition, antidepressants are sometimes prescribed for conditions other than depression.Lead author Ojvind Lidegaard, MD tells Health.com more research is needed to evaluate whether depression is indeed a side effect of hormonal birth control.""Women who develop depression after starting on oral contraceptives should consider this use as a contributing factor,"" he says, adding that ""doctors should include these aspects together with other risks and benefits with use of hormonal contraceptives, when they advise women to which type of contraception is the most suitable for that specific woman.""Lidegaard continues that teen girls are most vulnerable to the link between hormonal contraception and depression.""Doctors should ensure that women, especially young women, are not already depressed or have a history of depression,"" he says, ""and they should inform women about this potential risk.""SIGN UP"

Additionally, the Wall Street Journal notes that 13,000 manufacturing jobs in the United States were lost last month.The unemployment rate also rose from 4.9 percent to 5 percent.The Trump campaign's press release on Friday noted that the labor participation rate is at 62.9 percent, ""near a historic low.""""The overall unemployment rate is stuck at 9.7%.

Average wages rose only six cents in September and are barely keeping up with inflation. Almost a third of the jobs added in September - 51,000 jobs - are low-paying service jobs in sectors such as retail and restaurants that won't support a family, pay for a home or put children through college.""We see many jobs in services, and too few better-paying jobs making the goods Americans use and can export to the rest of world,"" Malpass explains.

Controversial enough that his appearance at the University of Alabama requires security that costs seven times what normally would be anticipated for similar events staged at the university.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROn Monday, Yiannopoulos is scheduled to give a speech at an event sponsored by the University of Alabama's College Republicans as part of his cross-country ""The Dangerous Faggot Tour.""The University of Alabama, however, has - without explicitly expressing opposition to the event - gone out of its way to prevent the event from happening.Gerald Fraas, treasurer of the University of Alabama College Republicans and who is spearheading the Yiannopoulos event, told Breitbart News their initial estimate was around $800-1,200. After ""a small conversation"" involving a University of Alabama Police Department official, the price of security for the event was then quoted as ""probably"" around $4,600-4,800.However on Wednesday, Fraas received a notice from University of Alabama Police Lt. Jeff Nabors, the special event planning coordinator of the university's police department, saying there would be a new price tag: $6,955.Breitbart News has obtained a copy of this email.Nathaniel White, the chairman of the College Republican Federation of Alabama, the organization overseeing the 20 College Republican chapters in Alabama, told Breitbart News they weren't seeking a ""security handout"" and expected a fee, but not such a high amount.""This event was set up months ago and we were told that there were going to be security fees and that we would be responsible for a few officers,"" White said. ""We're fine with that. Don't get me wrong, we're not asking for a security handout or anything like that. We're used to doing this at several other events throughout the state.""The College Republican group appears to be a victim of a tactic often used by colleges and universities to force cancellations of some events, which is to impose untenable ""security"" fees on a particular event. The tactic, however, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), is unconstitutional because those security fees ""function as a tax on protected speech.""""I know this happens on a number of college campuses,"" White said. ""I guess it's one of those things you never really think is going to happen to you until it does. This definitely happened to us.""White claims the University of Alabama Police Department raised the fee after series of ""microaggression protests"" by liberal groups around campus over the past several days. White said his organization was ""miffed"" about the initial nearly $5,000 fee, but shrugged it off and offered to pay it.""This is not a situation that should be happening and we feel like this is the university's way of trying to discourage us from hosting this event at all,"" White said.""The University police have actually been very uncooperative,"" he added. ""Honestly, they're being very horrible and unprofessional with communications. They haven't indicated if it's something that needs to be prepaid or if it's something that needs a deposit or payment. They've offered no real concrete way of dealing with this.""Regardless if the event is cancelled or if the group relents and pays the $7,000 fee, Fraas said he considers it a denial of freedom of speech.""Whether the University just shuts us down or forces us to pay a prohibitive security fee, they deny us our freedom of speech, and they deny the entire student body the right to hear Milo's message,"" Fraas said. ""No matter your opinion on the speaker, this is an act against our liberty, a Heckler's veto on speech.  We follow the rules of civil discourse, Milo's opponents threaten violence, so we get assessed an exorbitant fee and get shut down.  It seems to me it's the University's responsibility to provide an environment in which civil discourse is encouraged and the rights of all are protected, not just those with whom they agree.""Yiannopoulos also acknowledged the tactic, but argued it would backfire by giving him more attention.""College administrations, with a few honorable exceptions, will stop at nothing to torpedo my talks, and slapping extortionate security and event fees on students is easily among the lower, more slippery tools in their arsenal. I'm not sure what they hope to accomplish, beyond getting themselves in trouble and driving yet more attention to me.""White added that his College Republican chapter's adviser has reached out to the University Police with an offer to negotiate and have gotten no response. In addition to reaching out to the University of Alabama Police, White's organization also sought a response from the school's administration and has yet to get a response.Earlier on Thursday, Breitbart News requested a comment from the University of Alabama's interim director of media relations Chris Bryant and university communications specialist Richard LeComte. After not getting a response from Bryant or LeComte, Breitbart News sought comment from University of Alabama Vice President of Financial Affairs Dr. Lynda Gilbert, whose division oversees the university's police department.White said he had asked Sen. Jeff Sessions' (R-AL) office to also intervene in the dispute.""Sessions' office is very understanding of the situation,"" White said and added he is hoping a representative from his office would ""contact the university.""White told Breitbart News he didn't personally expect any problems at the Yiannopoulos event and that he heard some groups were looking to avoid the event altogether because any disruption would ""play into exactly what Milo wants.""The University of Alabama College Republicans have acquired legal counsel to assist them in the dispute with the University of Alabama. On Monday, John Eidsmoe, senior counsel for the Foundation for Moral Law of Montgomery, AL acting in conjunction with the Washington, DC-based Alliance Defending Freedom, sent a cease and desist letter to Michael I. Spearing, chief counsel for the University of Alabama, which insisted the fees constituted a ""heckler's veto"" and was described as an infringement on the University of Alabama College Republican's First Amendment rights.Breitbart News has obtained a copy of that letter.Download DocumentYiannopoulos is scheduled to make a similar appearance at the University of Alabama's in-state rival Auburn University on Friday. At Auburn, which is 160 miles away from Tuscaloosa on the opposite side of the state, the College Republican chapter is responsible for a $1,400 security fee.The Yiannopoulos event has faced backlash from within student body at the University of Alabama. Last month Alabama student newspaper Crimson White opinion editor Kyle Campbell decried Yiannopoulos' appearance.""[D]isinvite him because it's the right thing to do,"" Campbell wrote in a September 19 op-ed. ""Disinvite him because his rhetoric incites violence - a violence that will likely harm the most vulnerable students on our campus. Disinvite him to prove that the Capstone Creed is not a series of empty words, but a declaration of standards that all students must uphold. Our administration must play its part in stemming this nation's rolling tide of hatred, and that if that means banning a 31-year-old misogynistic child from campus, then so be it.Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poorSIGN UP"

Brownstein notes that Ryan stated his opposition to Trump's positions on entitlements, infrastructure, trade, foreign alliances, immigration and crime. Brownstein observes that while Trump's positions on these issues reflect the priorities of ""the party's growing blue-collar wing,"" Ryan's positions represent the donor-class interests of the ""party's business leadership"". Brownstein writes:""Ryan opposed most key components in the bristling insular populism that Trump used to build a winning primary coalition centered on working-class whites. Trump's enthusiasm for entitlement and infrastructure spending, his hostility to international trade and foreign alliances, and his provocative positions on immigration and crime, all reflect priorities of the party's growing blue-collar wing. Yet to Ryan, many other Republican legislators, and much of the party's business leadership, those positions are economically irresponsible, racially indefensible, and politically suicidal.""Below is the list of issues Brownstein highlights as areas where Ryan is still fighting Trump on policy.IMMIGRATIONBrownstein also noted that, with regards to illegal immigration, Ryan once again, ""rejected Trump's plan to accelerate deportation of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants: 'I think there is a way to deal with the undocumented population that doesn't involve mass deportation,' [Ryan said during their interview.]""Instead, Ryan expressed support for allowing people in the country to stay and acquire legal status that would allow them to take American jobs through the issuance of work permits.During the interview, Ryan described securing the border as a ""confidence building exercise"" for the American people that would eventually lead them to change their ""attitudes"" and ""embrace"" Congressional efforts to ""fix our broken immigration system""--i.e. legalize the illegal population.With regards to green card issuances, Brownstein writes: ""Ryan wasn't familiar with Trump's call to limit legal immigration to restrict the total share of the U.S. population born abroad, the speaker's initial reaction was skepticism: 'I've never looked at it like that.'""Ryan later made the case to Brownstein that rather than curbing immigration, the U.S. should bring in foreign workers to fill the jobs and skill-sets that American workers are not or ""cannot"" do.ENTITLEMENTSBrownstein observed that, ""when I asked if Ryan would drop his plan to convert Medicare into a premium support system or to reform Social Security because Trump has repeatedly said he opposes any changes in the programs, the speaker made clear he would not.""INFRASTRUCTUREBrownstein noted that Ryan was ""equally dismissive"" of Trump's proposals on infrastructure: ""'That's not in the Better Way agenda,' [Ryan] said, laughing.""CRIME""While Trump has stressed 'law and order,' Ryan reaffirmed his support for criminal-justice reform,"" Bernstein wrote. Conservative critics of Ryan's so-called ""criminal justice reform"" have described it as the Obama-Ryan ""jail break"" agenda.TRADEBrownstein asked Ryan about Trump's plan to renegotiate better trade deals for American workers--in particular, Trump's declaration that, ""I'm going to tell our NAFTA partners that I intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that agreement to get a better deal for our workers... If they do not agree to a renegotiation, then I will submit notice under Article 2205 of the NAFTA agreement that America intends to withdraw from the deal.""When Brownstein brought up Trump's negotiation strategy to pressure foreign trading partners to rework the terms of NAFTA to get a better deal for Americans, and asked Ryan if him if he would ""help [Trump] try to achieve withdrawing from NAFTA,"" Ryan laughed out loud.""I don't want to get into hypotheticals,"" Ryan said, still laughing.Ryan then touted his key involvement in crafting last year's Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation that was widely opposed by grassroots of both political parties. The measure ceded Congressional authority to President Obama by granting him the power to fast track trade agreements such as the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP). At the time--in fact, even before he announced his candidacy-- Trump described TPA as a ""disaster"" and another sign the ""country is going to hell"".""As you know, I wrote the trade promotion authority law so that we could go out and get trade agreements,"" Ryan told Brownstein. ""It's really important that open up export markets for ourselves. Ninety-five of the world's consumers live in the other countries, not this country, so we have to have trade.""Ryan's continued efforts to push the Republican donor-class' agenda of global trade comes despite the fact that a recent POLITICO Pro-Harvard poll found that nearly 9 out of 10 Republican voters- whom Ryan is supposed to represent- believe that these so-called ""free trade"" deals have cost the U.S. more jobs than they have created.""Ryan opposed most key components in the bristling insular populism that Trump used to build a winning primary coalition centered on working-class whites. Trump's enthusiasm for entitlement and infrastructure spending, his hostility to international trade and foreign alliances, and his provocative positions on immigration and crime, all reflect priorities of the party's growing blue-collar wing.

If that rate continues for the next 359 days of FY 2017, the Obama administration would resettle 185,000 refugees in the country, 75,000 more than the 110,000 he proposed to Congress for FY 2017, and 100,000 more than the 84,995 refugees resettled in FY 2016.News of the continued acceleration of refugee resettlement in the United States backs what critics of the federal refugee resettlement program have been telling Breitbart News for several months.""If Hillary Clinton is elected, she will be on a glide path to reach 200,000 refugees in FY 2017 easily.She can use emergency power under the Refugee Act to bring in more refugees than the 110,000 ceiling Obama presented to Congress,"" Ann Corcoran, founder of the Refugee Resettlement Watch blog, told Breitbart News on Thursday.""A Donald Trump administration could turn off the refugee spigot,"" Corcoran added.Hillary Clinton has previously stated she supports increasing the number of Syrian refugees annually resettled in the United States to 65,000.Though she has avoided making public statements about the number of total refugees she wants resettled annually, critics of the federal refugee resettlement program are convinced she supports the 200,000 annual level put forward by the Refugee Council USA, the lobbying arm of the politically powerful refugee resettlement industry, whose executives include a number of former Obama and Clinton administration appointees.Breitbart News reported previously that 2,058 refugees (subsequently restated by the Department of State as 2,131) were resettled during the first five days of FY 2017, a daily average of 411, which set the Obama administration on a pace to bring in more than 150,000 refugees  in FY 2017.In contrast, the daily average of arriving refugees in FY 2016, when 84,995 refugee were resettled in the United States, was 233 (see chart above).The acceleration of refugee resettlement is even more stunning if the first three days of October are compared to the next three days.As the chart above illustrates, no refugees were resettled on October 1, 10 were resettled on October 2, and 370 were resettled on October 3. Eight hundred and six refugees were resettled on October 4, 945 were resettled on October 5, and 931 were resettled on October 6, according to the most recent State Department reporting (see chart above).During the three day period between October 4 and October 6, 2,682 refugees were resettled in the United States. That's an average daily rate of 894 refugees for those three days. Should the Obama administration maintain that hyper-accelerated average for the remaining 359 days of FY 2017, it would end up resettling 325,000 refugees for the year, which would be a record high for the thirty-six year old program, which was initiated by the Refugee Act of 1980.Congress has not granted the Department of State, the Office of Refugee Resettlement, or the voluntary agencies (VOLAGs) in the lucrative and politically powerful refugee resettlement industry the budget authority to bring refugees in to the United States at the extraordinarily high pace at which the program has operated during the first six days of October.During FY 2016, which ended on September 30, Congress appropriated more than $1 billion, funds paid to the VOLAGs and their local affiliates to manage the refugee resettlement process at various locations across the country. Under that funding, the VOLAGs resettled 84,995 refugees, just five below the 85,000 ceiling President Obama proposed and Congress accepted for FY 2016.Though President Obama has proposed resettling a maximum of 110,000 refugees in FY 2017, Congress has not yet approved of that ceiling, nor has it appropriated 52 weeks of funding for the fiscal year that began on October 1. Instead, Congress has approved interim funding to cover just the first 10 weeks of FY 2017, which begin on October 1 and end on December 9.It is unclear whether that funding is at the 85,000 refugee annual level of FY 2016  or at the 110,000 annual level proposed by President Obama for FY 2017 but not yet either approved or rejected by Congress.During the first six days of October, the Department of State, the Office of Refugee Resettlement, and the VOLAGs have far exceeded their current budget authority to bring in refugees.Operating at the 85,000 annualized level, which equals 233 refugees per day, they would have so far brought in only 1,398 refugees, 1,660 fewer than the 3,062 who have arrived. Operating at the 110,000 annualized level, which equals 301 refugees per day, they would have so far brought in only 1,806 refugees, 1,256 fewer than the 3,062 who have arrived.***UPDATEAt noon eastern on Friday October 7, the Department of State's interactive website provided new numbers for refugees resettled month-to-date for October 2016 in the United States.The number of refugees resettled on Thursday, October 6 was increased to 975 from 931.The number of refugees resettled during the six day period beginning October 1 and ending October 6 was increased to 3,106 from 3,062. This increases the average number of refugees resettled during the first six days of FY 2017 to 517, up from 510.SIGN UP"

The survey noted that those skeptical of man's influence on global warming aren't science illiterate, a favorite talking point of the far left.Overall, Pew's research finds that only 33 percent of U.S. adults think climatologists understand ""very well"" whether the climate is changing, and only 19 percent of respondents think climate scientists know the best ways to address climate change. As for beliefs, 51 percent believe climate change is due to ""natural causes"" or ""no evidence"" it's man's fault.The current political cycle is dominated by shrill attacks on anyone who questions whether man-made emissions of carbon dioxide are driving global warming. But while the overwhelming share of mainstream media reporting reinforces such views, Pew's study found that only 27 percent of respondents think that ""almost all climate scientists agree that human behavior is mostly behind climate change.""In fact, only 39 percent think ""climate scientists can be trusted a lot to give full and accurate info on causes of climate change."" The current global warming industry generates billions of dollars annually for research, which helps to explain why 36 percent consider climate scientists' research findings as being influenced by a desire to ""advance their careers."" Similarly, only 32 percent believe that climate scientists rely on the ""best available scientific evidence.""Americans, however, may be tiring of the catastrophic climate change message. While President Obama continues to hammer home the man-made global warming narrative, most recently with the globe-trotting, carbon-spewing Leonardo DiCaprio, only 36 percent of Americans say they care a ""great deal"" about the issue of 'global climate change.' That's down from 41 percent who thought climate change was negatively impacting them when Pew surveyed them last year.Even Hillary Clinton has made climate change a major tent pole in her campaign, an obvious nod to Bernie Sanders' supporters who may vote for green party candidate Jill Stein. And Tim Kaine mentioned the threat of climate change before he even uttered the words ISIL during last night's vice presidential debate.It was only after Gov. Mike Pence explained the threat of radical Islamic terrorists--three words that Hillary Clinton doesn't utter--did Kaine finally acknowledge was a genuine threat. But the ""over-caffeinated"" Kaine kept returning to his climate talking points, apparently unaware that most Americans simply aren't buying the relentless climate hype.Overall, only 36 percent of Americans describe themselves as personally concerned about the issue of climate change, and more likely to believe that humans are playing some role in a warming Earth. It's only this segment of U.S. adults who are willing to say they ""put great faith in climate scientists.""Predictably, 55 percent of liberal Democrats trust there's a widespread consensus among climate scientists regarding the causes of warming. Only 16 percent of conservative Republicans say the vast majority of scientists agree on the causes of climate change. Pew's survey included views from Moderate/Liberal Republicans, Moderate/Conservative Democrats, and Independents.Delving deeper, the survey showed that 70 percent of liberal Democrats trust climate scientists to give full and accurate information about the causes of climate change, compared with just 15 percent of conservative Republicans. But 54 percent of liberal Democrats say climatologists ""very well"" understand the issues involved, as compared to 11 percent of conservative Republicans and 19 percent of moderate/liberal Republicans.The survey illustrates that Americans remain far more skeptical of man-made global warming than suggested by the nightly news. But there are rational reasons for Americans to question whether they are receiving an accurate picture of the issues involved. Not only have temperatures stagnated over the past 18 to 20 years--interrupted by a strong, naturally occurring El Nino--but computer models suggesting catastrophic global warming have continually overestimated global temperatures when compared with actual, real-world data.Pew surveyed 1,534 U.S. adults aged 18 and higher between May 10 through June 6, 2016, with a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.Thomas Richard is a freelance writer living outside of Boston, Mass.

Still, hiring at that level is enough to lower the unemployment rate over time. Economists have expected the pace to slow as the supply of unemployed workers declines.The hiring figures could keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise the short-term interest rate it controls by December. After seven years of pinning that rate at a record low near zero to try to spur more borrowing and spending, the Fed raised its rate in December. It has not acted since.But the Fed signaled after its policy meeting last month that it would likely act in the coming months. The Fed will meet in November, just before the election, but analysts expect it to hold off until the campaign ends.Recent data suggest that the economy is picking up after a weak start to the year, though growth is unlikely to accelerate very much.Consumer spending was flat in August, the weakest showing in five months. And factories have struggled as businesses have put off investing in new machinery, computers and other equipment.Still, a recent private survey found that manufacturing expanded in September after shrinking in August. Orders for factory goods jumped, suggesting that output may rise further.Consumers also appear increasingly confident about the economy, which could stimulate a rebound in spending. Consumer confidence reached a nine-year high last month.Retailers are expecting robust spending for the holiday shopping season. The National Retail Federation projects that holiday spending will rise 3.6 percent this year from last year. That's better than last year's gain and slightly above the 3.4 percent average since the Great Recession officially ended in 2009.The economy expanded at just a tepid 1.1 percent annual pace in the first six months of the year. Still, economists have forecast that growth accelerated to a 2.5 percent to 3 percent annualized pace in the July-September quarter.The slower growth hasn't led employers to cut back on staffing. Applications for unemployment benefits, a proxy for layoffs, fell on average last month to a 43-year low.SIGN UP

Both planned to use most of the day to prepare for their second debate on Sunday night, a town-hall-style forum in St. Louis.The pause was a reminder of the possibilities and perils of campaigning during a crisis. Plenty of presidents and presidential hopefuls before them have used similar natural disasters to showcase their leadership -- or their shortcomings -- in ways that can change the trajectory of the race. Both Clinton and Trump appeared to be moving carefully, for now.The campaigns spent Thursday moving staff and volunteers, closing offices and canceling events in the path of the storm, as many Floridians heeded calls to evacuate. In Florida, the Clinton campaign pulled its ads from the Weather Channel, amid criticism about insensitivity, and the Trump team pulled its negative TV ads.""Even if you want to do politics, no one is there to listen,"" said Steve Schale, a Democratic consultant who directed or advised Barack Obama's campaigns in the state in 2008 and 2012.Both the campaigns and state officials were watching closely how the storm might impact Floridian votes. The storm arrived five days before the voter registration deadline, prompting the Clinton campaign to ask state officials for an extension. Republican Gov. Rick Scott refused, saying ""everyone has had a lot of time to register.""Officials were also eyeing the vote-by-mail operation. Vote-by-mail ballots were due to be sent this week, leaving the potential for ballots to arrive just as voters evacuate their homes. At least half of Florida voters typically cast ballots early, either by mail or in person.Officials said they hope that any disruption to voting would be less severe than with Superstorm Sandy, which struck New Jersey and New York just before the 2012 presidential election and kept many voters away from polls.Sandy's greater political impact, however, may have been the way President Barack Obama used the moment to his advantage. Obama quickly surveyed the aftermath, receiving a warm welcome from Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, and promised millions in aid.Trump, who is trying to recapture momentum lost in a rocky first debate, practiced his skills in public Thursday night at a town hall in Sandown, New Hampshire. Although his aides called the event a dry run for Sunday, Trump dismissed the notion.""I said, 'Forget debate prep.' I mean, give me a break,"" said Trump, who mocked Clinton for spending days preparing. ""She's resting. She wants to build up her energy for Sunday night. And you know what? That's fine. But the narrative is so foolish.""SIGN UP"

But Florida still faced its most dangerous hurricane in living memory.Local media showed empty streets battered by wind as horizontal rain pounded the coast at dawn, with downed power lines and trees blocking streets and keeping residents trapped in place.The storm caused havoc as it hit Haiti's southern coast on Tuesday, killing more than 300 people, according to a senator from the region, Herve Fourcand.The government toll stands at 122 deaths and Radio Television Caraibes reported 264 dead. A definitive tally will take some time to collect because the damage is so intense.Aerial footage by journalists who made it to the hardest hit towns showed a ruined landscape of metal shanties with their roofs blown away and downed trees everywhere. Brown mud from overflowing rivers covered the ground.In the town of Jeremie, 80 percent of the buildings were knocked down, said the NGO Care.That town of 30,000 ""is completely destroyed,"" said Jean-Michel Vigreux, director of Care Haiti.The aerial footage is reminiscent of the aftermath of the killer earthquake that ravaged Haiti in 2010.Further south, the town of Cayes, the third largest in Haiti, was battered by the storm for hours.""I thought I was going to die. I looked death in the face,"" said 36-year-old Yolette Cazenor, standing in front of a house smashed in two by a fallen coconut palm.In Florida, the NHC said the storm was moving parallel to and just off the east coast before dawn Friday.The big question was when and if it will hit the coast and how: A direct hit would have devastating impact, but a sideswiping blow could still be catastrophic.Over the course of the day, Matthew could scour its way up a 600-mile (965-kilometer) strip of coast from Boca Raton in Florida to just north of Charleston, South Carolina, driving seawater and heavy rain inland.Only a handful of hurricanes of this strength have ever made landfall in Florida, and none since 1898 has threatened to scythe its way north along the low-lying, densely populated coast into Georgia and beyond.As the first bouts of heavy rain and powerful gusts arrived at seafront resorts presaging the storm beyond, more than 400,000 homes and businesses in Florida had lost power.Evacuation orders were issued for areas covering some three million residents and major cities like Jacksonville, Florida and Savannah, Georgia lay in the path of the terrible storm.Matthew has already battered Haiti, Jamaica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic and the Bahamas and US officials are taking no chances, warning that loss of life is a virtual certainty.""This storm is a monster,"" declared Florida's Governor Rick Scott. ""I want everybody to survive this. We can rebuild homes. We can rebuild businesses... We can't rebuild a life.""As of 1100 GMT, the storm was about 35 miles east of Cape Canaveral -- about half way up the peninsula -- which is home to the Kennedy Space Center. It was moving northwest at 14 miles per hour, the National Hurricane Center said.- Storm surge -South Florida including Miami was thus spared the worst of the storm, after it took a slight turn to the north and east.The storm will threaten Florida's beaches and ports with ferocious, howling wind and storm surges of up to 11 feet.""And when you get the wind you will get immediate flooding, strong rip current, beach erosion. The risk of tornados,"" Scott warned.""Think about this: 11 feet (3.3 meters) of possible storm surge. And on top of that, waves. So if you are close, you could have the storm surge and waves over your roof.""The National Weather Service issued a statement with a stark warning: ""There is NO local living memory of the potential of this event. If a direct landfall occurs this will be unlike any hurricane in the modern era.""Highways were jammed with people streaming inland to escape the storm, forecast to be strong enough to snap trees and blow away roofs or entire houses.As US gas stations ran dry, frantic shoppers flocked to stores for batteries, transistor radios, bread, canned goods, bottled water, ice and pet food.Earlier this week, at least four people -- three of them children -- were killed in Haiti's neighbor the Dominican Republic and more than 36,500 were evacuated, with 3,000 homes destroyed, flooded or damaged.The wealthier Bahamas, which had more time to prepare, was less badly hit and there were no reports of fatalities, but there were power outages, some roads were cut and there was property damage.SIGN UP"

Four presidential candidates registered support in the poll, with Democratic nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton at 44 percemt, Trump at 42 percent, Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson at 5 percent, and Green Party nominee Jill Stein at 1 percent.The five previous polls of a four-way matchup in New Hampshire had shown Libertarian candidate Johnson with double-digit support ranging from 10-15 percent. Trump was twice as likely to be named as the ""second"" choice for respondents supporting either Johnson or Stein.The Boston Globe/Suffolk University poll suggests that a series of embarrassing gaffes are taking a toll on Johnson in New Hampshire and that Trump is the primary beneficiary. Johnson has struggled with basic foreign policy questions in recent weeks, including when he had to ask, ""What is Aleppo?"" and couldn't name a single world-leader he admires or couldn't name the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un.The poll shows Clinton underperforming with people who say they voted for President Obama by nearly 7 percent. More than 51 percent of respondents say they voted for Obama over Romney, yet Clinton is stuck at 44 percent. President Obama carried New Hampshire and its four electoral votes in 2012, 52-46 percent.Terrorism and National Security was  just slightly ahead of Jobs and the Economy as the most important issues facing the next president.When asked whether they feel Alarmed, Excited, or Bored by the election, an overwhelming majority said they were alarmed. Both Donald Trump and Hillary Rodham Clinton struggled with whether respondents found them honest and trustworthy with solid majorities for both candidates responding that they do not find them honest and trustworthy.Clinton continues to lead Trump by 5 percent in the Real Clear Politics average of polls in New Hampshire, in which Gary Johnson remains at nearly 11 percent.Dustin Stockton is a political reporter for Breitbart News, a community liaison for Gun Owners of America, and a political strategist.

""The RNC continues to work hard for the nominee and the entire Republican Party ticket in order to get voters to the polls.""The GOP field operation was completely rebuilt, starting in 2013, with party operatives sent to key battleground states and kept there for the long-term engaging, registering and turning out voters for the Republican Party, he said. The operatives also contributed to the party's national database of voters.""The fact that the GOP has been 'permanently' in the field for years, means that we have had a tremendous head start on the Clinton campaign and are still in the lead,"" he said.In Florida, the party suspended operations Wednesday, so that its people could focus on their own safety and the safety of their loved ones as Hurricane Matthew battered the state, the spokesman said.But, before the stand down for Matthew, Republican operatives in the Sunshine State had submitted more than 335,000 more requests for absentee ballots than in the 2012 election cycle, which gives the GOP an advantage of 84,435 absentee ballot requests more than the requests handled by the Democrats, the spokesman said. In 2012, President Barack Obama won Florida by less than 75,000 votes.From 2012, Republicans have added 262,000 more voters than Democrats in Florida, he said.The representative said in Pennsylvania, GOP operatives have been catching up with Democrats.In 11 of of the 14 days before the call, Republicans have requested more absentee ballots than Democrats, he said. ""This turns the Democratic advantage to less than 1,000 in a state that has gone Blue for the last two decades.""The spokesman said in the Keystone State, Republicans have out-registered Democrats in September, adding 30,000 new voters to the rolls that month. In the last four years, Republicans have added 223,552 voters in the state.In September, Republicans out registered Democrats and New Mexico and Iowa, too, he said.In Iowa, Democrats have been underperforming their 2012 results, he said. Wednesday alone, the GOP submitted absentee ballot 5,000 more requests than the Democrats in Iowa.There are 39,000 more registered Republicans in Iowa than in 2012, he said.Democratic absentee ballot requests in Iowa are off 51 percent from 2012, he said.In Michigan, Republicans have a 59,000 request advantage for absentee ballots, he said.The pace of requests in Michigan for the last 14 days was 1,642-per-day, the spokesman said. ""This is a flip from the previous two weeks,when Democrats were leading.""In the three days before the conference call, absentee ballot requests in North Carolina from Republicans have been 1,902 more than from Democrats, where the GOP is already in the lead, he said.In the last week of September, GOP volunteers and operatives have knocked on more than one million doors., he said.Before Hillary Clinton accepted the Democratic nomination for president, RNC operatives and staff had logged more than 1.2 million hours of organizing, the spokesman said.SIGN UP"
27	http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/07/immigration-costs-dismissed-elites/	Survey: Few Elites See Threat from Legal Immigration, Refugees	"A new survey shows vast gaps between the opinion of elites and of ordinary Americans about the burdens and costs of legal immigration. SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERTwenty-seven percent of Democratic supporters, but only four percent of Democratic Party elites, said they agree that that large-scale immigration is a ""critical threat."" That's a 23-point gap, or a seven-fold difference between leaders and led in the Democratic coalition. In some ways, that gap in the Democratic Party is larger than the gap in the GOP, which has torn itself in two this year over the issue. Sixty-seven percent of GOP supporters, but only 16 percent of GOP leaders, see large number of immigrants as a critical threat. That's a larger 51-point gap, but a smaller four-fold difference of opinion between elites and ordinary GOP members, than seen in the Democratic Party.The survey of 2,061 adult Americans was published Oct. 6 by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.The new survey also inadvertently undermined the Democrats' claim that the Americans' broad opposition to cheap-labor immigration, and job displacement by immigrants, is powered by mental illness, or ""xenophobia,"" instead of by normal economic, cultural and national community priorities. ""You know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of [Donald] Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables,"" Hillary Clinton said Sept. 9. ""They're racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic .... some of those folks, they are irredeemable, but thankfully they are not America.'Thirty-three percent of Trump supporters have a positive view of Mexican immigrants in the United States -- but 75 percent of his supporters also have a positive view of ""Mexicans living in Mexico,"" according to the poll. That positive view of Mexicans-in-Mexico is shared by 80 percent of Republicans, 80 percent of all Americans, and 82 percent of Democrats, leaving Trump's supporters with similar generous attitudes as other Americans towards foreigners living in their own countries.The survey also showed greater empathy among Trump's supporters -- compared to among Democrats -- for their fellow Americans who have to pay the huge social and economic costs of mass-immigration. Each year, 4 million Americans turn 18 years old and enter the workforce. But, each year, the federal government also imports 2 million immigrants, guest-workers, refugees and asylum seekers and illegal immigrants. The inflow of professionals and workers drives down the salaries of American white-collar and blue-collar workers while boosting income for investors and employers. The inflow also crowd the schools used by the children of lower-income Americans, sharply increases tax transfers from Americans to immigrants, reduces innovation and productivity, pushes many lower-skilled Americans out of the workforce, and enables large-scale violence by immigrant communities against Americans who do not live in protected neighborhoods.But immigration also provide elites with a comforting supply of cheap and disposable domestic labor and of service workers, usually housed in districts that are distant from their homes. The survey also showed a huge increase among GOP supporters in concerns for their fellow Americans' jobs. The 2016 Chicago Council Survey reveals that 85 percent of core Trump supporters and 78 percent of Republicans say protecting American jobs is a very important foreign policy goal. In contrast, the 2014 survey of foreign policy opinion leaders found that only 37 percent of Republican opinion leaders think protecting American jobs is a very important foreign policy goal.The survey also dismissed hopes by elite progressives and by establishment GOP activists that the public's worry about cheap-labor immigration will fade after the election. Some commentators believe that Trumpism--""a personality-fueled movement that has proven, against the smart money's predictions, to be in tune with the frustrations of a significant slice of the electorate""48-- will disappear if Trump loses the election.The data in this report suggest that this will not be the case. This election cycle has brought certain underlying tensions between Republicans and Democrats to the fore. While the divisions on the issues of immigration and globalization are now more prominent, they were not created in the past year alone. Democrats and Republicans have expressed diverging opinions about immigration since 2002, and the gap between Republican and Democratic views on globalization has grown steadily since 2008.The council is a business-led group which has been a strong backer of cheap-labor migration for many years. In 2014, for example, a survey of the group's members showed that 75 percent strongly backed the 2013 immigration-expansion bill -- but only 18 percent were willing to let illegal immigrants get citizenship and thus likely vote against GOP candidates. The council's new survey does not ask Americans about the impact of immigration on their wages and salaries. Business groups profit from the annual inflow of lower-wage workers and welfare-funded immigrant buyers.In 2013, John Rowe, a senior member of the Chicago council, and a former chairman and CEO of Exelon Corp., urged new rules to ease hiring of more immigrant workers. ""Different businesses want different kinds of people. A restaurant may want waiters and cooks, a hospital wants nurses and doctors, a university wants physicists, a business like Exelon needs more engineers,"" Rowe told an interviewer on Chicago Tonight in February 2013. Rowe dismissed concerns about American workers. ""Most of these jobs [for immigrants] are in places where the existing unemployed either are unable to compete for them, or don't want to compete for them,"" he said.The Chicago council also released this month another report calling for an amnesty for the roughly 12 million illegal migrants in the United States. That report was produced with the D.C. Bipartisan Policy Center, an establishment-funded advocacy group led by former legislators.

""Many of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country,"" Trump said. ""But we now have an obligation to them, and to their children, to control future immigration - as we have following previous immigration waves - to ensure assimilation, integration and upward mobility. Within just a few years immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records.""Brownstein asked Ryan what he thought ""about limiting immigration so that we maintain a certain population balance.""""I've never looked at it like that,"" Ryan said-- later explaining that he did not support Trump's call for immigration curbs because he wants to be able to import more foreign migrants into the country who will milk Wisconsin cows.""[We need to] transition our legal system so visas are given to what are needed for the economy,"" Ryan said. ""Do we have a shortage of dairy workers in western Wisconsin? Yes, we do! Do we have a shortage of high-tech Silicon Valley software engineers? Boomers are retiring. We're going to need medical professions. We're going to need nurses and doctors... We're going to need people.""Ryan's suggestion that there is a shortage of high-skilled tech workers is a favorite talking point amongst business interests and Silicon Valley executives, who stand to profit from an influx of low-wage foreign workers. However, it is a talking point that tech labor market experts have thoroughly debunked. U.S. Census data shows there are more than 11 million Americans with degrees with Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) who lack employment in these fields. In fact, U.S. schools are graduating two times more students with STEM degrees than are annually finding employment in these fields.Ryan's mention of low-skilled labor shortages amongst Wisconsin dairy farmers is equally interesting, as Ryan has previously suggested that an influx of low-skilled immigrant labor helps Wisconsin dairy farmers keep wages low. As Ryan told the National Journal in 2013:""[Low-skilled immigrants] bring labor to our economy so jobs can get done. The dairy farmers in western Wisconsin are having a hard time finding anyone to help them produce their products, which are mostly cheese. If they can't find workers, then they can't produce, and we'll end up importing. The flip side of the argument is: Just raise wages enough to attract people. But you raise wages too much in certain industries, then you'll get rid of those industries, and we'll just have to import.""Ryan has repeatedly made the case for open borders immigration system. Under this globalist worldview, any willing employer should be able to hire any willing worker regardless of what country they live in. Under this theory, there is no limitation whatsoever to the amount of labor that can be imported into the country and, thus, there is no preference given to American citizens for jobs.During his interview with Brownstein, Ryan went on to suggest that the country would soon face labor shortages of such a dire extreme that even if the U.S. were to employ all of the 94 million Americans outside of the labor force, there still would be U.S. jobs that would go unfilled. Ryan said:""Even if we... get every able-bodied person out of welfare to work--there are 94 million able-bodied adults that aren't in the workforce, some by choice, many not. Even if we get everybody off of welfare into work... we're still going to have population needs because of the demographics in this country.""Ryan suggested that the U.S. will ""need"" foreign workers to fill skill-sets that ""cannot"" be met by Americans.""We're going to need legal immigrants. So that means, in my mind, visas ought to be given based upon your contribution to society, your skill-set that is needed in our economy that cannot, is not, being filled by Americans.""According to Pew polling data, 92 percent of the Republican electorate--and 83 percent of the American electorate overall--want to see immigration levels frozen or reduced. Based on Pew's data, Ryan represents only a minuscule seven percent of the GOP electorate that wants to expand immigration levels.""[Low-skilled immigrants] bring labor to our economy so jobs can get done. The dairy farmers in western Wisconsin are having a hard time finding anyone to help them produce their products, which are mostly cheese. If they can't find workers, then they can't produce, and we'll end up importing. The flip side of the argument is: Just raise wages enough to attract people.
