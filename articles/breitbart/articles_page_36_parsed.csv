Vogel and Danny Vinik:SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERHillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, last year signed a $7,000-a-month contract with the foundation of a major Clinton donor who made a fortune selling a type of mortgage that some critics say contributed to the housing collapse, hacked emails show.In February of last year, as Podesta was working to lay the groundwork for Clinton's soon-to-launch campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, he signed the contract with the Sandler Foundation, which was started by Herb Sandler and his late wife Marion Sandler.The contract -- a copy of which was included in emails illegally obtained from Podesta's Gmail account and disseminated Monday by WikiLeaks -- is still active, according to Herb Sandler, who said that it calls for Podesta to provide advice on grant-making and other foundation functions.It's unusual for the full-time chairman of a general-election presidential campaign to maintain an active side deal with a major donor to that campaign -- let alone to raise money from that donor for the campaign.Read the rest of the article here.SIGN UPFrom Politico's Kenneth P.

Gov. Phil Scott has been targeted by Democrats for his past support for legislation that restricts late-term abortions and requires parents to be notified when their teenage daughters are seeking an abortion.""I'm pro-choice,"" Scott said, reports the Burlington Free Press. ""I believe it. I really do. I'm just not pro-choice enough.""Though Scott would still like to see restrictions on abortions later in pregnancy and parental notifications for young girls seeking abortion, he also admits Vermont's Democrat-led legislature would likely not pass such measures.Scott - who prefers to focus on economic issues such as how to keep taxes low - says even the discussion of an issue such as abortion during the campaign is a distraction.Nevertheless, Democrats - emboldened by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's insistence on abortion on demand up until birth - fueled the issue with Scott with a Planned Parenthood political action ad condemning him for his support for abortion restrictions. Scott's campaign responded with an ad claiming Planned Parenthood's ad is based on ""distortions and lies.""""There are differences between you and Democrat Sue Minter when it comes to protecting a woman's right to choose and women's access to health care,"" stated a letter Democrats reportedly gave to Scott's campaign manager. ""It is unacceptable, however, to attack Planned Parenthood directly with negative TV ads, especially at a time when women's health care is under constant assault from national Republicans.""Sharon Toborg of Vermont Right to Life said her group is supporting Scott because he is ""certainly preferable"" to Minter.""One who supports abortion on demand throughout all nine months of pregnancy and one who at least is not going to march in lockstep with the abortion lobby in Vermont,"" Toborg reportedly said, describing the issue in the gubernatorial race.Minter's views are in line with Clinton and the abortion industry. Clinton has clearly said unborn babies have no constitutional right to life - even up until their due date after nine months of pregnancy.In the medical animation video below, former abortionist Dr. Anthony Levatino shows what happens to a baby during abortion at 25 weeks of development:   [VIDEO]As Levatino describes, at 25 weeks, an unborn baby is almost fully developed and could survive outside the womb. Therefore, the abortionist will first kill the baby in utero by injecting him or her with digoxin or potassium chloride, substances that cause cardiac arrest, and then induce the mother's labor to deliver her baby stillborn. The process occurs over several days.Clinton has also vowed to repeal the longstanding Hyde Amendment, a federal law that prohibits taxpayer funding of abortion. Clinton says by repealing the Hyde Amendment, more low-income black and Hispanic women can gain easy access to abortion.In addition, Clinton has promised to appoint pro-abortion justices to the Supreme Court.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly 13,000 fully developed babies are aborted each year in the United States. The Guttmacher Institute reports that Vermont is one of seven states that allow abortion up until birth for any reason at all.Planned Parenthood has been on defense throughout the past year after allegations that it sells the body parts of babies it aborts in its clinics for a profit.SIGN UP"	['Clinton']	['abortion']

""They have evolved, they are more coordinates and are moving them (illegal immigrants) a lot quicker."" As Breitbart Texas reported, the area known as Texas' Rio Grande Valley has been a prime human smuggling area for Mexico's Gulf Cartel with the criminal organization moving record numbers of illegal immigrants through the region. Information obtained from intelligence officials within Mexico's Federal Police revealed that all human smuggling from the areas immediately south of the border from Starr County to the Gulf of Mexico is controlled by the Gulf Cartel. The criminal organization divides the illegal immigrants by their country of origin and whether they have been previously deported. The immigrants who come from countries other than Mexico and have not been previously deported are pushed through certain well-known areas with a heavy presence of law enforcement. The move is aimed at not only tying down law enforcement resources but also taking advantage of the perceived lack of enforcement by the current administration. According to the intelligence officials from Mexico, the immigrants are coached into requesting refugee status or told that once they are arrested they will be processed and given a ""permiso"", the name misleadingly used by smugglers to refer to court documents setting their next immigration hearing. The immigrants who are from Mexico or have been previously deported are moved West to areas where cartel smugglers are able to get across the Rio Grande in a clandestine fashion. Once illegal immigrants are in Texas, human smugglers take them to stash houses where they hold them in large numbers until they are able to prepare the next leg of the trip. In San Juan, Gonzalez's officers have been targeting human stash house within the city. With the help of an awareness campaign, Gonzalez and his team have created a tip-line for citizens to report possible stash houses. In recent weeks, Gonzalez has noted a new trend where human smugglers have begun to have smaller groups in their houses in order to keep a lower profile. In an effort to not draw attention smugglers have also been improving the condition of the illegal immigrants they keep in the stash houses that San Juan officers have come across.

""It's not about emails,"" Lakoff writes. ""It's about public communication by a woman.""SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFrom Lakoff's TIME magazine op-ed:I am mad. I am mad because I am scared. And if you are a woman, you should be, too. Emailgate is a bitch hunt, but the target is not Hillary Clinton. It's us.The only reason the whole email flap has legs is because the candidate is female. Can you imagine this happening to a man? Clinton is guilty of SWF (Speaking While Female), and emailgate is just a reminder to us all that she has no business doing what she's doing and must be punished, for the sake of all decent women everywhere. There is so much of that going around.The people are demanding Clinton act like moral exemplars, thundering from the pulpit like Jonathan Edwards or Cotton Mather. But Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani, Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich, Rush Limbaugh and their many conservative friends are not remotely Clinton's moral superiors. They are simply bullies, using gender discrimination to give a veneer of plausibility to their accusations.FBI Chief James Comey has shown himself to be another bully of the same kind. He has repeatedly talked down to Clinton, admonishing her as a bad parent would a 5-year-old. He has accused her of ""poor judgment"" and called her use of a private email server ""extremely careless."" If Comey's a Boy Scout, here's one old lady who will never let him help her across the street.If the candidate were male, there would be no scolding and no ""scandal."" Those very ideas would be absurd. Men have a nearly absolute right to freedom of speech. In theory, so do women, but that, as the creationists like to say, is only a theory.Read the rest here.

Trump by four percentage points--just outside the 3.4 percent margin of error--in Virginia. This is the state's first survey taken since FBI director James Comey announced he was reopening the criminal investigation into Clinton's illicit home-brew email server that she set up in violation of State Department guidelines.The poll of 800 likely voters found Clinton at 49 percent compared to Trump's 45 percent. Libertarian Gary Johnson pulled three percent and the Green Party's Jill Stein pulled one percent. The survey was conducted from Friday Oct. 28 through Sunday Oct. 30.The fact that things are this close in Virginia is shocking to many political observers in the home stretch here, as it was widely presumed that Clinton had wrapped up the state a long time ago with the selection of Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine as her running mate. But now it seems that the Democrats' grip on Virginia is slipping, and its 13 electoral votes hang in the balance. Without those electoral votes, Hillary Clinton's pathway to the White House becomes essentially non-existent.Clinton starts the race with a default of about 185 electoral votes, giving her California, Oregon, Washington state, New York state, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Washington, D.C., Hawaii, Illinois, Vermont and Maine's first congressional district.With Trump putting traditionally blue states like Michigan, New Mexico, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania--along with Maine's second congressional district--in play, that makes Virginia must-win for Clinton. She can't afford to lose it, but Trump can--as without Virginia, Trump has a number of different pathways to the White House while Clinton does not have a path without it.In the final week plus of the race, the map has significantly expanded for Trump as the billionaire businessman has become competitive in many of these places. It's unclear which, if any, he may break out in for a win, but the fact he's surging everywhere across the board has got to have the Clinton campaign worried. But Trump has been campaigning in New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Michigan over the past couple days.SIGN UP	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Kaine']	[]

""But thanks to help from the state, the county is meeting the challenge of identifying and burying the bodies, for now.""Following intense media coverage during the 2014 flood of illegal immigrants that reported Brooks County was exhausting its financial resources investigating and burying the bodies of the illegal immigrants who died in the county, the State of Texas dedicated additional financial and manpower resources to assist the county. Breitbart Texas has reported extensively on the massive humanitarian problem faced by Brooks County.Over the past several years, the sheriff's office of this small community located about 80 miles north of the Texas border with Mexico has been overwhelmed by the flood of illegal immigrants. Many of these immigrants have died while attempting to sneak around a U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint located in the middle of the county.The numbers of bodies found has increased this year despite a massive effort by U.S. Border Patrol agents and the State of Texas who have supplemented the county's efforts to stop the deaths with additional manpower and resources for the state's poorest county.Both the U.S. Border Patrol and Texas Department of Public Safety have increased their presence in the county since 2014, Martinez explained.

"New emails, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by the Republican National Committee and then shared with ABC News made public on October 11, highlight the cozy connections between the Clinton Foundation, Hillary Clinton's State Department, and the Clinton's cronies.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERI'm aware of this new information due to my multi-year collaboration with Christine Lakatos and her Green Corruption Files. She alerted me to the ""bombshell new evidence"" and she now has a full 26-page report available.The billions of dollars that poured into Haiti after the 2010 earthquake did little to help the 1.5 million people who were displaced when the 7.0 magnitude earthquake destroyed their homes in 2010. Earlier this year, HBO's VICE news magazine series did a segment titled, ""The Haitian Moneypit."" In it, Vikram Gandhi takes viewers through the deplorable conditions found in the refugee camps that have no electricity, fresh water, or functioning toilets. He claims that ""hundreds of thousands of survivors are still displaced.""Lakatos explains, ""In digging through over 1000 emails from Hillary's State Department related to Haiti, I discovered additional damning proof that the Haiti 'reconstruction plan' was a huge pay-to-play scheme for filling the coffers of the Clintons and their cronies."" She continues: ""We now have an ocean of evidence confirming that our former president Bill Clinton and his wife, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, exploited the poor Haitian people in the wake of the 2010 earthquake.""In 2015, in an article titled The King and Queen of Haiti, Politico summarizes: ""The amounts of money over which the Clintons and their foundation had direct control paled beside the $16.3 billion that donors pledged in all.""While Lakatos' complete report provides details with links to the supporting documentation, due to space here, I am jumping to, what I believe is, the most dramatic example: The Caracol Industrial Park (CIP)--a $300 million project that was planned before the 2010 earthquake and was built in a part of Haiti that was not impacted by the earthquake (therefore not helping the victims).The comingling of players, companies and organizations is overwhelming--but one of Hillary Clinton's closest confidants, Cheryl Mills, is at the center of it. Addressing the project and the Clinton's ""public-private web,"" the New York Times (NYT) states: ""Cheryl D. Mills worked ceaselessly to help a South Korean garment maker open a factory in Haiti, the centerpiece of United States government's efforts to jump-start the island nation's economy after the 2010 earthquake.""In short, ""Sea-A Trading secured millions of dollars in incentives to make its Haiti investment more attractive,"" writes NYT. Sea-A Trading's chairman Woong-ki Kim became a Clinton Foundation donor after his firm secured the lucrative contract in Haiti. Adding to the intrigue, when Mills left the state department, she started a company called BlackIvy Group--for which Kim is a financial backer. NYT describes the relationship this way: ""The partnership with Mr. Kim sheds light on the business activities of Ms. Mills--a longtime Clinton loyalist who is likely to play a significant role in any future Clinton White House--as well as the interlocking public and private relationships that have long characterized the Clintons' inner circle.""The company makes clothes using Haiti's cheap labor (roughly $6.85 a day--though reports claim the factory doesn't pay that much and has other labor issues). Workers complain that after they pay for lunch and transportation, they don't have enough money left to feed their families. Many feel that they were better off farming the land they were thrown off of to make room for CIP.The primarily female workforce makes clothes for large American retailers, including Wal-Mart and Gap Inc., which get special tax breaks for importing the clothes made in Haiti.  Both companies are Clinton Foundation donors: Wal-Mart has given the foundation $1 to $5 million and Gap has given between $250,000 and $500,000.Part of the $124 million in ""incentives"" the U.S. government provided (an unwitting donation from taxpayers) for CIP was to build a power plant to run the factory. While I have been unable to ascertain what fuels the plant, video makes it clear it is not wind or solar that Clinton touts. My research revealed: ""Haiti is highly dependent on imported fossil fuels for electric generation."" It is most likely oil-fueled.The electricity provided by the Caracol Electrification Project also powers some of the surrounding communities. The USAID site features stories of people living with electricity for the first time and elaborates on the dramatic improvement in health and quality of life since the area has reliable power. Many other similar reports exist.A few months ago, Lakatos and I wrote about Hillary's clean cookstove initiative: The developing world wants natural gas and electricity, Hillary Clinton sends cookstoves. This story is similar.Considering the conditions in the Sea-A Trading factory and the hundreds of thousands of people throughout Haiti still living in plastic tents and without electricity and the benefits it provides--one must wonder if the hundreds of millions of dollars that went to enriching Clinton Foundation donors, like Kim, wouldn't have been better spent providing reliable fossil-fuel power to the people of Haiti. Doing so would have boosted the economy and helped families improve their lives. But that's not how the Clintons operate and their fingerprints are all over the Haiti recovery efforts. Obviously, they have hurt the Haitian people, while helping themselves and their friends.The author of Energy Freedom, Marita Noon serves as the executive director for Energy Makes America Great Inc., and the companion educational organization, the Citizens' Alliance for Responsible Energy (CARE).

A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America and will stop the jobs from leaving Michigan.During his rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Trump noted that in addition to those jobs:GM laid off 314 workers at the Lake Orion Assembly Plant in 2013 because of imports from the South Korean trade deal pushed through by Hillary Clinton.

Those jobs went to Mexico, China, India, and other countries.Trump explained that the devastation has been a result of Hillary Clinton-supported policies.Michigan has lost more than one in four  manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA ... a deal strongly supported by crooked Clinton. Before NAFTA went into effect, there were 280,000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is down to less than 160,000 workers and it's going down fast. Under NAFTA, we eliminated our tariffs on Mexico, but Mexico raised their VAT on us. ... So when we send products to Mexico, we pay a 17 percent tax. ... Our trade deficit with China grew almost 40 percent during Hillary's tenure as secretary of state. Her trade deal with South Korea-- her baby-- killed another 100,000 American jobs.Trump argued the Hillary Clinton-backed NAFTA was ""defective"" because it has benefitted Mexico at the expense of American workers--describing it as a ""one-way highway right into their pockets"":It's a one-way highway. They get the jobs. They get the money. They get the factories. We get the drugs. We get the unemployment. We get the losses. ... That's not too good. America is running an early $800 billion annual trade deficit. ... We're living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.Trump pledged that a Trump administration would pursue an ""America first"" trade policy and would stop the bleeding of American jobs to other countries: ""At the core of my contract [with the American voter] is my plan to bring back your jobs,"" Trump said, adding:From now on, it's going to be America first. If Ford or another company announces they want to move their jobs to Mexico or another country, then I will pick up the phone-- even though it's not very presidential for me to be calling the head of a company, but it's so easy. I will call the executives ... [and] tell them that if they want to do that ... we will charge a 35 percent tax when they try to ship their products back across what will be a very strong border.""It used to be the cars made in Flint, and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Now the cars are made in Mexico, and you can't drink the water in Flint. But we're going to turn it all around,"" Trump said. He continued:Look at the City of Detroit. It used to be the manufacturing hub of the world. Now, nearly half of Detroit residents do not work. It has the second-highest violent crime rate in the country, and the children are trapped in failing government schools. Yet, as the people of Detroit suffer, Hillary wants to spend trillions of dollars on government benefits for illegal immigrants and refugees. We are going to rebuild Detroit, and we are going to rebuild Michigan. We're going to bring your jobs back.Trump suggested that it is time for the nation to ""close the chapter on the Clintons"" and begin focusing on the needs and interests of the American people.""Hillary Clinton put the office of secretary of state up for sale, and if she ever got the chance, she'd put the oval office up for sale, too,"" Trump warned. He added:When we close the chapter on the Clintons, we open a bright new chapter focused on the American People.

It has not executed anyone since 1984.But President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had suggested Turkey could bring back the death penalty in the wake of the failed July coup.And hundreds of people have chanted ""we want the death penalty!"" at government rallies.But Brussels has warned any return could mean the end of Ankara's talks to join the 28-member bloc.Erdogan said at the weekend his government would ask parliament to consider reintroducing the death penalty to punish the plotters behind the coup bid.His comments drew the ire of European politicians including Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz who said it was ""a cruel and inhumane form of punishment"".The Council of Europe has also condemned any move to reinstate the death penalty, saying it was ""incompatible with membership of the Council"".Despite Erdogan's comments. Yildirim told lawmakers from his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP): ""I want it to be known that that this (death penalty) would not be applied retroactively.""Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) leader Devlet Bahceli told his lawmakers that he was ready to support the AKP on the issue.""Since there is a need for the death penalty and since our nation wants this... there is no need to discuss this unnecessarily.

The horrific death of the fish seller has caused tears in the Rif and outrage among Moroccans,"" the daily Akhbar Alyoum said.Large-scale protests are rare in Morocco, where the king still holds ultimate sway. Five years ago the authorities calmed Arab Spring-style protests in 2011 with reforms, spending and tougher security while leaders in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya were swept from power.But in recent days, a frenzy of angry postings on social media and protest chants have blamed the Makhzen, a term used to describe the royal establishment.""Protests will continue until all the responsible for that crime are punished,"" said Al-Houssine Lmrabet, one of the protests organizers. ""We also want guarantees that this will not happen again. This should start by cleaning the public administration of corrupted people.""Morocco's protests erupted at a sensitive moment as the kingdom prepares to host the 2016 United Nations climate change conference in November and the prime minister begins to form a coalition government after elections this month.Not another TunisiaThe parallel between Fikri's death and that of Mohamed Bouazizi in Tunisia in late 2010 has prompted speculation about the possible fallout from the latest protests in Morocco.Bouazizi set himself on fire in desperation because police confiscated fruit and vegetables he was selling, starting the process that toppled decades-old regimes across the region.Similarly, Fikri had fish confiscated by police on Friday after he bought it at the port. Local authorities have banned swordfish fishing and sales in this season.According to local media and authorities, Fikri jumped inside the trash truck that police used to destroy the confiscated fish in a desperate attempt to recover it and he was caught inside the crusher.Activists accused police officers of ordering garbage men to crush Fikri, but the Moroccan police (DGSN) denied those accusations in a statement on Sunday.On Sunday, the Moroccan Association of Human Rights (AMDH) warned of a ""possible repeat"" of the 2011 protests in Morocco.But while the scale of the protests has surprised many observers, analysts stress that Morocco is a very different country from pre-2011 Tunisia, with democratic elections and a monarch who still enjoys broad support.In an effort to calm tensions, King Mohamed, currently on a tour of Africa, has ordered the interior minister to visit the victim's family and present royal condolences. The government also promised an investigation.Moroccan authorities heavily police protests, nervous over popular unrest since the 2011 protests.

""These leaders insist on their constitutional right to their religious beliefs and on the freedom to act on them in the public square.""The authors of the Open Letter challenged the attempts of ""demagogues"" to accuse people of faith of ""promoting Jim Crow laws"" when they seek to safeguard their freedom to obey their conscience and follow the teachings of their sacred texts.""There is no analogy between the apartheid of Jim Crow and the religious freedom laws in force across this country,"" the letter declares. Moreover, it is ""absurd to demean the defense of this faith as the equivalent of the injustices that we have fought and overcome.""Regarding the recent Wikileaks revelations of messages from within Team Clinton, the authors decry the ""open contempt for religious freedom within your own campaign"" expressed when ""key players on your staff have sought to subvert Catholic teaching on sexuality by planting externally funded groups in the church to advance a politically correct agenda.""""What would you do as president to guarantee that religious freedoms are balanced against civil rights rather than being trumped by them?"" the authors queried.""Will black pastors and intellectuals be free to lead and guide our communities in accordance with our widely accepted faith-based knowledge tradition?"" they asked.Follow Thomas D.

That's roughly one new immigrant, legal and illegal, for every two Americans who began looking for a job in 2015.In addition, almost 9 percent of all babies born in the United States during 2013 -- or roughly 300,000 babies -- were birthed by illegal immigrants. If those births are discounted, the likely 2015 inflow of migrants was very close to one immigrant for every two births to American parents.In 2014, the inflow of 1.6 million migrants added up to two new immigrants for every five births or every five new graduates.That huge inflow of migrants in 2014 and 2015 effectively increased the annual supply of new workers by almost 50 percent. That's great for employers, good news for retailers, and also for Wall Street's investors, but is bad news for Americans' wages, bad news for lower-skilled Americans living in states with high real unemployment and bad news for productivity.The rapid pace of 2014 immigration was the highest level since almost 1.7 million immigrants arrived in 2000, although most of those who arrived in 2000 were illegally searching for jobs in the dot.com boom.That 2000 record is likely to have been broken during the second half of 2015, partly because of Obama's decision to allow Central American migrants to cross the border and ask judges for asylum, work-permits and Green Cards. From October 2012 to October 2016, Obama has used his power over agencies to allow 300,000 Central American migrants to seek asylum, at a cost of perhaps $200 billion over the next 75 years. Roughly 117,000 of those Central American migrants were admitted in 2016.In 2014, roughly 1.1 million of the 1.5 million migrants were legally admitted, while roughly 400,000 were illegals, according to the CIS. Many of the illegals sneaked across the border, but others flew into the country and overstayed their visas.During his tenure, Obama has sharply reduced border enforcement, reduced repatriations and has done little to deport foreign criminals.In 2013, Obama also worked with business groups and the established media for passage of an immigration bill that would have provided citizenship for 33 million migrants over 10 years, increased the inflow of refugees and allowed an unlimited number of foreign graduate students to get Green Cards each year. The so-called ""Comprehensive Immigration Reform"" bill was blocked by public opposition.However, Hillary Clinton has promised to implement many of those measures if she's elected -- including the award of Green Cards to foreign professionals who enroll in U.S. graduate schools alongside young debt-burdened American graduates.Since 1965, the massive inflow of foreign migrants has pushed the total number of foreign-born people in the United States up to 43 million in 2015, alongside roughly 270 million Americans. That's roughly one foreign-born person for every seven Americans. If the 11 million illegals are discounted, then 270 million Americans are living alongside 33 million legal immigrants. That's almost one legal immigrant for every nine Americans, including the American-born children of the immigrants.But the inflow has rapidly increased the numbers of immigrants and native-born Americans who speak a foreign language is their homes. ""Newly released Census Bureau data shows that a record 64.7 million U.S. residents five years of age and older spoke a language other than English at home in 2015 ... up 5.2 million since 2010 and increased by 1.5 million in just the last year,"" according to the Center for Immigration Studies.In the economy, the annual inflow of immigrants is supplemented by a huge annual inflow of roughly 800,000 temporary, and lower-paid, guest workers. The blue-collar temporary workers, such as H-2B workers, are usually replaced each year by new blue-collar workers, but the number of resident long-term white-collar workers has risen to roughly 1 million during Obama's two terms.The inflow of migrants is increasingly Asian, not Hispanic. Since 2010, according to CIS:Major sending countries with the largest numerical increases in immigrants living in the United States since 2010 were India (up 609,000), China (up 510,000), the Philippines (up 205,000), the Dominican Republic (up 184,000), El Salvador (up 138,000), Cuba (up 106,000), Nigeria (up 104,000), Guatemala (up 97,000), Haiti (up 88,000), Pakistan (up 80,000), Honduras (up 76,000), Bangladesh (up 75,000), Venezuela (up 71,000), Colombia (up 63,000), Vietnam (up 60,000), and Iraq (up 55,000).The states that have received the most migrants since 2010, according to CIS, are:States with the largest numerical increases in the number of immigrants from 2010 to 2015 were California (up 538,000), Texas (up 529,000), Florida (up 428,000), New York (up 232,000), New Jersey (up 133,000), Massachusetts (up 112,000), Maryland (up 108,000), Virginia (up 108,000), Pennsylvania (up 98,000), Washington (up 94,000), Georgia (up 81,000), Minnesota (up 79,000), and North Carolina (up 76,000).Obama is a progressive, and so he believes that the U.S. government should offer U.S. civil rights -- and citizenship -- to foreign-born people, regardless of what Americans prefer. In November 2014, he argued that:Sometimes we get attached to our particular tribe, our particular race, our particular religion, and then we start treating other folks differently. And that, sometimes, has been a bottleneck to how we think about immigration.  If you look at the history of immigration in this country, each successive wave, there have been periods where the folks who were already here suddenly say, 'Well, I don't want those folks' -- even though the only people who have the right to say that are some Native Americans.Read the full report here.

Dr. Jacqueline C. Rivers delivered the letter Monday to Clinton's campaign in Brooklyn, New York.Addressing Clinton, the leaders denounce the persistent narrative of her campaign, and those of other ""demagogues,"" that religious freedom laws in the United States are analogous to ""the apartheid of Jim Crow"" laws.The letter reads:Religious freedom is a precious right that we, as the leaders of the Black Church, must defend vigorously... Yet in this very nation demagogues have dared to accuse people of faith of promoting Jim Crow laws when they seek to safeguard their freedom to obey their conscience and follow the teachings of their sacred texts. There is no analogy between the apartheid of Jim Crow and the religious freedom laws in force across this country. It is the very same faith that is protected by religious freedom laws that inspired our black ancestors to lead the movement for the abolition of slavery and the end of Jim Crow apartheid in the American South. It is absurd to demean the defense of this faith as the equivalent of the injustices that we have fought and overcome.The letter's signers write, ""The drive to normalize immoral sexual behavior has inspired some to dishonor the memory of courageous blacks who experienced the unique horrors of white supremacy, slavery, rape, terrorism and apartheid in the U.S.""The leaders continue that the condemnation of religious freedom laws as ""historically and existentially equivalent to Jim Crow laws rests on false assertions.""Quoting Clinton's remarks in April of 2015 in which she said, ""Far too many women are still denied access to reproductive health care and safe childbirth... deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed,"" the black leaders assert, ""For political leaders to call for changes in citizens' beliefs is reminiscent of totalitarianism.""The leaders also note the disproportionately high percentage of black babies aborted in the United States, nearly 40 percent of all abortions performed.""Abortion in the black community has had a catastrophic impact,"" they write to Clinton. ""Black babies are dying at terrifying rates. How do you justify your unconscionable silence in the face of such destruction of innocent black life? Don't black lives matter?""The black leaders say Clinton's condescension toward religion and faith beliefs undermines what, historically, has kept the black American community together.Even as they express their outrage of young black men killed by police officers, the leaders observe nevertheless that, ""according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation over half of all murder victims in 2015 were black and, in the cases where the race of the perpetrator was known, nearly 90% of them were killed by other blacks.""The leaders assert that eroding the religious freedom rights of the black church upends ""the primary institution of our neighborhoods"" and prevents the church from having the greatest impact on young black men.""The work of the black church in our poor communities is of the utmost importance and the importance of our freedom to operate in accordance with our faith cannot be overstated,"" they write.The open letter to Clinton calls for a meeting to discuss how her administration would respond to the leaders' issues, and, especially, how she would ensure the protection of the constitutional freedoms of all Americans.The letter's signers include: Presiding Bishop Charles E. Blake, Church of God in Christ, Los Angeles, CA; Dr. Jacqueline C. Rivers, Seymour Institute for Black Church & Policy Studies, Boston, MA; Bishop Lemuel F.

The Bureau was alerted to a series of electronic connections between a server owned by the Trump organization and two servers registered to Alfa Bank. The links were at first thought ""questionable,"" but after its long investigation the FBI determined, ""there could be an innocuous explanation, like a marketing email or spam, for the computer contacts,"" the Times reported.The Trump campaign reiterated that the investigation had proven what they already knew.Trump campaign press secretary Hope Hicks noted, ""First of all, it's not a secret server. The email server, set up for marketing purposes and operated by a third-party, has not been used since 2010."" Hicks added that the traffic on that server is not used for the sort of email communications that could be employed for any sort of collusion.Alfa Bank also released a statement denying any ties to Trump.""Neither Alfa Bank nor its principals, including Mikhail Fridman and Petr Aven, have or have had any contact with Mr. Trump or his organizations,"" the statement read. ""Fridman and Aven have never met Mr. Trump nor have they or Alfa Bank had any business dealings with him. Neither Alfa nor its officers have sent Mr. Trump or his organizations any emails, information or money. Alfa Bank does not have and has never had any special or exclusive internet connection with Mr. Trump or his entities.""Now it appears that the FBI has confirmed these statements.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.SIGN UP"	['Trump', 'Warner']	[]
