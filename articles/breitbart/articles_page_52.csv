Hariri stressed that his endorsement was a ""political settlement"" for the benefit of the whole country.Nasrallah said: ""The past few days saw an important development: a declaration by the Future Movement leader (Hariri) of his support for the nomination of General Michel Aoun for the presidency. The door is now realistically wide open for a successful presidential election.""Parliament will convene on Oct. 31 for a session to elect the president, the 46th such sitting since the term of the last president, Michel Suleiman, expired in 2014. Each of the previous sittings failed to gain the two-thirds quorum needed to hold a vote.""At the next session to elect the president, all of (Hezbollah's parliamentary bloc) the Loyalty to the Resistance bloc will attend, God willing, and it will elect General Michel Aoun ... as president of the Lebanese republic,"" Nasrallah saidThe position of president must be filled by a Maronite Christian.The first round of voting requires two-thirds of Lebanon's 128 MPs to attend a session and a candidate will be elected president if they secure a two-thirds majority, or 86 votes.If no candidate gets this number of votes, a second round of voting is held on the same day where a candidate requires a simple majority of 65 votes to win.Aoun's most prominent opponent is Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri who also heads the Shiite Muslim Amal party which is an ally of Hezbollah.Berri was quoted by the state news agency on Sunday as saying he would not ""disrupt the quorum"", implying his MPs would not boycott the parliamentary session.Nasrallah spoke at a commemoration event for a Hezbollah military commander recently killed fighting in the Syrian city of Aleppo.

How will these families live?"" he asked, standing next to his small store's closed metal door.Saturday's vote also angered several politicians who claim that the law violates an article in the constitution that guarantees the freedom of religious minorities.The vote's supporters say that the very same constitution prevents any law contradicting Islam, however.With Iraq involved in an offensive to retake the city of Mosul from the Islamic State jihadist group, its biggest military operation in years, one politician argued that the law sent the wrong message.""This is a victory for the ideology of Daesh (IS),"" said Haidar al-Mullah, a politician from the Al-Arabiya alliance.""At a time when all the efforts of the Iraqi people are focused on fighting Daesh terrorists, a team of Islamist politicians in parliament gifted Daesh a victory,"" he said.""They are suppressing other beliefs, violating the freedom to practise other traditions and turning their backs on the constitution,"" Mullah told AFP.- Black market -Alcohol is rarely offered in restaurants and hotels in Iraq, but consumption is relatively widespread, especially in Baghdad.Iraq also has companies that produce various types of alcohol, such as Farida beer or Asriya arak (a regional anise-flavoured spirit).Yonadam Kanna, a leading Christian politician, was furious after the vote on Saturday and went on television to condemn it and also to vow to challenge it in a federal court.Many Iraqis also took to social media to ridicule their lawmakers.On his Facebook page, Hussein al-Ameri replied to Mahmud al-Hassan, one of the MPs who took credit for the passing of the law, and ""congratulated"" him.""Yes, that was one of the most important laws to focus on after eradicating unemployment, terrorism, corruption and terrorism,"" he wrote.In a jab at parliament, which has a reputation for being one of the hubs of corruption in the country, another Facebook user, Hammoudi Mohammed asked: ""Drinking is un-Islamic but stealing is OK?""In Baghdad's Bataween neighbourhood, one of the capital's oldest districts now best known for prostitution and crime, Saad Amir shook his head as he rested against the cart from which he sells food on the street.""Drinking is better than turning to drugs... There seems to be a decision to wreck this country. Parliament should review this decision,"" he said.Kanna also predicted that a ban on alcohol, if enforced, would lead to a rise in drug abuse, which is already a growing problem in areas such as Basra, where alcohol is harder to find than in Baghdad.Maysoun al-Damaluji, another member of parliament, was appalled.""What bankruptcy!

She made the amazing claim that she ""only meant"" she wanted open borders for energy policies. Whatever her claims, Hillary Clinton is on the same open borders page as the United Nations.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERDuring the October 19 debate, GOP nominee Donald Trump noted that, in speeches she gave to high-dollar corporations, Hillary Clinton insisted she was for open borders.In a private, richly-paid speech that Hillary delivered to a Brazilian bank on May 16, 2013, she said: ""My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, sometime in the future, with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.""The section of Hillary's address to the foreign bankers was confirmed by a release from the hacker site WikiLeaks.For her part, Hillary claimed that she doesn't want completely open borders and pointed to the segment of her speech where she mentioned energy and claimed she was only talking about sharing an electric grid across international boundaries.""If you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy,"" she said during the last debate. ""We trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined.""But this seeming obfuscation doesn't reflect many of her past claims nor even the policy proposals on her own website.Calling her plan the ""Breaking Every Barrier Agenda,"" Hillary says on her website that she wants to ""break down all the barriers"" to make things fair in the United States. Part of that plan is to ""keep immigrant families together"" by offering a sort of amnesty to allow illegal aliens to stay in the U.S. by offering a ""path to citizenship.""After reviewing her plan, the Center for Immigration Studies's Steve Camarota projected that, based on the minimal figures Clinton has put forth thus far, Clinton could add 10 million new immigrants to the U.S. during her first term alone -- in addition to the 11 million illegal immigrants to whom Clinton said she plans to grant amnesty within her first 100 days in office.In much of this, Hillary Clinton finds common cause with the United Nations, which recently announced its ""New Urban Agenda,"" a plan that includes unlimited migration across national borders.Clinton would agree with the U.N.'s plan for unlimited immigration. After all, in another WikiLeaks release, Clinton insisted that putting limits on immigration was ""fundamentally un-American."" Clinton made this claim in a speech to Goldman Sachs in October of 2013. In her address, she attacked those who want to put limits on immigration.""She's totally in line with the U.N. agenda, on board with everything they do,"" economist Patrick Wood recently told WND.com.""She's making a pre-announcement here that she's going to follow the U.N. agenda,"" Wood said.

""I just turned around and I flexed my arms and I showed them the Trump name on the back of my jersey. It made them more mad and I had more things thrown at me, more eggs, a tomato hit me in the head, somebody threw a water bottle at me -- a couple of them. It happened so fast, and it must have been an adrenaline rush because I did not know I was smiling until I saw videos of me afterwards.""She continued, ""I knew that if I was to touch one of them or I was to grab one of the flags they were waving in my face that they would have attacked me or beaten me with those flag poles that were metal. I just kept a straight face, I don't know how. I just knew if I touched one of them I would get hurt. Luckily someone let me in that hotel, finally, someone finally opened the door.""Casey also told Breitbart News that her reaction to the Project Veritas video is that it confirmed what she suspected all along.""I actually was not surprised because, when I saw those people, it was a mob,"" Casey said. ""They just looked like someone paid them to be there. They were not like normal protestors. It was a group, and they were kind of young. I had thought from the beginning because of Craiglist ads I had seen myself, Craiglist ads saying, hey we will pay you this or that to go protest this rally. I was not surprised at all and it just shows the proof now. That was something we were trying to figure out with the whole class-action lawsuit in San Jose. You know, who was behind all that stuff because someone was. I believe they were paid to come attack Trump supporters.""Moving forward, Casey said she is considering some kind of a lawsuit but not sure yet if she will move in that direction.""I'm not a lawyer but I'm watching very closely to see what happens. People that have violence and terror at the rallies must face consequences,"" she said. ""There are more videos coming out from Project Veritas that I would like to see. I also saw that Mr. Trump said in a statement that he was going to sue the DNC and HRC for the violence at his rallies. I'm going to wait and see what happens with that, but I don't want to end up on any hit list.""Casey is calling on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton to fire her campaign manager Robby Mook if proof emerges he lied to Breitbart News when he denied conversations between Clinton and a top progressive organizer involved in creating such violence at Trump rallies.""If there is proof [he lied], then yes, he should be fired,"" Casey told Breitbart News when asked on Sunday night about Mook's claim to Breitbart News in the spin room at the final presidential debate that Clinton herself did not have conversations with Democracy Partners founder Robert Creamer.""I don't believe so,"" Mook told Breitbart News when asked directly whether Hillary Clinton herself had had conversations with Creamer about the contents of the James O'Keefe Project Veritas investigative video showing that Creamer was at the center of a progressive plan to create violence at Trump rallies.Here's a full transcript of Mook's interactions with Breitbart News on this matter:BREITBART NEWS: In the debate, the video about Democracy Partners came up. I wanted to see -- did Secretary Clinton ever have any conversations with Robert Creamer about the contents of that video?ROBBY MOOK: They've never worked for our campaign so you're going to have ask them about that.BREITBART NEWS: Has she ever had any conversations with Robert Creamer about the contents?ROBBY MOOK: I don't believe so. And they've never worked for our campaign.Emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, published by WikiLeaks, show that Mook actually approved the tactic of ""bird-dogging"" at Trump rallies at least once as well.When asked about those emails, Casey asked the public why Clinton hasn't held Mook -- or any of the other players directly involved in this matter -- accountable.""I think everyone involved in this should be facing some kind of consequence,"" Casey told Breitbart News. ""If citizens start violence, they face the consequences, like, how can these people get away with it? These people should face the consequences just like anyone else who creates violence.""Casey is also calling on Creamer and Americans United for Change's Scott Foval -- who was also fired over this -- to speak up now that they're fired and tell the truth once and for all.""Now the truth comes out because those people were fired,"" Casey said. ""Those people should be forced to speak so that we can see what they have to say.""Now that Mook himself is firmly at the center of this scandal, Casey -- one of the victims of the violence sowed by the progressive community -- is stepping forward to grant one of her first exclusive interviews since the incident which occurred over the summer. That incident in San Jose was so bad, in fact, that Clinton herself appeared on CNN to condemn the violence against Trump supporters from her progressive backers in an interview with Jake Tapper.""I condemn all violence in our political arena,"" Clinton told Tapper back then. ""I condemned it when Donald Trump was inciting it and congratulating people who were engaging in it. I condemn it by those who are taking violent protests to physical assault against Donald Trump.""But Casey, the victim who literally had eggs cracked and strewn through her hair in images that made Americans revolt at the time, told Breitbart News she doesn't believe Clinton really condemns it. In fact, when asked about Clinton's condemnation of this violence back in the summer, Casey told Breitbart News that she doesn't trust her.""I believe that she is doing whatever she can to ruin Trump,"" Casey said. ""She will do whatever she can to make him look bad. Trump is not promoting any kind of violence at all. If anything, he has brought people together. I have more friends now than I've ever had of all different ages and races. Trump is bringing people together and she is dividing people. It's right there in front of everyone's eyes, I don't know how people don't see it.""Of the progressive activists pushing the violence out there as evidenced by the Project Veritas videos, Casey added of Clinton: ""She's hiding it, but she's behind it, and she's definitely paying people to go do this.""It's still as of yet unclear if Clinton herself had conversations directly with Creamer on this matter, but if she did, then Casey says she think it will prove that Hillary Clinton is ""corrupt"" once and for all.""I think Hillary is corrupt,"" Casey said. ""She's a liar. She's a murderer and she's doing whatever she can legally and illegally to stop Mr. Trump from becoming president. He loves America; he always has American flags behind him. I've been to a Hillary office and there wasn't one American flag in that office, and I can prove it with my own videos. He's the only one who will keep our constitution, he's the only one who is going to save our country and protect us.""BREITBART NEWS: In the debate, the video about Democracy Partners came up. I wanted to see -- did Secretary Clinton ever have any conversations with Robert Creamer about the contents of that video?

Trump's unorthodox campaign in Florida is still neck-and-neck with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the latest polls, despite being outmatched in spending in this critical battleground state. The race remains close in large part thanks to the ""movement"" he often references from the stage at his rallies nationwide.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROver the past several weeks, Breitbart News has spent time with a variety of Trump backers in Florida--ranging from his campaign's state co-chairman and Florida GOP vice chairman Joe Gruters to grassroots activists and die hard supporters--to figure out what exactly is driving Trump's appeal in a state with 29 electoral votes critical to either candidate's White House chances.Carlos Arias, a second-generation Cuban-American and die hard Donald Trump supporter, is a Miami native who works as a biomedical professor by day. But, by night, he is on his own dime and with his own time building support for the Trump campaign in the Cuban community here--using traditional grassroots organizing tactics, and newer ones through social media. As part of his effort, Arias manages the Cubans for Trump Facebook page. But he also walks the streets of Little Havana working his friends, family, and neighbors over to Team Trump.""What's there not to support about the guy?"" Arias told Breitbart News in a sit-down interview before taking reporters on the streets with him. ""I mean, he's an amazing leader. He's a very intelligent guy. He has an expertise for making deals, for making trade deals, for the economy, for money, for running business. He's an entrepreneur, he's a successful family man. He obviously loves his family.""Jose Uz, a 48-year-old native Miami resident of Cuban descent, told Breitbart News he's similarly impressed with Trump's business acumen. Yet Uz places even more weight on Trump's desire to help the country--without any competing interests other than his love for the United States.""I believe that Mr. Donald Trump is an individual that has the best interest for the United States, for America, and for its citizens,"" Uz, who runs the 2,600-member Facebook group Cubans4Trump, said in an interview. ""He doesn't need to prove anything, he doesn't need to become famous, he doesn't need to become rich, he is already there - on the contrary, this is actually something, when I view it, I say, my God, what a huge burden he has voluntarily placed on himself. It's almost to the point of masochism. He didn't need this, he has a privileged beautiful life. One that he has earned with his hard work and intelligence. Why would he do this? There is nothing for him to gain out of it. But there actually is, when you look deep into it. What he actually has to gain is ensuring and securing the future of his children, his grandchildren, and his great-grandchildren, and everybody else down the line, and all of us that are within the United States. He is going to secure us in the way of keeping us safe.""Joe Fernandez, a Cuban immigrant in his late 50s, told Breitbart News he supports Trump for similar reasons.""I believe he is a patriotic man, he knows a lot about international relationships, and business, he will bring some new ideas,"" Fernandez said. ""He looks like a tough guy. He is from New York. Now a days life is very strong [hard], a lot of difficult times. We need a strong man.""Ariel Martinez, a 42-year-old man from Havana now living in Florida whose father and other family members were political prisoners under the Castro regime in Cuba, supports Trump for president as well. He said there is broad support for Trump in the Cuban American community.""The Cuban American community supports Donald J. Trump as the candidate for Presidency because we would like to see America thrive again,"" Martinez told Breitbart News. ""We want to see God, American values, the love of Country, and Patriotism restored in our great nation. This is primarily important to us because we come from a system that the latter has been substituted for the corrupt ideology of communism. The freedoms in this country, under a two term Obama administration, are slowly being eroded toward a state of socialism and will lead us to a socialist nation. Which is simply a precursor to communism. We, the Cuban American community, believe that Hillary represents a third term of Obama's ideology which this country cannot afford. For us it is quite simple to see what is slowly unfolding in this great nation of ours because, we didn't learn it in a history book, we lived it and it is precisely where we are headed. We have found that Donald J. Trump has started a movement, here in South Florida, where all races from everywhere--Latinos, Hispanics, Blacks, Jews--have united as one force to show unwavering support for the presidential candidate. We do truly believe that we will witness a Reagan-like victory that will make history.""Hillary Rodham Clinton, on the other hand, does not fare so well in the Cuban community. When asked how Trump's opponent, Clinton, is viewed in the Cuban community in South Florida, Arias used a Spanish word to call her a ""witch.""""They call her a 'bruja,' basically,"" Arias said is what his friends and neighbors think of Hillary Clinton. ""She's the bruja mentirosa. Which means liar. She's a lying witch basically. We all know what rhymes with witch, though we're not going to get into that. She is typically viewed as a liar and dishonest and in it for herself, a typical career politician that doesn't care about the interests of the Cuban community--and doesn't care about the interests of Americans in general. She's mostly in it for her people and her foundation.""""I don't see her ready to take such an important position as President of the United States,"" Fernandez said of Clinton.Uz added that she has no idea how to manage the economy.""There is no politician out there especially Hillary Clinton who has any idea of how to manage money because they never actually earned any,"" Uz said. ""Whether it was ten million or one million, whatever he supposedly borrowed from his father, its no secret that he turned it into a multi-million dollar empire. It's not a thing about having money, its about knowing how to get that money make it multiply and make it grow. Its about put[ting] together organizations, how to manage them, how to put the right people in the right positions, know[ing] how to delegate to the right individuals and how to create jobs - how to be able to create an environment that is friendly for the individual to be able to sustain themselves and their families. Mr. Trump understands very well from having been inside big business his entire adult life, how special interest and cronyism actually works within the government and big business. Politicians don't know how to earn money, they only know how to take money from special interest groups and lobbyists and enrich themselves from doing favors. Their payouts come later on with consulting jobs and getting paid half a million dollars to speak half and hour to somebody or to a group of people.""The Cuban leaders found a recent media attack against Trump to be particularly gratuitous. Specifically, the allegation that has surfaced in recent weeks is that Trump was doing business in Cuba in the 1990s--when it was still illegal to do so. Arias brushed off the report, which came from a NewsWeek piece that claimed Trump was unlawfully doing business in Cuba, as a ""cheap attack.""""A cheap Democratic strategy,"" Arias said. ""And how convenient [for it to come] right after the first debate where he clearly dominated her?""Fernandez said the attack from NewsWeek was ""a lie.""""He tried to do business [with Cuba] but when he saw how things was, he stopped that immediately,"" Fernandez said.Over the course of the past several weeks, Breitbart News has conducted a number of interviews and traveled to a variety of Florida cities--and Trump events--to get a feel for how his campaign in the all-important Sunshine State is shaping up on the ground. For a time at the beginning of September, it seemed Trump had taken a lead in Florida--a CNN/ORC poll conducted after Labor Day had him up three points over Clinton while a JMC Analytics poll had him up four and a PPP poll and a Suffolk poll each had Trump leading by a single point. But a bevy of other surveys since then--a Monmouth poll showing Clinton up 5 points, a Mason-Dixon poll with her up 4 points, and New York Times and Fox 13 polls with her up one point in each--have come out dampening his momentum. A new Emerson poll in Florida has Trump up by 1 point, while Quinnipiac and University of North Florida polls have Trump down 5 points and 3 points respectively. A Breitbart News Network/Gravis Marketing survey at the beginning of October had a tie ball game at 46 percent apiece for Trump and Clinton, while the latest Breitbart/Gravis survey released a little over a week ago has Clinton up 4 in Florida with a 2.3 percent margin of error. A steady stream of surveys since over the middle of the month of October have shown Clinton with either a 4-point or three point lead. All told, the race here in Florida is close: The RealClearPolitics polling average shows Clinton, overall, leading Trump by under 4 percent-just inside or just outside all the polls' collective margins of error, too close for comfort for both candidates.Trump shocked the political world just a few short months ago when on March 15 he smoked the Sunshine State's favorite son Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) in the primary here, leading to the end of the Rubio campaign--once thought to be the campaign of the eventual would-be nominee--by nearly 20 percent. Rubio and Trump have since mostly buried the hatchet, and seem to be working together to win in November.Gruters, Trump's Florida co-chair who also serves as the vice chairman of the Florida GOP, dismissed any potential idea that there is conflict between Trump supporters and operatives loyal to Rubio. ""Because I'm a part of both organizations I know there is no daylight in between electing Donald Trump and Marco in Florida,"" Gruters explained. ""We all share the same goal of stopping Hillary Clinton and Patrick Murphy's dangerous agenda.""But the brutal primary left a bitter taste in some mouths of others throughout the state's GOP establishment. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, another of Trump's vanquished rivals who he went even harder against to defeat, has broken his pledge to the Republican Party and is refusing to endorse Trump for president. Several others in the Bush family, including Jeb's father former U.S. President George H.W. Bush and the senior Bush's granddaughter Barbara, are reportedly supporting Clinton for president.His campaign in the state here has shaken itself up post primaries, with Karen Giorno--his state director during the primaries who delivered a successful election night back on March 15--moving up to New York City while Susie Wiles has taken over the state's efforts in the general election. Giorno's move to New York came after reports that she confirmed to Politico that there were disagreements between her and other GOP officials on how to handle resource allocation for the general election.""I won't sugar coat it. I've had serious put professional disagreements with some colleagues about what offices should be open and how they should be rolled out. But there's nothing nefarious here,"" Giorno said after the move, according to Politico.Politico's Marc Caputo quoted Giorno as attributing some of the blame to ""bureaucratic red tape in getting leases signed and getting money out the door.""But, Giorno said in the early September report: ""Susie Wiles is a winner. She knows how to win.""Gruters told Breitbart News in hindsight that this move has proven to be a sign of the team's success, since Giorno has been invaluable--sources in the national campaign confirm to Breitbart News--up in New York while Wiles has been getting the trains moving on time in Florida.""Susie Wiles will take what Karen created and take Karen's team and make sure we win,"" Gruters said. ""I think Karen did a fantastic job. I credit Karen, I credit Susan, I credit the team, and I have no doubt we are going win.""The real question is--with such a bare-bones operation in the primaries, and a similarly skeletal operation in the general election--how did Trump win so big back on March 15? And why is he still in the game when Clinton is outspending him at an unbelievable clip? For anyone other than Trump, seemingly, the lack of support from such party luminaries as former presidents like the Bushes would be a deal-killer for their campaigns. But Trump, somehow, is hanging on-and has a chance here on Nov. 8. Maybe it is because the election isn't about him, but about an amorphous political movement that has gotten behind him since early in the primaries; a nationalist, populist movement that rejects the thinking of the political elite--and the status quo--and instead represents more of a grassroots rebellion against the political class than a typical Republican versus Democrat battle.At Trump's rallies throughout the state of Florida--and really everywhere in the country--he's drawing thousands and thousands of people, many of whom never have been involved in politics before. Trump's strategy, aides note, seems to be focused on targeting the most expensive battleground state's ten separate media markets with massive rallies, taking whatever earned media he can get, and building excitement on a grassroots level via social media and making rallies as fun as they can. At a recent rally up in the I-4 corridor of Melbourne, Florida, near Orlando, for instance, three millennial women told Breitbart News that Trump's plan is working.On Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, Trump is criss-crossing the Sunshine State yet again with a rally in Naples on Sunday, rallies in St. Augustine and Tampa on Monday and a rally in Sanford on Tuesday. Trump seems to gather his non-traditional campaign style from his career in business. He does not look at campaigning like a traditional politician, and he baffled the pundits and political consultants throughout the primaries by successfully storming his way to the nomination with less than 100 staffers compared to what amounted to standing armies his opponents like Rubio and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) had built. Since he has become the GOP nominee, he has rounded his campaign out with many more staff nationwide--at the headquarters up at Trump Tower in New York City and throughout the states like this--but he still has that businessman mentality at heart. The challenge he faces is building a winning campaign without losing his flair, and without sacrificing his style. Trump's Florida team, despite the usual suspects in the prognosticating business bashing them, says everything is going according to plan.""The media is pushing this narrative that Hillary should be winning because she has more brick-and-mortar offices than we do,"" Gruters said. ""We only had two brick-and-mortar offices in the primary and we won 66 of 67 counties. We are going to knock on 120,000 doors just this Saturday alone.""Recent reports from anti-Trump publications in the progressive media--including Politico, the Huffington Post, and the New York Times--have suggested that Trump is not organized in Florida.""The story told by the media is that we have no ground game in Florida,"" Gruters said in an email. ""As our boss likes to say, 'the proof is in the pudding.'""Gruters detailed for Breitbart News exactly what is going on in the state for Trump:Meanwhile, while Trump builds his army and his momentum--all while crashing through Florida whenever possible with major thousands-strong rallies--Clinton is slipping. Even the New York Times recently lamented her dreary Florida weather in an article titled: ""Hillary Clinton Struggles To Gain Traction in Florida, Despite Spending.""""Hillary Clinton has vastly outspent Donald J. Trump on TV ads in Florida. Her 57 campaign offices dwarf Mr. Trump's afterthought of a ground game. And Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular among Hispanics, who account for nearly one in five Florida voters,"" Trip Gabriel wrote for the Times on Sept. 17 under that headline. ""Despite these advantages, Mrs. Clinton is struggling in the Sunshine State, unable to assemble the coalition that gave Barack Obama two victories here, and offering Mr. Trump a broad opening in a road to the White House that not long ago seemed closed to him. Mr. Trump is pressing down hard to win the state, campaigning in Miami on Friday and in Fort Myers on Monday, after a rally in Pensacola recently.""Politico came out with a hit even harder more than a week later, just a few days ago, writing in a headline that Clinton was in ""panic mode"" with black voters in Florida.""To kill Donald Trump's chances of capturing the White House, Hillary Clinton needs to win Florida. And to do that, she needs a big minority turnout,"" Marc Caputo and Daniel Ducassi wrote on Sept. 28 in Politico. ""But Democrats are beginning to worry that too many African-American voters are uninspired by Clinton's candidacy, leading her campaign to hit the panic button this week and launch an all-out blitz to juice-up voter enthusiasm.""Trump is bolstering pre-existing establishment political infrastructure with energy, enthusiasm, new voters, and motivated volunteers. The Trump campaign is depending on that infrastructure to provide the ground game for voter engagement and turnout.Trump's primary campaign outperformed the primary campaigns of both Sen. John McCain in 2008 and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney in 2012. Andy Badolato, who in addition to contributing to Breitbart News serves as an elected GOP committeeman in Sarasota County  in Florida, explained it this way: ""Trump set new primary GOP records in Florida receiving almost 50 percent more votes than Romney did in 2012 despite running against Florida resident favorites Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson as well as defeating handily Ted Cruz.""Badolato added that Gruters has been crucial to the whole effort.""Joe Gruters demonstrated courage and leadership in the face of great personal risk and political adversity in backing Trump very early and leading his campaign in Florida,"" Badolato said. ""Joe was ostracized, ridiculed and attempts were made by his own peers and close friends to oust him out of many organizations and associations. Joe Gruters recognized the issues of what the Florida electorate really wanted and it was clearly not an establishment candidate.""According to Gruters, he started supporting Trump after presenting Trump with the Sarasota Republican Party's ""Statesman of the Year"" award in 2012. ""I knew early on that Trump is going to be our President, he's an agent of change and he's going to give all of us a chance,"" Gruters said. ""Every time something negative came out it just further convinced me that I had made the right call. All the comments, negativity, and everything else just made me stronger because I knew in 2012 Trump was special.""For Gruters, all the credit goes to the ""all star"" Florida campaign team and the man at the top of the ticket. ""Trump is going to be one of the best President's we've ever had and it all gets to two things, security and jobs and the economy,"" Gruters said.But while the campaign staff and party players sort out the details, what seems to keep Trump afloat right next to Clinton is that completely organic ""movement"" that people like Arias represent. To further highlight the opposition to Clinton--and support for Trump--in Miami's Cuban community, Arias invited Breitbart News cameras to follow him as he stumped for Trump in Little Havana in Miami.And Uz, similarly, has a message for all his fellow Cuban Americans throughout South Florida.""This is the last stop,"" Uz warns his friends and neighbors. ""If we lose America there is no place else to go. You were lucky enough when you lost Cuba, you had a generous wonderful country, that opened its arms to all of us and allowed you to come in [and] establish your families, expand your education, open businesses, raise your children in freedom, and to live a prosperous good life. If we lose America to socialism, there is no where else to go. Please, please don't be stupid, don't listen to the rhetoric. Fidel Castro killed millions of Cubans with his rhetoric, and we fell for it. Please don't fall for it twice.""

SIGN UPMIAMI, Florida -- Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump's unorthodox campaign in Florida is still neck-and-neck with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the latest polls, despite being outmatched in spending in this critical battleground state. The race remains close in large part thanks to the ""movement"" he often references from the stage at his rallies nationwide.Over the past several weeks, Breitbart News has spent time with a variety of Trump backers in Florida--ranging from his campaign's state co-chairman and Florida GOP vice chairman Joe Gruters to grassroots activists and die hard supporters--to figure out what exactly is driving Trump's appeal in a state with 29 electoral votes critical to either candidate's White House chances.Carlos Arias, a second-generation Cuban-American and die hard Donald Trump supporter, is a Miami native who works as a biomedical professor by day. But, by night, he is on his own dime and with his own time building support for the Trump campaign in the Cuban community here--using traditional grassroots organizing tactics, and newer ones through social media. As part of his effort, Arias manages the Cubans for Trump Facebook page. But he also walks the streets of Little Havana working his friends, family, and neighbors over to Team Trump.""What's there not to support about the guy?"" Arias told Breitbart News in a sit-down interview before taking reporters on the streets with him. ""I mean, he's an amazing leader. He's a very intelligent guy. He has an expertise for making deals, for making trade deals, for the economy, for money, for running business. He's an entrepreneur, he's a successful family man. He obviously loves his family.""Jose Uz, a 48-year-old native Miami resident of Cuban descent, told Breitbart News he's similarly impressed with Trump's business acumen. Yet Uz places even more weight on Trump's desire to help the country--without any competing interests other than his love for the United States.""I believe that Mr. Donald Trump is an individual that has the best interest for the United States, for America, and for its citizens,"" Uz, who runs the 2,600-member Facebook group Cubans4Trump, said in an interview. ""He doesn't need to prove anything, he doesn't need to become famous, he doesn't need to become rich, he is already there - on the contrary, this is actually something, when I view it, I say, my God, what a huge burden he has voluntarily placed on himself. It's almost to the point of masochism. He didn't need this, he has a privileged beautiful life. One that he has earned with his hard work and intelligence. Why would he do this? There is nothing for him to gain out of it. But there actually is, when you look deep into it. What he actually has to gain is ensuring and securing the future of his children, his grandchildren, and his great-grandchildren, and everybody else down the line, and all of us that are within the United States. He is going to secure us in the way of keeping us safe.""Joe Fernandez, a Cuban immigrant in his late 50s, told Breitbart News he supports Trump for similar reasons.""I believe he is a patriotic man, he knows a lot about international relationships, and business, he will bring some new ideas,"" Fernandez said. ""He looks like a tough guy. He is from New York. Now a days life is very strong [hard], a lot of difficult times. We need a strong man.""Ariel Martinez, a 42-year-old man from Havana now living in Florida whose father and other family members were political prisoners under the Castro regime in Cuba, supports Trump for president as well. He said there is broad support for Trump in the Cuban American community.""The Cuban American community supports Donald J. Trump as the candidate for Presidency because we would like to see America thrive again,"" Martinez told Breitbart News. ""We want to see God, American values, the love of Country, and Patriotism restored in our great nation. This is primarily important to us because we come from a system that the latter has been substituted for the corrupt ideology of communism. The freedoms in this country, under a two term Obama administration, are slowly being eroded toward a state of socialism and will lead us to a socialist nation. Which is simply a precursor to communism. We, the Cuban American community, believe that Hillary represents a third term of Obama's ideology which this country cannot afford. For us it is quite simple to see what is slowly unfolding in this great nation of ours because, we didn't learn it in a history book, we lived it and it is precisely where we are headed. We have found that Donald J. Trump has started a movement, here in South Florida, where all races from everywhere--Latinos, Hispanics, Blacks, Jews--have united as one force to show unwavering support for the presidential candidate. We do truly believe that we will witness a Reagan-like victory that will make history."" Hillary Rodham Clinton, on the other hand, does not fare so well in the Cuban community. When asked how Trump's opponent, Clinton, is viewed in the Cuban community in South Florida, Arias used a Spanish word to call her a ""witch.""""They call her a 'bruja,' basically,"" Arias said is what his friends and neighbors think of Hillary Clinton. ""She's the bruja mentirosa. Which means liar. She's a lying witch basically. We all know what rhymes with witch, though we're not going to get into that. She is typically viewed as a liar and dishonest and in it for herself, a typical career politician that doesn't care about the interests of the Cuban community--and doesn't care about the interests of Americans in general. She's mostly in it for her people and her foundation.""""I don't see her ready to take such an important position as President of the United States,"" Fernandez said of Clinton.Uz added that she has no idea how to manage the economy.""There is no politician out there especially Hillary Clinton who has any idea of how to manage money because they never actually earned any,"" Uz said. ""Whether it was ten million or one million, whatever he supposedly borrowed from his father, its no secret that he turned it into a multi-million dollar empire. It's not a thing about having money, its about knowing how to get that money make it multiply and make it grow. Its about put[ting] together organizations, how to manage them, how to put the right people in the right positions, know[ing] how to delegate to the right individuals and how to create jobs - how to be able to create an environment that is friendly for the individual to be able to sustain themselves and their families. Mr. Trump understands very well from having been inside big business his entire adult life, how special interest and cronyism actually works within the government and big business. Politicians don't know how to earn money, they only know how to take money from special interest groups and lobbyists and enrich themselves from doing favors. Their payouts come later on with consulting jobs and getting paid half a million dollars to speak half and hour to somebody or to a group of people.""The Cuban leaders found a recent media attack against Trump to be particularly gratuitous. Specifically, the allegation that has surfaced in recent weeks is that Trump was doing business in Cuba in the 1990s--when it was still illegal to do so. Arias brushed off the report, which came from a NewsWeek piece that claimed Trump was unlawfully doing business in Cuba, as a ""cheap attack.""""A cheap Democratic strategy,"" Arias said. ""And how convenient [for it to come] right after the first debate where he clearly dominated her?""Fernandez said the attack from NewsWeek was ""a lie.""""He tried to do business [with Cuba] but when he saw how things was, he stopped that immediately,"" Fernandez said.Over the course of the past several weeks, Breitbart News has conducted a number of interviews and traveled to a variety of Florida cities--and Trump events--to get a feel for how his campaign in the all-important Sunshine State is shaping up on the ground. For a time at the beginning of September, it seemed Trump had taken a lead in Florida--a CNN/ORC poll conducted after Labor Day had him up three points over Clinton while a JMC Analytics poll had him up four and a PPP poll and a Suffolk poll each had Trump leading by a single point. But a bevy of other surveys since then--a Monmouth poll showing Clinton up 5 points, a Mason-Dixon poll with her up 4 points, and New York Times and Fox 13 polls with her up one point in each--have come out dampening his momentum. A new Emerson poll in Florida has Trump up by 1 point, while Quinnipiac and University of North Florida polls have Trump down 5 points and 3 points respectively. A Breitbart News Network/Gravis Marketing survey at the beginning of October had a tie ball game at 46 percent apiece for Trump and Clinton, while the latest Breitbart/Gravis survey released a little over a week ago has Clinton up 4 in Florida with a 2.3 percent margin of error. A steady stream of surveys since over the middle of the month of October have shown Clinton with either a 4-point or three point lead. All told, the race here in Florida is close: The RealClearPolitics polling average shows Clinton, overall, leading Trump by under 4 percent-just inside or just outside all the polls' collective margins of error, too close for comfort for both candidates.Trump shocked the political world just a few short months ago when on March 15 he smoked the Sunshine State's favorite son Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) in the primary here, leading to the end of the Rubio campaign--once thought to be the campaign of the eventual would-be nominee--by nearly 20 percent.

Her statement was in reference to the Heller decision, so Wallace asked if she would explain why she believed the decision was a mistake.Clinton said:I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns. So they wanted people with guns to safely store them.Clinton also admitted being ""upset"" by the decision and reiterated her suggestion that toddlers would be endangered by it.WSJ quoted Clinton saying the Supreme Court's decision represented a rejection of ""reasonable regulation."" Then WSJ showed that her claim ""glossed over the thrust of the city's gun law, which effectively barred private ownership of handguns."" In other words, Heller was not about toddlers but about the nature of the fundamental rights protected by the Second Amendment.WSJ quoted a Clinton spokesman who attempted to justify the anti-Heller statements by ""[noting] that attorneys for the District of Columbia did argue in the case that the city's weapons regulations were meant to protect children."" But the paper explains that even though ""the high court's majority did consider a secondary question about the storage of firearms, ...[that consideration was] only in the context of the right of a citizen to use a handgun for self-defense.""Again, Heller was about the nature of fundamental rights, not about toddlers.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of ""Bullets with AWR Hawkins,"" a Breitbart News podcast.

""Can you imagine if she's President what's going to happen to the country? It's going to be terrible NAFTA deals on steroids, pay-to-play, the entire White House is going to be for sale. It's a nightmare. Those policies have caused this problem right in our area.""Tenney, who is running for the U.S. House seat in New York's 22nd Congressional district, explained that Clinton ""promised 200,000 jobs when she was running for Senate"" in 2000, but Tenney says Clinton failed to deliver. Instead ""we've lost probably three or four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs out of the state,"" Tenney said. ""We have the largest out migration of population. We have some of the highest taxes, probably the highest taxes in the nation. We have the second highest energy costs. We are the least free state in the country.""Tenney told Breitbart that there are ""very few manufactures left in central New York"" as a result of the trade policies backed by Clinton such as NAFTA.My grandfather started [our family business] 70 years ago in 1946 right in the heart of [New York's 22nd Congressional District]... We do pharmaceutical packaging... but our business is a perfect example: we are one of the very few manufactures left in central New York because of NAFTA. We actually lost jobs because of these bad trade deals... We had a customer who was in New York that moved to Mexico because of a Mexico trade deal and now we lost about $800,000 a year in manufacturing on our side... but it's happening not just to us, but to businesses all over. Every day you read in the papers about somebody leaving for other areas.New York state, Tenney explained, has become ""the home of corporate welfare, we're the home of crony capitalism, of pay-to-play. I mean, just look at what has happened in New York state... And who is the biggest, croniest corporate welfare, pay-to-play person besides Andrew Cuomo? Hillary Clinton. And she's running for president.""Multiple reports have confirmed Clinton's failure to deliver the type of job growth she had promised her constituents. In August, the Washington Post reported on Clinton's record in a piece titled, ""As Senator, Clinton Promised 200,000 Jobs in Upstate New York. Her Efforts Fell Flat."" The Washington Post wrote:Despite Clinton's efforts, upstate job growth stagnated overall during her tenure, with manufacturing jobs plunging nearly 25 percent, according to jobs data. The former first lady was unable to pass the big-ticket legislation she introduced to benefit the upstate economy. She turned to smaller-scale projects, but some of those fell flat after initial glowing headlines, a Washington Post review shows. Many promised jobs never materialized and others migrated to other states as she turned to her first presidential run, said former officials who worked with her in New York. Clinton's self-styled role as economic promoter also showcases an operating style that has come to define the political and money-making machine known to some critics of the former first couple as Clinton Inc. Some of her pet economic projects involved loyal campaign contributors, who also supported the Clinton Foundation.The report also highlighted Clinton's decision to join forces with the controversial Indian outsourcing firm, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), and help Tata open a a software development center in Buffalo. Clinton, who then co-chaired the Senate India Caucus, ""came under fire for aligning with a global leader in outsourcing that relied heavily on foreign workers who were in the United States on temporary visas,"" the Washington Post wrote, further noting that:Clinton defended outsourcing, telling CNN in 2004, ""You know, outsourcing does work both ways.''Ron Hira, an outsourcing critic then in Rochester, branded the Tata deal an obvious Clinton outreach to ""the Indian American donor class.""""From an economic development perspective, bringing in Tata was just a terrible idea,"" said Hira, an Indian American who is a professor at Howard University.Interestingly, the Washington Post notes that Tata has donated tens of thousands of dollars to the Clinton Foundation: ""Although foreign nationals cannot contribute to U.S. campaigns, Clinton has won campaign support from the Indian American community, records show. And Tata has remained friendly to the Clintons. Tata Consultancy Services contributed between $25,000 and $50,000 to the Clinton Foundation, and Ratan Tata, then chairman of the Tata Group, was a speaker at the Clinton Global Initiative conference in 2010.""My grandfather started [our family business] 70 years ago in 1946 right in the heart of [New York's 22nd Congressional District]...

He wasn't nervous. He never seemed to care. I seemed to care more about people finding out or in some cases even Hillary and Chelsea then he did. I would bring it up to him. And he [would] vow, 'No everything is going to be fine. Don't worry about it.'""Flowers was speaking in an interview set to air Sunday night on this reporter's talk radio program broadcast on New York's AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM.Listen to audio here:Flowers said that she and Clinton also often engaged in phone sex and she claimed that the two had sex in numerous places. ""I had sex in the office when he was governor,"" she said. ""In the mansion, in his office, and in the conference room. With people outside.""""We had a lot of fun together. We were two consenting adults,"" she added.The issue of so-called locker room talk has dominated the news cycle after a 2005 audio and video recording was leaked of Donald Trump making controversial comments about women.Flowers was asked whether she ever heard Clinton engaged in ""locker room talk.""""So, you know, sometimes we had phone sex,"" she stated. ""So yeah. We were engaged in a lot of locker room talk. And he did with his friends and his associates like Roger Perry.""Perry was a former State Trooper who gave interviews and later a deposition in which he stated that he used to help Clinton manage his alleged extramarital affairs.In our interview, Flowers identified Perry as the state trooper who ""drive Bill around and brought him to my home often.""She said she heard that Perry was ""told by Bill that I could suck a tennis ball through a garden hose.""That salacious anecdote was mentioned in a 1996 New York Times bestselling book by R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr. titled, Boy Clinton: The Political Biography.Page 278 states:...Bill later told his close aide, Arkansas state trooper Roger Perry, that Gennifer ""could suck a tennis ball through a garden hose.""In a recent interview with this reporter, Flowers stated that Hillary ""absolutely"" knew about the alleged affair as early as 1977, when Flowers says the affair began.She stated:""I know she did because there was a security guard at the mansion. Back then we didn't have cell phones. So he (Bill Clinton) would have key people - whether it be Betsy Wright or a security guard at the mansion - for me to call and ask for and then that person would get a message to him to call me back.""And one day he came in and the security guard told him that I had called and gave him the message. And what he didn't know was that she (Hillary) was actually there and was walking up to meet him and heard the guard say my name. And that I had called. And so she had a conversation with him a little bit later that she was getting real tired of hearing that name. And that she wanted it to stop. And he told her it wasn't gonna stop. And she said, 'Well, Just at least don't embarrass me.' Well of course he went on to embarrass her. Many, many times.""They had only been married about three months when he and I started our affair. You know, they didn't have Chelsea. It started early on in their relationship as well.""Flowers never sought to go public. Her name was put out there against her will when former Clinton insider Larry Nichols, who claimed he was improperly dismissed by Clinton from a state job, mentioned Flowers in court documents. In a lawsuit, Nichols alleged that Clinton diverted state funds to engage in extramarital affairs with five women, and he named Flowers, and four others, including former Miss America Elizabeth Ward Gracen and former Miss Arkansas Lencola Sullivan.Nichols would later drop his lawsuit, but the charges helped form the basis for tabloid stories alleging that Clinton had extramarital affairs, including with Flowers.Three days after Star magazine mentioned Flowers as Clinton's alleged mistress, Bill and Hillary Clinton appeared in January 1992 side by side on 60 Minutes, where Bill denied a relationship with Flowers.To protect her reputation, Flowers held a press conference the next day where she played excerpts from tape recordings she had made of private phone calls with Clinton. In a deposition in 1998, Bill Clinton admitted he had a sexual encounter with Flowers.Aaron Klein is Breitbart's Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

The past eight years have pushed us $20 trillion into debt, obligations that will burden our children and grandchildren. The nation's economy sputters under the growing weight of federal edicts and regulations that smother growth and innovation. Obamacare threatens to crash and burn. The middle class struggles. An administration promising hope and unity instead brought division.Yet Hillary Clinton promises to lead us down the same path. She'll cuddle up to the ways and perks of Washington like she would to a cozy old blanket.Mr. Trump instead brings a corporate sensibility and a steadfast determination to an ossified Beltway culture. He advocates for lower taxes and a simplified tax code, in contrast to his opponent's plan to extract another $1 trillion from the private economy in order to enlarge the bureaucracy. Mr. Trump understands and appreciates the conditions that lead to prosperity and job creation and would be a friend to small business and entrepreneurship. Mrs. Clinton has spent most of her adult life on the public payroll.[N]either candidate will ever be called to the dais to accept an award for moral probity and character. And we are already distressingly familiar with the Clinton way, which involves turning public service into an orgy of influence peddling and entitlement designed to line their own pockets -- precisely what a disgruntled electorate now rises up to protest.Mr. Trump represents neither the danger his critics claim nor the magic elixir many of his supporters crave. But he promises to be a source of disruption and discomfort to the privileged, back-scratching political elites for whom the nation's strength and solvency have become subservient to power's pursuit and preservation.Donald Trump for president.Read the rest of the article here.SIGN UP

The memo covered up embarrassing data about the staffers' ranking of the organization's efficiency and downplayed their concerns as ""constructive criticisms.""The memo states: ""Interviewees were asked, among other things, to rate the effectiveness and efficiency of the Foundation's operations."" However, the results on ""efficiency"" do not appear in the talking points.The reason for the omission is pretty obvious. The actual review states that staffers rated the Foundation's ""efficiency"" as 1 out of 10 at worst and 4 out of 10 at best.When we asked interviewees to rate the effectiveness and efficiency of the Foundation's operations on a scale of 1 to 10, many elected to give different ratings for effectiveness and efficiency. They rated the effectiveness in the 7-to-8 range based on the number of people receiving life-saving drugs through CHAI, the agreements negotiated by the Alliance with the beverage companies, and/or the commitments made through CGI. However, these same interviewees rated the current efficiency of the Foundation at a low 1-to-4 level.The talking points instead reveal only the higher marks for ""effectiveness.""A.                Interviewees uniformly praised the effectiveness of the Foundation and its affiliates, noting the enormous amount they have accomplished over a ten-year period, including building the Presidential library in Little Rock, the number of people receiving life-saving drugs through CHAI, the agreements negotiated by the Alliance with the beverage companies, and the commitments made through CGI.B.                 Interviewees also shared with Simpson, and Simpson shared with the Board, certain constructive criticisms.  These included:*         the need for the Foundation to develop the infrastructure necessary to support a best-in-class organization;*         the need for greater Board and management oversight;*         the need for more strategic and budgetary planning; and,*         the need for clearer policy guidance and enforcement to manage potential conflicts of interest.In subsequent years, many of these same concerns continued to plague the Foundation. Doug Band, a board member of the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), complained in 2015 -- well into Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign -- that he had to sign a conflict of interest policy but Bill Clinton did not, ""even though he is personally paid by 3 cgi sponsors, gets many expensive gifts from them, some that are at home etc.""The memo also tells employees that the review recommended that management ""adopt a clear gift acceptance policy and procedures to ensure that all donors are properly vetted."" However, a 2013 memo publicly available on the Foundation website suggests the organization had not yet taken any action.When we asked interviewees to rate the effectiveness and efficiency of the Foundation's operations on a scale of 1 to 10, many elected to give different ratings for effectiveness and efficiency.
