We live with our beliefs. Tehran will never recognize Israel.""However, according to the report, Nobakht said Gabriel had told him the media had misconstrued his comments.""When Gabriel came to Iran, I asked him why he has said such a thing while he is one of the pioneering officials who came to Iran after the nuclear deal? He clearly said that they (the media) had distorted his comments. He said that he has come to Iran now without any precondition and that they respect Iran's views,"" said Mohammad Baqer Nobakht.Iran's judiciary chief on Tuesday reacted to Gabriel's comments in Der Spiegel by saying that he would have barred Gabriel from visiting the country if it was within his power.""The German economy minister has made incorrect and illogical comments and said that if Iran wants to open the way for trade interactions, it should recognize Israel. Apparently, he is asleep and doesn't know that Iran has tolerated abundant pressures for the sake of its beliefs for over 30 years to resist against such demands,"" said Iran's judiciary chief Sadeq Amoli Larijani, according to the Fars News Agency.""Were I in the place of the government and the foreign minister, I would not allow this minister to visit Iran,"" he added.Gabriel met with some 120 business representatives and his Iranian counterpart.Iran's Foreign Ministry said it would never forsake its support of the Palestinians, according to the official Iranian news outlet Press TV.""Ties between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Germany are based on mutual respect and interests, and no precondition would be acceptable in this regard,"" Bahram Qasemi, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said.""The Islamic Republic considers defending the rights of the people of Palestine to be a fixed plank of its foreign policy and will never and under no circumstances forsake the Palestinian cause,"" Qasemi said.Gabriel, who met with his Iranian counterpart and over a hundred other business representatives, said that Germany supports Iran's push to join the World Trade Organization.Hoping to restore its status as one of Iran's primary trading partners, Germany is one of the first countries to send a delegation to Tehran to explore post-sanction ties.SIGN UP"

If only a single [Israeli] shell would strike anywhere in this country, so that we can flatten Tel Aviv.""Rafighdoost also claimed that the leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Khomeini established Hezbollah in Lebanon to promote Islamization in other countries.

""They are unhappy with the economy. They are not happy with American foreign policy. And when you get down through the specifics to the broader issues ...

Mike Pence, the GOP's vice presidential nominee, dominated his Democratic counterpart Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) in the only debate between the two before the election at Longwood University.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""Gov. Pence was flawless,"" Jason Miller, the senior communications adviser to Pence's running mate Donald J. Trump, told Breitbart News. ""Tonight showed the strength of the Trump-Pence ticket and that our ideas are better for America. And ultimately, it showed the good judgment Donald Trump has in selecting such a strong number two in Gov. Pence.""Pence's win came on a night where the Democratic presidential ticket of Hillary Rodham Clinton and Kaine were set back significantly after a smooth past week since the first of three Trump-Clinton debates at Hofstra University last Monday. Trump, under fire from Clinton and her allies in the legacy establishment media since the last debate, has clawed his way back from the brink yet again with a series of successful rallies during the weekend, culminating with a major pair of appearances in Colorado on Monday evening. But it was Pence's performance at the vice presidential debate, moderated by CBS News' Elaine Quijano, that has put new spring in the Trump camp's step heading into the next all-important debate on Sunday evening in St. Louis.Pence took command of the stage from the outset. After both Kaine and Pence gave satisfactory answers to a fundamental question about readiness for the presidential job should that need ever arise, the first real question of the debate to Kaine from Quijano set the tone off the bat.""Senator Kaine, on the campaign trail, you praised Secretary Clinton's character, including her commitment to public service, yet 60 percent of voters don't think she's trustworthy. Why do so many people distrust her? Is it because they have questions about her emails and the Clinton Foundation?"" Quijano asked Kaine.In his answer, Kaine refused to defend Clinton at all on the Clinton Foundation--the source of controversy for perhaps the Clinton political dynasty's biggest scandals, the Clinton Cash narrative--and wouldn't defend her use of a private email server either.Instead, when trying to explain why he trusts Clinton when so many Americans do not, he quickly pivoted the answer into an attack on Donald Trump instead--without giving any substantial evidence for why anyone should trust his running mate. When Pence got a similar question as a follow-up, he seized the moment to frame Kaine and Clinton as simply hurlers of insults running a policy-free campaign.""Let me say first and foremost that, Senator, you and Hillary Clinton would know a lot about an insult-driven campaign,"" Pence said, calmly and coolly, directly challenging Kaine. ""It really is remarkable.""As Pence proceeded to detail the many failures of Hillary Clinton's time in government, Kaine interrupted him many times with what seemed to be petty interjections. All told, all evening, Kaine would interrupt Pence or the moderator Quijano scores of times--70 in some counts.As Kaine unsuccessfully attempted to steal the momentum from Pence, the Indiana Governor joked playfully, ""I must have hit a nerve here."" Kaine would spend the next minute or so continually trying to talk over Pence and failing, as Quijano eventually cut him off and told him he would eventually get a chance to respond.At one point in this early exchange, in one of his many interruptions, Kaine declared it was his turn to talk. ""Okay, now I can weigh in,"" Kaine said, before Quijano held him back again: ""Senator, you have an opportunity to respond.""When he finally got a word in, Kaine claimed all was rosy on planet earth--claiming the status quo as his and Clinton's campaign mantlepiece. ""Governor Pence -- Governor Pence doesn't think the world's going so well, and he, you know, is going to say it's everybody's fault,"" Kaine implored, to which Pence simply retorted, ""Do you?""Kaine then tried to take credit--on Clinton's behalf--for killing Osama bin Laden, the 9/11 mastermind and al-Qaeda leader, even though she was not responsible for taking down bin Laden.""Let me tell you this: When Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, Governor Pence, did you know that Osama bin Laden was alive?"" Kaine said.""Yes,"" Pence replied.After that rocky start, Kaine never recovered--and Pence toyed with him all night while speaking directly into the cameras for the millions at home watching to hear his policy-focused agenda. When the conversation turned to the economy, Pence delivered perhaps his best lines of the night--where he clearly laid out the success of his conservative economic policies as Indiana's governor while subtly, but pointedly, undermining Kaine's weaknesses from his time as Virginia's governor.""I think the fact that -- that under this past administration of which Hillary Clinton was a part, we've almost doubled the national debt is atrocious,"" Pence said. He added:I mean, I'm very proud of the fact that -- I come from a state that works. The state of Indiana has balanced budgets. We cut taxes, we've made record investments in education and in infrastructure, and I still finish my term with $2 billion in the bank. That's a little bit different than when Senator Kaine was governor here in Virginia. He actually -- he actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion. He left his state about $2 billion in the hole. In the state of Indiana, we've cut unemployment in half; unemployment doubled when he was governor. But I think he's a very fitting running mate for Hillary Clinton because in the wake of a season where American families are struggling in this economy under the weight of higher taxes and Obamacare and the war on coal and the stifling avalanche of regulation coming out of this administration, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same. It really is remarkable that they actually are advocating a trillion dollars in tax increases, which I get that. You tried to raise taxes here in Virginia and were unsuccessful. But a trillion dollars in tax increases, more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan. But Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare. They want to expand it into a single-payer program. And for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start. Look, Donald Trump and I have a plan to get this economy moving again just the way that it worked in the 1980s, just the way it worked in the 1960s, and that is by lowering taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms, ending the war on coal that is hurting jobs and hurting this economy even here in Virginia, repealing Obamacare lock, stock, and barrel, and repealing all of the executive orders that Barack Obama has signed that are stifling economic growth in this economy. We can get America moving again. Put on top of that the kind of trade deals that'll put the American worker first, and you've got a prescription for real growth. And when you get the economy growing, Elaine, that's when you can deal with the national debt. When we get back to 3.5 percent to 4 percent growth, which Donald Trump's plan will do, then we're going to have the resources to meet our nation's needs at home and abroad, and we're going to have the ability to bring down the national debt.In his answer, Kaine started with a canned catch line that did not go over well.""On the economy, there's a fundamental choice for the American electorate,"" Kaine said. ""Do you want a 'you're hired' president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a 'you're fired' president in Donald Trump? I think that's not such a hard choice.""From there, Kaine struggled to detail his and Clinton's economic plans--then admitted that there's tax hikes in them--before spending the rest of, and the majority of in total, his answer attacking Trump, rather than telling the audience about their own plans.Whenever Kaine or Quijano tried to shift the conversation back to Trump's tax returns, as they often did throughout the night, Pence handled them with ease.""Well, this is probably the difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine. And, I mean, Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine -- God bless you for it, career public servants, that's great -- Donald Trump is a businessman, not a career politician. He actually built a business,"" Pence said when Quijano pressed him on the matter for the second time, specifically about Trump's illegally obtained tax documents from 1995 that The New York Times had published during the weekend. ""Those tax returns that ... came out publicly this week show that he faced some pretty tough times 20 years ago. But like virtually every other business, including The New York Times not too long ago, he used what's called net operating loss. We have a tax code, Senator, that actually is designed to encourage entrepreneurship in this country.""After more back and forth on the taxes--during which Pence swatted away attack after attack-- and a brief exchange on Social Security, Quijano moved the conversation to the issue of community-police relations. Pence hit another home run.""You know, my uncle was a cop, a career cop, on the beat in downtown Chicago. He was my hero when I was growing up. And we'd go up to visit my dad's family in Chicago. My three brothers and I would marvel at my uncle when he would come out in his uniform, sidearm at his side,"" he said, before broadly defending police officers:Police officers are the best of us. And the men and women, white, African American, Asian, Latino, Hispanic, they put their lives on the line every single day. And let me say, at the risk of agreeing with you, community policing is a great idea. It's worked in the Hoosier state. And we fully support that.Donald Trump and I are going to make sure that law enforcement have the resources and the tools to be able to really restore law and order to the cities and communities in this nation. It's probably -- probably why the 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Donald Trump as the next President of the United States of America, because they see his commitment to them. They see his commitment to law and order.But they also -- they also hear the bad-mouthing, the bad-mouthing that comes from people that seize upon tragedy in the wake of police action shootings as -- as a reason to -- to use a broad brush to accuse law enforcement of -- of implicit bias or institutional racism. And that really has got to stop.I mean, when an African American police officer in Charlotte named Brentley Vinson, an all-star football player who went to Liberty University here in the state, came home, followed his dad into law enforcement, joined the force in Charlotte, joined the force in Charlotte in 2014, was involved in a police action shooting that claimed the life of Keith -- Keith Lamont Scott, it was a tragedy. I mean, I -- we -- we mourn with those who mourn. We -- we grieve with those who grieve. And we're saddened at the loss of life.But Hillary Clinton actually referred to that moment as an example of implicit bias in the police force, where -- where she used -- when she was asked in the debate a week ago whether there was implicit bias in law enforcement, her only answer was that there's implicit bias in everyone in the United States.Next up was immigration, and it was here where Pence delivered the best line of the night--but first Pence, in depth, detailed exactly what Donald Trump's immigration plan is:Donald Trump's laid out a plan to end illegal immigration once and for all in this country. We've been talking it to death for 20 years. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to continue the policies of open borders, amnesty, catch and release, sanctuary cities, all the things that are driving -- that are driving wages down in this country, Senator, and also too often with criminal aliens in the country, it's bringing heartbreak.But I -- Donald Trump has a plan that he laid out in Arizona, that will deal systemically with illegal immigration, beginning with border security, internal enforcement. It's probably why for the first time in the history of Immigration and Customs Enforcement their union actually endorsed Donald Trump as the next President of the United States because they know they need help to enforce the laws of this country.And Donald Trump has laid out a priority to remove criminal aliens, remove people that have overstayed their visas. And -- and once we have accomplished all of that, which will -- which will strengthen our economy, strengthen the rule of law in the country and make our communities safer once the criminal aliens are out, then we'll deal with those that remain.But I have to tell you, I just -- I was listening to the avalanche of insults coming out of Senator Kaine a minute ago.Kaine, attempting again to interrupt Pence, was stopped by the Indiana Governor who reminded him it was his time to speak. Quijano confirmed Pence still had the floor, and then Kaine apologized for interrupting yet again.""I apologize. It's your two minutes. I apologize,"" Kaine said.""Thanks. I forgive you,"" Pence replied.That's when Pence, sensing a Kaine weakened from overextending throughout the debate to this point, stuck the knife in his opponent.""He says ours is an insult-driven campaign. Did you all just hear that? Ours is an insult-driven campaign?"" Pence said, adding:I mean, to be honest with you, if Donald Trump had said all of the things that you've said he said in the way you said he said them, he still wouldn't have a fraction of the insults that Hillary Clinton leveled when she said that half of our supporters were a basket of deplorables. It's -- she said they were irredeemable. They were not American. I mean, it's extraordinary. And then she labeled one after another ""ism"" on millions of Americans who believe that we can have a stronger America at home and abroad, who believe we can get this economy moving again, who believe that we can end illegal immigration once and for all. So, Senator, this -- this insult-driven campaign, I mean that's small potatoes compared to Hillary Clinton, calling half of Donald Trump's supporters a basket of deplorables.Kaine, in his rebuttal, falsely claimed that Clinton retracted and apologized for calling Trump supporters ""deplorables.""""Hillary Clinton said something on the campaign trail, and the very next day, she said, you know what: I shouldn't have said that,"" Kaine claimed.Pence quickly corrected him: ""He said she shouldn't have said half.""Then, after Kaine commenced rattling off a series of progressive complaints with Trump, the Virginia Senator shifted the conversation back to immigration by attacking Trump's reform plan.""Donald Trump proposes to deport 16 million people, 11 million who are here without documents,"" Kaine said. He continued:And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to get rid of birthright citizenship. So if you're born here, but your parents don't have documents, they want to eliminate that. That's another 4.5 million people. These guys -- and Donald Trump have said it -- deportation force. They want to go house to house, school to school, business to business, and kick out 16 million people.""That's nonsense. That's nonsense,"" Pence corrected Kaine again.""I cannot believe that Governor Pence would sit here and defend his running mate's claim that we should create a deportation force to -- so that they'll all be gone,"" Kaine trudged on.""Senator, we have a deportation force. It's called Immigrations and Customs Enforcement,"" Pence explained to Kaine. ""And the union for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement for the first time in their history endorsed Donald Trump to be the next President of the United States of America.""After Pence further explained Trump's common sense immigration reform plan, he delivered yet another zinger against Kaine.""Senator, I'll work with you when you go back to the Senate, I promise you. We'll work with you to reform the immigration system,"" Pence told Kaine, an implicit dig at him since the only way he goes back to the Senate is if he and Clinton lose in November.Kaine was clunky in his reply again, playing into Pence's game once more. ""I look forward to working together in whatever capacities we serve in,"" Kaine said. Later, on cybersecurity, Pence landed the jab on Kaine again. ""I look forward if I'm privileged to be in this role of working with you in the Senate to make sure that we resource that effort,"" Pence said about the cybersecurity issue.""We will work together in whatever roles we inhabit,"" Kaine shot back.
I mean, I'm very proud of the fact that -- I come from a state that works. The state of Indiana has balanced budgets. We cut taxes, we've made record investments in education and in infrastructure, and I still finish my term with $2 billion in the bank. That's a little bit different than when Senator Kaine was governor here in Virginia. He actually -- he actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion. He left his state about $2 billion in the hole. In the state of Indiana, we've cut unemployment in half; unemployment doubled when he was governor. 
But I think he's a very fitting running mate for Hillary Clinton because in the wake of a season where American families are struggling in this economy under the weight of higher taxes and Obamacare and the war on coal and the stifling avalanche of regulation coming out of this administration, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same. It really is remarkable that they actually are advocating a trillion dollars in tax increases, which I get that. You tried to raise taxes here in Virginia and were unsuccessful. But a trillion dollars in tax increases, more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan. But Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare. They want to expand it into a single-payer program. And for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start. 
Look, Donald Trump and I have a plan to get this economy moving again just the way that it worked in the 1980s, just the way it worked in the 1960s, and that is by lowering taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms, ending the war on coal that is hurting jobs and hurting this economy even here in Virginia, repealing Obamacare lock, stock, and barrel, and repealing all of the executive orders that Barack Obama has signed that are stifling economic growth in this economy. We can get America moving again. Put on top of that the kind of trade deals that'll put the American worker first, and you've got a prescription for real growth. And when you get the economy growing, Elaine, that's when you can deal with the national debt. When we get back to 3.5 percent to 4 percent growth, which Donald Trump's plan will do, then we're going to have the resources to meet our nation's needs at home and abroad, and we're going to have the ability to bring down the national debt.

Police officers are the best of us. And the men and women, white, African American, Asian, Latino, Hispanic, they put their lives on the line every single day. And let me say, at the risk of agreeing with you, community policing is a great idea. It's worked in the Hoosier state. And we fully support that.
Donald Trump and I are going to make sure that law enforcement have the resources and the tools to be able to really restore law and order to the cities and communities in this nation. It's probably -- probably why the 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Donald Trump as the next President of the United States of America, because they see his commitment to them. They see his commitment to law and order.
But they also -- they also hear the bad-mouthing, the bad-mouthing that comes from people that seize upon tragedy in the wake of police action shootings as -- as a reason to -- to use a broad brush to accuse law enforcement of -- of implicit bias or institutional racism. And that really has got to stop.
I mean, when an African American police officer in Charlotte named Brentley Vinson, an all-star football player who went to Liberty University here in the state, came home, followed his dad into law enforcement, joined the force in Charlotte, joined the force in Charlotte in 2014, was involved in a police action shooting that claimed the life of Keith -- Keith Lamont Scott, it was a tragedy. I mean, I -- we -- we mourn with those who mourn. We -- we grieve with those who grieve. And we're saddened at the loss of life.
But Hillary Clinton actually referred to that moment as an example of implicit bias in the police force, where -- where she used -- when she was asked in the debate a week ago whether there was implicit bias in law enforcement, her only answer was that there's implicit bias in everyone in the United States.

Donald Trump's laid out a plan to end illegal immigration once and for all in this country. We've been talking it to death for 20 years. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to continue the policies of open borders, amnesty, catch and release, sanctuary cities, all the things that are driving -- that are driving wages down in this country, Senator, and also too often with criminal aliens in the country, it's bringing heartbreak.
But I -- Donald Trump has a plan that he laid out in Arizona, that will deal systemically with illegal immigration, beginning with border security, internal enforcement. It's probably why for the first time in the history of Immigration and Customs Enforcement their union actually endorsed Donald Trump as the next President of the United States because they know they need help to enforce the laws of this country.
And Donald Trump has laid out a priority to remove criminal aliens, remove people that have overstayed their visas. And -- and once we have accomplished all of that, which will -- which will strengthen our economy, strengthen the rule of law in the country and make our communities safer once the criminal aliens are out, then we'll deal with those that remain.
But I have to tell you, I just -- I was listening to the avalanche of insults coming out of Senator Kaine a minute ago.

I mean, to be honest with you, if Donald Trump had said all of the things that you've said he said in the way you said he said them, he still wouldn't have a fraction of the insults that Hillary Clinton leveled when she said that half of our supporters were a basket of deplorables. It's -- she said they were irredeemable. They were not American. I mean, it's extraordinary. And then she labeled one after another ""ism"" on millions of Americans who believe that we can have a stronger America at home and abroad, who believe we can get this economy moving again, who believe that we can end illegal immigration once and for all. So, Senator, this -- this insult-driven campaign, I mean that's small potatoes compared to Hillary Clinton, calling half of Donald Trump's supporters a basket of deplorables.

And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to get rid of birthright citizenship. So if you're born here, but your parents don't have documents, they want to eliminate that. That's another 4.5 million people. These guys -- and Donald Trump have said it -- deportation force. They want to go house to house, school to school, business to business, and kick out 16 million people.
SIGN UP""Gov. Pence was flawless,"" Jason Miller, the senior communications adviser to Pence's running mate Donald J. Trump, told Breitbart News. ""Tonight showed the strength of the Trump-Pence ticket and that our ideas are better for America. And ultimately, it showed the good judgment Donald Trump has in selecting such a strong number two in Gov. Pence.""Pence's win came on a night where the Democratic presidential ticket of Hillary Rodham Clinton and Kaine were set back significantly after a smooth past week since the first of three Trump-Clinton debates at Hofstra University last Monday. Trump, under fire from Clinton and her allies in the legacy establishment media since the last debate, has clawed his way back from the brink yet again with a series of successful rallies during the weekend, culminating with a major pair of appearances in Colorado on Monday evening. But it was Pence's performance at the vice presidential debate, moderated by CBS News' Elaine Quijano, that has put new spring in the Trump camp's step heading into the next all-important debate on Sunday evening in St. Louis.Pence took command of the stage from the outset. After both Kaine and Pence gave satisfactory answers to a fundamental question about readiness for the presidential job should that need ever arise, the first real question of the debate to Kaine from Quijano set the tone off the bat.""Senator Kaine, on the campaign trail, you praised Secretary Clinton's character, including her commitment to public service, yet 60 percent of voters don't think she's trustworthy. Why do so many people distrust her? Is it because they have questions about her emails and the Clinton Foundation?"" Quijano asked Kaine.In his answer, Kaine refused to defend Clinton at all on the Clinton Foundation--the source of controversy for perhaps the Clinton political dynasty's biggest scandals, the Clinton Cash narrative--and wouldn't defend her use of a private email server either.Instead, when trying to explain why he trusts Clinton when so many Americans do not, he quickly pivoted the answer into an attack on Donald Trump instead--without giving any substantial evidence for why anyone should trust his running mate. When Pence got a similar question as a follow-up, he seized the moment to frame Kaine and Clinton as simply hurlers of insults running a policy-free campaign.""Let me say first and foremost that, Senator, you and Hillary Clinton would know a lot about an insult-driven campaign,"" Pence said, calmly and coolly, directly challenging Kaine. ""It really is remarkable.""As Pence proceeded to detail the many failures of Hillary Clinton's time in government, Kaine interrupted him many times with what seemed to be petty interjections. All told, all evening, Kaine would interrupt Pence or the moderator Quijano scores of times--70 in some counts.As Kaine unsuccessfully attempted to steal the momentum from Pence, the Indiana Governor joked playfully, ""I must have hit a nerve here."" Kaine would spend the next minute or so continually trying to talk over Pence and failing, as Quijano eventually cut him off and told him he would eventually get a chance to respond.At one point in this early exchange, in one of his many interruptions, Kaine declared it was his turn to talk. ""Okay, now I can weigh in,"" Kaine said, before Quijano held him back again: ""Senator, you have an opportunity to respond.""When he finally got a word in, Kaine claimed all was rosy on planet earth--claiming the status quo as his and Clinton's campaign mantlepiece. ""Governor Pence -- Governor Pence doesn't think the world's going so well, and he, you know, is going to say it's everybody's fault,"" Kaine implored, to which Pence simply retorted, ""Do you?""Kaine then tried to take credit--on Clinton's behalf--for killing Osama bin Laden, the 9/11 mastermind and al-Qaeda leader, even though she was not responsible for taking down bin Laden.""Let me tell you this: When Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, Governor Pence, did you know that Osama bin Laden was alive?"" Kaine said.""Yes,"" Pence replied.After that rocky start, Kaine never recovered--and Pence toyed with him all night while speaking directly into the cameras for the millions at home watching to hear his policy-focused agenda. When the conversation turned to the economy, Pence delivered perhaps his best lines of the night--where he clearly laid out the success of his conservative economic policies as Indiana's governor while subtly, but pointedly, undermining Kaine's weaknesses from his time as Virginia's governor.""I think the fact that -- that under this past administration of which Hillary Clinton was a part, we've almost doubled the national debt is atrocious,"" Pence said. He added:I mean, I'm very proud of the fact that -- I come from a state that works. The state of Indiana has balanced budgets. We cut taxes, we've made record investments in education and in infrastructure, and I still finish my term with $2 billion in the bank. That's a little bit different than when Senator Kaine was governor here in Virginia. He actually -- he actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion. He left his state about $2 billion in the hole. In the state of Indiana, we've cut unemployment in half; unemployment doubled when he was governor. But I think he's a very fitting running mate for Hillary Clinton because in the wake of a season where American families are struggling in this economy under the weight of higher taxes and Obamacare and the war on coal and the stifling avalanche of regulation coming out of this administration, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same. It really is remarkable that they actually are advocating a trillion dollars in tax increases, which I get that. You tried to raise taxes here in Virginia and were unsuccessful. But a trillion dollars in tax increases, more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan. But Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare. They want to expand it into a single-payer program. And for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start. Look, Donald Trump and I have a plan to get this economy moving again just the way that it worked in the 1980s, just the way it worked in the 1960s, and that is by lowering taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms, ending the war on coal that is hurting jobs and hurting this economy even here in Virginia, repealing Obamacare lock, stock, and barrel, and repealing all of the executive orders that Barack Obama has signed that are stifling economic growth in this economy. We can get America moving again. Put on top of that the kind of trade deals that'll put the American worker first, and you've got a prescription for real growth. And when you get the economy growing, Elaine, that's when you can deal with the national debt. When we get back to 3.5 percent to 4 percent growth, which Donald Trump's plan will do, then we're going to have the resources to meet our nation's needs at home and abroad, and we're going to have the ability to bring down the national debt.In his answer, Kaine started with a canned catch line that did not go over well.""On the economy, there's a fundamental choice for the American electorate,"" Kaine said. ""Do you want a 'you're hired' president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a 'you're fired' president in Donald Trump? I think that's not such a hard choice.""From there, Kaine struggled to detail his and Clinton's economic plans--then admitted that there's tax hikes in them--before spending the rest of, and the majority of in total, his answer attacking Trump, rather than telling the audience about their own plans.Whenever Kaine or Quijano tried to shift the conversation back to Trump's tax returns, as they often did throughout the night, Pence handled them with ease.""Well, this is probably the difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine. And, I mean, Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine -- God bless you for it, career public servants, that's great -- Donald Trump is a businessman, not a career politician. He actually built a business,"" Pence said when Quijano pressed him on the matter for the second time, specifically about Trump's illegally obtained tax documents from 1995 that The New York Times had published during the weekend. ""Those tax returns that ... came out publicly this week show that he faced some pretty tough times 20 years ago. But like virtually every other business, including The New York Times not too long ago, he used what's called net operating loss. We have a tax code, Senator, that actually is designed to encourage entrepreneurship in this country.""After more back and forth on the taxes--during which Pence swatted away attack after attack-- and a brief exchange on Social Security, Quijano moved the conversation to the issue of community-police relations. Pence hit another home run.""You know, my uncle was a cop, a career cop, on the beat in downtown Chicago. He was my hero when I was growing up. And we'd go up to visit my dad's family in Chicago. My three brothers and I would marvel at my uncle when he would come out in his uniform, sidearm at his side,"" he said, before broadly defending police officers:Police officers are the best of us. And the men and women, white, African American, Asian, Latino, Hispanic, they put their lives on the line every single day. And let me say, at the risk of agreeing with you, community policing is a great idea. It's worked in the Hoosier state. And we fully support that.Donald Trump and I are going to make sure that law enforcement have the resources and the tools to be able to really restore law and order to the cities and communities in this nation.

We've been talking it to death for 20 years. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to continue the policies of open borders, amnesty, catch and release, sanctuary cities, all the things that are driving -- that are driving wages down in this country, Senator, and also too often with criminal aliens in the country, it's bringing heartbreak.But I -- Donald Trump has a plan that he laid out in Arizona, that will deal systemically with illegal immigration, beginning with border security, internal enforcement.

Mike Pence of Indiana topped Democratic candidate Sen. Tim Kaine (VA). Some 29 percent said they moved toward voting for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump after the exchange.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERDespite the Democrat-heavy audience displayed in the new poll, 48 percent said Pence won the debate over Kaine. Only 42 percent of those debate watchers said Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's running mate won.Two-fifths of those registered voters surveyed said they were Democrats, 30 percent Republican and 29 percent unaffiliated or part of another party.Almost 30 percent of respondents said they were more likely to vote for Trump after watching the debate, while just 18 percent said they moved toward Clinton. An original image broadcast by CNN of the numbers of debate watchers that moved toward voting for Clinton or Trump after watching the vice presidential candidates were reversed, showing more moving toward Clinton; however, a CNN reporter corrected the numbers after they had been posted to the screen and revealed that the true result. More than half of debate watchers surveyed said ""neither"" when asked who the debate made them likely to vote for.Kaine was agressive in the exchange, and it may have cost him. He jumped from 28 percent ""unfavorable"" before the debate to 40 percent after. While 16 percent of those asked weren't sure if they saw Kaine as favorable or unfavorable before the debate, only 4 percent were unsure after.Some 43 percent of respondents said Kaine did worse than expected compared to 38 percent that he did better and 15 that said he did the same as expected.Pence was seen as doing better than expected by two-thirds of those polled while only 14 percent said worse and 15 percent said he performed the same as expected.It wasn't clear just by what margin the poll leaned Democrat, but 58 percent said they thought Kaine better defended Clinton while 35 percent said Pence defended Trump better. 48 percent said that Kaine had a better understanding of issues while 41 percent said Pence was the candidate that better understands issues.Kaine was seen by 76 percent as more on the attack of Pence while just 14 percent said Pence attacked Kaine more.Even greater numbers of respondents found Pence likable than said he won the debate. 53 percent said Pence was more likable while only 37 percent said Kaine was.Pence's favorability jumped seven points after the debate. 57 percent of survey respondents said that had a favorable opinion after the debate compared to 50 percent favorable before. His unfavorable rating also increased a small amount, from 36 percent to 40. Those unsure dropped from 15 percent before the debate to 3 percent after.Pence was seen as more broadly qualified to take over as president if needed according to CNN. 77 percent said Pence was qualified compared to 70 percent that said Kaine was.The poll had a sampling error of +/- 4.5 percent according to CNN broadcast reporting on the poll.CNN reported its polling methodology:The CNN/ORC post-debate poll includes interviews with 472 registered voters who watched the October 4 vice presidential debate.

It argues that Sikh and South Asian students are also targeted, mistakenly, by anti-Muslim bullying because of the way students may dress or look.There is nothing in the bill about bullying of Christian or Jewish students, whether by Muslims or other students.Anti-Jewish rhetoric and antisemitic attacks are a serious problem at several universities in California. A recent study found that of the top ten most antisemitic campuses in the U.S., six were in California, and five were from the University of California system. Though the bill only covers elementary and secondary schools, habits and prejudices formed -- or ignored -- during those years arguably form students' attitudes and opinions before they reach tertiary educational institutions.State Sen. Joel Anderson (R-Alpine) opposed the bill, telling the San Diego Union-Tribune: ""Religious bullying of any faith is wrong, and I would have supported a bill that was inclusive of all faiths.""Joel B.

Hillary, on the contrary, ""has struggled to connect with the public personally and to talk about her own faith,"" Sweas delicately observes.""The Catholic vote is going to be absolutely critical to our success,"" Kaine said recently, encouraging volunteers to rally their fellow Catholic around the Clinton campaign.Though hardly a monolithic bloc, Catholics account for more than 50 million potential American voters, and the ""Catholic vote"" is important to anyone hoping to set up shop in the White House.But Kaine's alleged asset is also his Achilles heel. While he professes to being a ""devout"" Catholic, in point of fact he publicly flouts central Catholic teaching--notably on abortion--which has earned him nothing but scorn from conservative Catholics who are staunchly pro-life.In her article, Sweas noted that Kaine has ""a 100 percent pro-choice voting record for his time in the Senate from both NARAL and Planned Parenthood,"" which has led many critics to call him a ""hypocrite.""While Kaine offers lip service to being ""personally opposed"" to abortion (a la Mario Cuomo), his words ring hollow to those who understand abortion to be a social evil that destroys the most vulnerable members of society.Being personally opposed to abortion is like being personally opposed to racism or wife-beating. You can't just ""opt out"" while supporting other people's right to do harm. As one writer noted, ""Don't like abortion? Don't have one!"" is as silly as saying, ""Don't like rape? Don't rape anyone!""In Tuesday's debate, Kaine trotted out his Catholic faith once again, but when challenged about conflicts between his faith and his voting record, Kaine deflected the question, saying that he doesn't think that ""the doctrines of any one religion should be mandated for everyone,"" as if the protection of innocent life were merely a quibble of doctrine.As Saint John Paul II wrote in 1995, the legal toleration of abortion ""can in no way claim to be based on respect for the conscience of others, precisely because society has the right and the duty to protect itself against the abuses which can occur in the name of conscience and under the pretext of freedom.""Considering this is an election year, the U.S. Catholic bishops have been unusually vocal in their criticism of Tim Kaine's claims to being a faithful Catholic, citing his open dissent from essential moral teachings of the Church.In a Facebook post titled ""VP Pick, Tim Kaine, a Catholic?"" Bishop Thomas J. Tobin of Providence noted that Kaine ""has been widely identified as a Roman Catholic"" while at the same time ""he publicly supports 'freedom of choice' for abortion, same-sex marriage, gay adoptions, and the ordination of women as priests.""""All of these positions are clearly contrary to well-established Catholic teachings; all of them have been opposed by Pope Francis as well,"" Tobin wrote.""Senator Kaine has said, 'My faith is central to everything I do.' But apparently, and unfortunately, his faith isn't central to his public, political life,"" Bishop Tobin concluded.In a column in his diocesan newspaper, Philadelphia Archbishop Charles J. Chaput also took issue with Kaine for his open dissent from Catholic teaching, while bringing in sitting Vice President, Joe Biden as well.These two ""prominent Catholics,"" the Archbishop said, ""both seem to publicly ignore or invent the content of their Catholic faith as they go along.""Anyone who claims the Catholic label while not actually believing what the Catholic faith holds to be true and letting it guide their thoughts and actions ""is simply fooling himself or herself -- and even more importantly, misleading others,"" he added.Come November, Tim Kaine may regret playing fast and loose with the religion card.

The storm appears to have more than enough power to veer right to hammer Georgia and the Carolinas, then move north, bringing torrential rain and flooding to the East Coast.Jason Rasgon, associate professor of entomology and disease epidemiology at Penn State University, warned AccuWeather that Zika mosquitoes are so light and unaffected by raindrops, they will be picked up and blown to a new area as the Matthew advances.There is no vaccine or treatment for the Zika virus, making prevention essential. Early on in the American Zika outbreak, public health officials falsely believed that Zika virus transmissions would remain limited to individuals that became infected through travel outside the continental U.S. to places where Zika is common, like Brazil and Puerto Rico.But with two new locally-infected Zika cases being reported in Miami Beach and another four more in Miami-Dade County, the potential Zika pandemic now has confirmed 139 cases caused by domestic transmission. The CDC reports that there are confirmed 718 travel-related Zika infections recorded in Florida, with 103 involving pregnant women.Zika is symptomatic for only 18 percent of cases. If symptoms appear, they are usually associated with a mild flu fever, joint pain, muscle pain, headache and red eyes. Consequently, the Zika infection rate is drastically underreported.""Vector borne diseases"" such as dengue fever, malaria, yellow fever, and Zika infect over one billion people and kill over one million people per year. Zika is easily spread by 1) mosquito blood bite; 2) mother-to-child; 3) sex; 4) saliva; 5) urine; 6) blood transfusion; and 7) research laboratory exposure, according to the CDC.For the first time in its 70 year history, the CDC warned Americans on August 1 not to travel to an American neighborhood for fear of catching an infectious disease. The CDC advised pregnant women and their partners not to travel to a Zika-infested community near Miami that had 14 cases in a neighborhood with 200 homes and businesses.According to the World Health Organization's ""Zika Virus Microcephaly"" Situation Report, dated September 29, there are now confirmed Zika cases in over 70 countries. Indigenous domestic strains are now native to South America, North America and Asia.The United States Center for Disease Control and Florida Homeland Security officials have gone all-out since August 4 with aerial and ground spraying in the Miami-Dade County ""Danger Zone"" to kill the common Aedes aegypti mosquitos that carry Zika virus.CDC Director Tom Frieden told reporters that Miami-Dade's aerial spraying of the insecticide Naled -- in a fine mist fired from planes about 100 feet off the ground -- was found to kill more than 90 percent of mosquitos in the 10-mile square area in Miami's Wynwood area, where the first U.S. locally-transmitted Zika cases were found.Hurricane Matthew will force an aerial pesticide spraying halt in South Florida on October 4, because it is ineffective in heavy winds. The storm's up to 25 inches of rain are expected to cause widespread flooding that will drastically increase mosquito breeding.Florida Gov. Rick Scott has desperately warned residents and business owners to drain standing water from their properties before and after the hurricane to limit mosquito population growth. SIGN UP"

How do I know? It's bankrupting everyone in middle class America -- including me.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERDonald Trump wants to repeal Obamacare. Hillary Clinton wants to expand it. The choice doesn't get any clearer than that.Knowing this, it's pretty clear anyone who supports Obamacare, supports Hillary. Anyone who despises Obamacare and agrees it's a disaster is automatically supporting Trump. That's pretty clear, right?Better ask Bill Clinton. Because Bill just admitted conservatives like me have been right about Obamacare all along.So is Bill Clinton trying to tell us something? Is Bill Clinton rooting for Donald Trump?First a little education about the conservative position on Obamacare. Here is what I've screamed from the highest mountains for the past eight years in thousands of commentaries, media appearances and four books- including right here at Breitbart:Just to reinforce, here's a personal story. It's hard evidence of what's happening to every small business owner and independent contractor in America. Because of Obamacare my health insurance premium went from $500 per month to more than $1,700. For all you Obama and Hillary fans who took math at a public school, that's well over TRIPLE the cost.But that's only part of the story. My co-pays tripled. My deductible doubled. My prescriptions are barely covered. Eye doctor visits are no longer covered. Dental visits are no longer covered.Wait, it gets worse. And for $1,700 per month, my insurance no longer covers anything. It won't pay a bill. It's a disgrace. It's a tragedy. It's a disaster. It's Obamacare.Everywhere I go, the people I meet have the same exact story. Maybe that's because most of my friends, fans and the people I do business with are all in the same boat. We're the forgotten. We're the left behind. We're the only group left in America who can be discriminated against...who can be freely and openly persecuted.We're ""The Deplorables.""We are white, straight, Christian and male. And we are screwed. Democrats hate us. Democrats want to cripple our finances. Democrats want to silence us. Democrats want to take away our jobs. Democrats want to redistribute our money.By the way, Pew Research reports the middle class is 75 to 79 percent white. CNBC reports that small business owners are 85 percent white. These facts and many more about the attack on middle class America can be found in my new book, ""ANGRY WHITE MALE.""Obamacare was the Trojan Horse Obama, Hillary and their socialist cabal used to destroy us. This is no coincidence. This is no mistake. This is a purposeful plan to destroy the middle class and small business. To make us dependent on government. To bleed us dry. To reward Obama's favorite groups- the poor, specifically those who have been (in his liberal mind) ""discriminated against."" This is all about creating equality and social justice.Until now, not one Democrat politician anywhere in America was willing to admit what is going on. But that all changed last week.Who now agrees with me that Obamacare is a disaster? Former President Bill Clinton. You know, the guy married to Hillary.Bill Clinton announced it publicly days ago in a speech in Michigan. Bill summed up everything I've been saying and writing for eight long, lonely years. I guess he's been reading my books. Here are Bill's words:You've got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care, and then the people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half and it's the craziest thing in the world.On the other hand, the current system works fine if you're eligible for Medicaid, if you're a lower-income working person. If you're already on Medicare or if you get enough subsidies on a modest income that you can afford your health care.But the people getting killed in this deal are the small-business people and individuals who make just a little bit too much to get any of these subsidies.That sounded like it came straight from my book ""ANGRY WHITE MALE."" I couldn't have said it better myself.Bill Clinton just validated and vindicated all the conservative critics of Obamacare. He just admitted everything I ever said about Obamacare was and is correct.Now keep in mind Hillary thinks Obamacare is fantastic. She thinks it's working just fine, with a few little tweaks. She thinks it should be dramatically expanded. She wants to raise taxes even higher. She wants more regulations. And she thinks the economy is hunky dory and we are on the verge of a great economic expansion.Which brings up two very important questions...Do Bill and his wife even speak to each other?And...who is Bill Clinton campaigning for?I feel your pain Bill. It's almost as if he's a POW blinking his eyes in Morse Code. He's trying to tell us all something.Thank you Bill for admitting what is happening. Even Hillary's husband admits Obamacare is a disaster. Even Hillary's husband knows the middle class is the target. Even Hillary's husband knows the predominately white middle class of America is getting screwed. Obamacare was the Trojan Horse. Obamacare was about bleeding us dry from the very beginning.Next up...Can we get Bill to admit he's rooting for Donald Trump? I'll start working on it.You've got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care, and then the people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half and it's the craziest thing in the world.
On the other hand, the current system works fine if you're eligible for Medicaid, if you're a lower-income working person. If you're already on Medicare or if you get enough subsidies on a modest income that you can afford your health care.
But the people getting killed in this deal are the small-business people and individuals who make just a little bit too much to get any of these subsidies.SIGN UP"

Trump has since softened that stance somewhat, and now wants to keep people out from terror-prone countries. But regardless, the constitutional protection against religious discrimination does not apply to people who are not yet immigrants, residents or citizens.In fact, our current immigration policy ""discriminates"" against Muslims because it does not permit people to bring over their spouses from polygamous marriages, which are permitted in many Muslim countries. That kind of discrimination is constitutional and lawful.It would, arguably, be appropriate for the U.S. to discriminate in favor of some religions -- such as Christians and Yazidis -- who are subject to discrimination and persecution in the Muslim world.Regardless, it would be constitutional to do so.BREITBART LIVE"

She then spent several minutes slamming Wells Fargo Bank, hedge fund companies, and Wall Street investors.""We're tired of the cowboy culture on Wall Street that wrecked the economy and we're not going to let it happen again,"" she yelled to those assembled at Harrisburg's Zembo Shrine (also known as the Zembo Mosque).She called for tougher regulations on the investment and banking sectors.Clinton did not mention the hundreds of thousands she made in speeches given to the very firms and banks she spent time attacking.But that only served as a basis to again regurgitate the claim that Donald trump was happy when Americans were losing their homes during the housing crash.""One of the biggest contributors to what happened was the housing crisis, remember?"" she said to her supporters. She continued saying, ""Donald Trump rooted, he rooted for a housing collapse.""Then, in an attempt to take one of Donald Trump's key issues, Hillary went on to propose that companies planning to move headquarters or manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. should be forced to pay back ""every"" tax break they've ""ever gotten"" before being allowed to move.""And you know I'm tired of American companies shipping jobs overseas,"" she told the crowd. ""So, we're going to make them give back any tax breaks they've ever gotten. If they wanna move jobs out of America they're gonna have to pay an exit tax.""The Democrat next attacked Trump over his reluctance to release his tax returns.Hillary insinuated that Trump somehow broke the law with the tax payments he purportedly made as highlighted by a recent report in The New York Times and insisted she would end the tax rules that she claimed only the rich can take advantage of.To the applause of the crowd, Clinton claimed that when she becomes president she would pass a law to force all presidential candidates to reveal their taxes before being allowed to run for the highest office in the land.As usual, Clinton again threw out the everlasting Democrat plan to ""raise taxes on the rich.""Hillary also did not mention to her audience that she used the same tax dodging trick critics say Donald Trump did in the 1990s.Hillary went on to ridicule Trump as being unfit for the presidency.At the rally Clinton echoed comments made at an earlier event the same day where she told a townhall-style event that Trump needs to be ""laughed at.""In response to a 15-year-old's question on Trump's alleged insults toward women, Clinton replied, ""We need to laugh at it. We need to refute it. We need to ignore it. We need to stand up to it."" It was later discovered by Breitbart News that the girl's question had been written for her by her progressive state senator father.Clinton also attacked the Second Amendment and claimed guns are the reason the nation's inner cities are so filled with violence.""We have got to have a counter-movement to this reckless, irresponsible propaganda that's pushing guns everywhere to everyone,"" she said. ""The time has come for us to act. The deaths and the injuries and the losses are so great.""Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.SIGN UP"

And we learned that, through that painful situation, that gaps in the background record system should have been closed and that could have prevented that crime. So we're going work to do things like close background record checks and if we do, we won't have the tragedies that we did.An ambiguous point in Kaine's statement needs to be clarified and an inaccuracy needs to be addressed.The ambiguity that needs clarification is the fact that the Virginia Tech gunman passed a background check for his gun-background checks were in place and the gunman submitted to one to get the firearm he used to kill innocents in the Virginia Tech gun-free zone. The inaccuracy that needs to be corrected is Kaine's intimation that there are loopholes in the background check system that need to be closed in order to prevent ""tragedies"" from occurring.In truth, the background check system is one that looks back-thus the name ""background"" check. If the person buying the gun has no criminal or mental health record in his or her past then there is nothing to trigger a rejection during the background check process. In other words, background checks do not stop latent criminals, only actual ones. To pretend otherwise is to suggest that loopholes can be shut to make background checks predictors of future behavior, thereby ending the possibility of heinous crimes like that which occurred at Virginia Tech. This is not possible, but it does make great fodder for Democrats who peddle more gun control for law-abiding citizens under the false premise of making Americans safe.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

At that same time, a customer with a concealed carry permit pulled into the parking lot and saw the attempted robbery taking place. The customer ""pulled his gun and went inside the store,"" where he ordered to suspects to ""drop their weapons"" and get on the ground.The suspects complied, and the customer kept his gun on them until sheriff's deputies arrived on scene. The deputies ""commended the customer for his actions"" but made clear they do not recommend others take the same approach. They fear it could lead to a ""shootout and someone getting hurt.""The Houston Chronicle reports the three suspects allegedly ""held store employees at gunpoint"" prior to the good Samaritan's intervention. It would be interesting to hear the employees' opinion on the value of a good guy with a gun.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
