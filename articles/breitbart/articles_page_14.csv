""The election of Donald Trump has emboldened the forces of hate and bigotry in America."" Reid's comments come as anti-Trump riots have broken out across the nation and as other leading Democrats including President Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have called for unity.Reid claims that white nationalists, Vladimir Putin, and ISIS are celebrating Trump's win while many Americans are afraid.White nationalists, Vladimir Putin and ISIS are celebrating Donald Trump's victory, while innocent, law-abiding Americans are wracked with fear - especially African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Muslim Americans, LGBT Americans and Asian Americans. Watching white nationalists celebrate while innocent Americans cry tears of fear does not feel like America.In the statement Reid lists segments of America that are ""fearful"" after Donald Trump's victory on Tuesday.I have heard more stories in the past 48 hours of Americans living in fear of their own government and their fellow Americans than I can remember hearing in five decades in politics. Hispanic Americans who fear their families will be torn apart, African Americans being heckled on the street, Muslim Americans afraid to wear a headscarf, gay and lesbian couples having slurs hurled at them and feeling afraid to walk down the street holding hands. American children waking up in the middle of the night crying, terrified that Trump will take their parents away. Young girls unable to understand why a man who brags about sexually assaulting women has been elected president.Reid finishes by setting his criteria for ""healing"" the divided nation by calling Donald Trump a ""sexual predator"" who ""fueled his campaign with bigotry and hate.""If Trump wants to roll back the tide of hate he unleashed, he has a tremendous amount of work to do and he must begin immediately.Reid is serving out his final months before retiring from his role as Senate Minority Leader and as Senator from Nevada in January.Dustin Stockton is a political reporter for Breitbart News, a community liaison for Gun Owners of America, and a political strategist.

In a campaign marred by constant revelations of criminal activity by the candidate, repeated federal investigations, and a tough loss, Abedin herself also experienced constant personal crisis.At the end of October, news broke that Huma's husband, disgraced former New York Congressman Anthony Weiner, came under scrutiny for yet another illicit sexual relationship. But this time, Weiner, with whom Abedin has a child, was accused of sexually exploiting a minor. It was not long before authorities announced that charges would be filed against the former congressman.Then, just prior to the election, it was revealed that the FBI had found an additional cache of upwards to 650,000 new Hillary Clinton emails on the various electronic devices owned jointly by Abedin and Weiner. The discovery caused the FBI to re-open the investigation into Clinton's illicit emails only 11 days before Election Day, casting new light on Abedin and her role in the scandal.Worse for the long-time political aide, a dark cloud is still hanging over her life not only with the FBI investigation into her husband's sexual misconduct, but the ongoing investigation into her own actions connected with Clinton's illicit secret email server used during her tenure as Obama's secretary of state.By many accounts, Abedin lied to the FBI during a previous investigation into Clinton's violation of America's national security laws.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.SIGN UP

It's just you. There is no equivalent urge to large-scale political violence on the Right.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERLet's get the nomenclature out of the way right up front: they're not ""Trump riots."" They're Clinton/Obama riots. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama could shut a great deal of the violence down by speaking out against it, with passion and without qualifications. Neither of them has done so, as of Friday.The media could help by demanding Clinton and Obama speak up, but aren't. They could punish both of them for indulging the rioters by staging Special Reports with dramatic music - America Under Siege, Day 3 - and hounding every Democrat official who passes before their cameras. You know damn well they would do both of those things, if these were Trump supporters misbehaving - or even peaceably demonstrating - after a Clinton victory.You also know there would be no significant effort to understand the rioters and their ""grievances"" if they were people of the Right. Celebrities would not be playing along by sharing their own feelings of frustrated rage. Major media outlets would not be pretending the riots were merely ""protests"" or ""demonstrations"" until the local police pointed at the burning wreckage and told them to knock it off.No, in that mirror universe where Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election, there would be absolutely zero tolerance for anyone who refused to instantly and completely accept the legitimacy of her election. Everything Donald Trump ever said about ""rigged elections"" and voter fraud would be playing on an endless loop. Those injured or vandalized by violent street theater would become national celebrities.But we know none of that would actually happen in the mirror universe, because the American Right doesn't hold violent demonstrations, much less outright riots. We know what right-wing demonstrations look like in modern America: Tea Party rallies that clean up their own garbage, haunted by a few creepy Democrat activists trying to stage false-flag incidents of violence or racism. The media has been resolutely ignoring titanic March for Life rallies in Washington D.C. for decades. They get away with it because the pro-lifers are resolutely well-behaved.Left-wingers own political violence for a number of reasons. One of the big ones is that left-wing media excuses it, and indulges Democratic political leaders who excuse it. The odious Senator Harry Reid (D-NV), for example, is currently trying to pin the riots on Trump, ""a sexual predator who lost the popular vote and fueled his campaign with bigotry and hate,"" while arguing that the fears of hyperventilating liberals is ""entirely rational, because Donald Trump has talked openly about doing terrible things to them.""This would not be tolerated for one single second by the media class if a Republican said it to excuse riots against the election of President Hillary Clinton. Reid would be chased off the national stage by a horde of shrieking reporters. And since he's the retiring former Majority Leader of the Senate, his entire party would be forced to renounce him in a series of Sunday-show Inquisitions.Another reason is that liberals seek total personal and spiritual fulfillment in politics. It is, for all intents and purposes, their religion. They think political positions are the only meaningful measure of personal character. Who cares if you drowned a girl in your car, and spent your life perpetrating one documented instance of degrading lechery after another, if you were good on ""women's issues?"" So what if you abused an intern for sex and assaulted a few women, if you did your bit to keep the abortion mills churning?  No big deal if you cruise out of office with Americans shedding blood on battlefields across the Middle East, as long as you came into office really hating that unilateralist warmongering cowboy Bush!The unseemly emotional meltdowns so many liberals are proudly posting online after the election - may of them using their own children as props - testify to how deeply liberals confuse personal identity with political posturing. They also believe in passion as a political force, which is one reason they work so hard to strip their political opponents of passionate arguments. Everything people who aren't liberals get excited about is pre-emptively nuked as racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, nationalism, populism... you know the devil words.The Left is lashing out today because it just can't understand how Trump could win when they hate him SO much. They think the intensity of their opposition should give them some kind of election do-over.The Left has taken steps to render its followers childlike, and children only have two modes of expression: begging and screaming. Once upon a time, we thought universities were supposed to produce adults, but now they produce children - weaponized children accustomed to getting their way with campus protests. Tom Knighton at PJ Media chronicled some of the worst idiocies of the week: A Yale professor allowed students to skip their midterm exams to deal with election grief. The University of Kansas trotted out therapy dogs. Cornell held a cry-in. The University of Michigan gave the students Play-Doh and coloring books to work out their Trump grief.These children emerge into the adult world thinking speech codes, trigger words, and safe spaces still count for something. In other words, they think collectivist power is what matters, not individual achievement and responsibility.These aren't spontaneous riots. The Left has machinery in place to produce street theater. Money changed hands to organize these post-election freak-outs. Teachers are indulging, sanctioning, or even leading protests, complete with profane chants. Only the Left can abuse public education this way, because they've owned it for decades. The Right has no equivalent system for churning out instant protest marches, especially involving other people's children. The violent rioters are emboldened by the narrative of coast-to-coast unrest; they see themselves as the tip of the spear.One last thing to remember about left-wing political violence: the audience for such theater is primarily left-wing too. The people who finance and organize these ugly demonstrations don't necessarily think they can intimidate normal Americans into satisfying their desires. The most horrendous demonstrations are held in cities ruled by Democrats for generations, after all. Those watching from afar are mostly grinding their teeth and thinking their decision to vote for the law-and-order guy in 2016 looks pretty good right now.No, the intended audience is the Left and its organs: the mainstream media and the administrative state. These demonstrations are meant to build liberal unity, and give the organizers leverage with Democrat-dominated civic institutions. The targets of intimidation are center-left people wavering in their devotion to the Democrat Party. The masterminds behind the riots of the last few days are keenly aware that Donald Trump flipped blue states, and did very well with solidly Democratic constituencies. A little fire and broken glass might help those folks remember who they're supposed to vote for next time.Sure, there would have been some very upset people out there if Clinton had won, particularly if they thought vote fraud was involved. Some of them would have said very harsh things. But cities paralyzed by violent demonstrations, and mobs confronting riot police? For a good long while now, ""liberals,"" that's all been you. In fairly rapid succession, we had Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, and now this. Maybe it's time for you to think about why your ideology is so prone to violence.SIGN UP"

A quarter of Arizona's vote has not been counted a full day after the election because of mail-in voting, a fraud-prone practice that disserves the nation and should end.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIt's not uncommon after Election Day to have a state or two where the result is not announced for three or so days after the polls close. Out of 50 states, a couple might be within a percentage point or even a fraction of a point, requiring a detailed count of lagging absentee ballots (often from military voters overseas where it can take longer to arrive and be counted), sometimes resulting in recounts or court challenges. (Think Bush v. Gore in 2000.)But as of Wednesday night, why had Arizona not been called? Donald Trump was leading Hillary Clinton by 4.3 percent--49.6 to 45.3. Multiple states with closer margins were called for either Trump or Clinton on election night.Arizona has not, because 24 hours after the polls had closed, fully 25 percent of the vote--one quarter of all votes cast in the Grand Canyon State--had not yet been counted.That's due to mail-in voting. Roughly half of the votes cast in Arizona--1.7 million--were filled out at home and mailed in before Election Day. Arizona was finally called for President-elect Trump on Thursday, but had the margin been closer, we might not have known until the weekend.The principal newspaper in Phoenix--the liberal-leaning Arizona Republic--lamented that since the election is over, knowing who carried Arizona this late in the game is just ""academic.""The process of mail-in voting is wrought with potential for fraud and abuse. No election worker actually witnesses a voter filling out their ballot; they arrive at election collection centers as over a million faceless envelopes, with signatures and other fake-able ""verification"" measures.Mail-in voting is also fraught with potential for voter intimidation. Groups can acquire lists of people who receive mail-in ballots. Until Arizona passed a law this year, anyone--including shady leftist groups--could send a team of three or four workers to ""help"" you vote, and then collect those ballots themselves. Nothing keeps them from standing over a voter in the living room while the ballot is filled out, or (if a person is not intimidated by the observers' presence and votes for a conservative Republican despite the pressure), after the ballot is ""collected,"" it could end up in the dumpster instead of the county's election office.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that this law is unconstitutional (over eloquent dissents by conservative judges), in a case that is still ongoing and faces an uncertain fate before the current Supreme Court.Another problem with mail-in voting is that it's often done as early voting. In Arizona, there's Election Month, not Election Day. Ballots go out and citizens can often vote before they've seen two of the three presidential debates, and also before the vice presidential debate.Campaigns are conversation with the candidates, during which time the nominees make their case to the voters, debate each other, respond to criticism, and investigators--including from the media, when they bother to do their job--uncover a lifetime of foibles and missteps (of which everyone has some).All this is laid before the voters, who have time to process the information, talk with each other, ask tough follow-up questions, and weigh the answers. At the end of that conversation and vetting, an informed electorate can choose the most powerful person in the world, as well as over 8,000 other elected offices at various levels of government.Except in states like Arizona, where fully one-third of early votes are cast by mail within 96 hours of those ballots showing up in mailboxes in early October. People are voting when this examination process is nowhere near complete.Think of all that was learned about both President-elect Trump and Secretary Clinton during that last month. Think also of the news developments, like the horrific premium increases in Obamacare. Voters have a right to know all that and contemplate what these revelations mean before choosing who will lead them.This is the ""rigged system"" the president-elect denounced during the campaign. The right to cast a vote is accompanied by a right not to have your lawful ballot canceled out or diluted by an illegal, fraudulent, or corrupted ballot.While there must always be absentee procedures for people who are not able to vote on Election Day, that should be the exception, not the rule. And the law should start the process as late as possible so that voters can learn through as much of the campaign as possible before casting their ballot.Along with laws requiring voter ID and proof of citizenship (because foreigners can get drivers licenses in every state, and even illegal aliens can get them in some states), these measures can provide much-needed reforms to ensure that every citizen's lawful vote is cast and counted.Fundamental election law reform is needed to safeguard the integrity of the ballot box and ensure an informed electorate. President Trump will have an opportunity to decide if he wants to tackle that issue to clean up future elections.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

Chelsea would be the next extension of the Clinton brand. In the past few years, she has taken a very visible role in the Clinton Foundation and on the campaign trail.

I mean, the Clintons are kind of the alphas of corruption, creating a political machine, running that machine with peak efficiency, dominating our politics, excluding ordinary Americans from how they operate,"" said Schweizer.""But they're not the only ones that do that,"" he continued. ""And, of course, you have to remember, in a way, Donald Trump defeated two dynasties: the Bush dynasty in the primary, and the Clinton dynasty now. That is an amazing feat. I think it speaks to the attitude of the country that while there was this sort of veneer in the mainstream media of, oh, people kind of like dynasties, like the Kennedys and Camelot. That really wasn't the reality. People didn't like this notion of entitlements, and now it's Hillary's turn, or now it's Jeb's turn. They wanted something fundamentally different.""""And you know, Trump did it his way. He did it with a style that was very aggressive - that I think, fairly sometimes, he got criticized for going too strong. But on the other hand, I think the previous sort of gentlemanly approach, where we're going to softly talk about corruption or we're going to softly talk about cronyism, doesn't work in this media age,"" Schweizer argued.He made the interesting point that Trump's most important speech, although not the most colorful or most widely covered by the mainstream media, was the one he delivered in Gettysburg, where he called for ""draining the swamp"" of government corruption.""Lifetime bans on lobbying, we're gonna push term limits - I view that, in a way, as the most important speech because I think all the other things that he talked about: the trade deals, lousy trade deals, or an immigration policy that is totally distorted and doesn't reflect the interests of the American people, the tax code, all of those are key problems. But in my mind, they are symptoms of the larger problem, which is we have a political class in Washington that those policies are the result of this self-enrichment. We don't get those policies by random. We get them because we have a corrupted system, and people benefit from lousy trade deals. They get paid for putting together lousy trade deals,"" Schweizer said.""To me, the battle against the permanent political class, I think, is the core of what Trump needs to accomplish, and he knows we're seeing right now - I mean, look, as going back to the Reagan years. You know, Reagan's people had a statement: policy is personnel. We're gonna know a lot of the tenor and tone of his approach on these issues based on the people that get appointed to Cabinet positions and White House positions. There is, no doubt, a huge effort being made right now by the political class to co-opt Trump and say, 'Oh yeah, we know you said that, but here, this is how we really need to handle it,"" he predicted.Schweizer recommended keeping an eye on some key senior positions in the Trump White House as well as the people Trump appoints to head agencies like the Department of Education. ""Are you, in a sense, filling those slots - I understand you need to have people with experience, we all recognize that - but are you basically slotting those positions with the wrong type of experience or with people that really haven't been true believers in 'drain the swamp'""? he asked.""Remember, even a guy like Donald Trump with his strong personality, the guy that can sort of bend the hotel industry to his will, as he's done in the past - you're fighting a monolith, a very powerful monolith in Washington, D.C. You need to have reinforcements, and you need to know that when you tell the White House senior staff, 'I want to do this,' that they're not going to slowly drift off in a another direction that the Washington establishment wants more,"" he advised.Schweizer credited Trump's election victory to ""strong support from all sorts of different demographic groups,"" an uprising from people who see the D.C. political class as hopelessly obsessed with matters irrelevant to their daily lives, and widespread over-estimation of the Clinton political machine's power. He included himself and other conservatives in the latter category error.""You had high turnouts in lots of areas, but you also had a big drop-off in turnout in places like Detroit and Milwaukee,"" he observed. ""That is a reflection of how even traditional Democratic voters basically rejected Hillary Clinton.""He noted that Clinton's vaunted billion-dollar Get Out the Vote machine was on the ground throughout the election, but there just weren't enough people ""interested in pulling the lever for Hillary Clinton"" - which ""does offer hope that even people that have voted for the Democratic Party for decades, and perhaps have a financial interest themselves in public assistance and other things in voting for a democrat, even they could not be motivated enough to go and pull the lever for Hillary.""In contrast, he said, ""Even the staunchest critics of Donald Trump have to admit that his was a grassroots campaign.""""This was not a campaign that was based on a political machine, Get Out the Vote efforts, trying to corrupt the ballot booth. This was a genuine grassroots effort. People came out and voted because they'd had enough. They believed in Trump. They wanted to, in a sense, give the middle finger to the Washington establishment. For the Left, there's a lot of resources, a lot of money that was thrown into these Get Out the Vote efforts, some of the dirty politics that Project Veritas and James O'Keefe exposed, and they didn't make it,"" Schweizer observed.He spoke out against those political dirty tricks, declaring that ""every time somebody is allowed to vote twice or vote three times, it really does cancel out a legitimate vote from someone else.""Marlow asked Schweizer for his take on the Clinton scandals going forward, guessing that her email server scandal would probably ""go away,"" but speculating that at least four other corruption investigations of Clintonworld would go forward, particularly the Clinton Foundation pay-for-play abuses chronicled so extensively in Clinton Cash.Schweizer agreed that the Clinton Foundation probe would, and should, continue.""I've said this from the beginning, Alex. I've talked about this multiple times. I think it should, and I think the main reason is that it's not ultimately about the Clintons. It's about the Clintons' model,"" he contended. ""They've created this model for self-enrichment by taking foreign money. They set up this foundation. The spouse hits the lecture circuit. Look, in Washington, D.C., you figure out a way to get rich and get away with it through public service, everybody's gonna start doing it.""""So this goes beyond the Clintons. We are going to see a Secretary of Defense in the future, Republican or Democrat, do the same thing, if this is not thoroughly investigated and vetted,"" he warned.Schweizer added that the Clinton Foundation scandal was also about the rule of law: ""I mean, if we have a senior government official who engaged in corrupt practices, which I believe they did, it should be thoroughly investigated by the FBI, and if crimes were committed, they ought to face the consequences - as would a mid-level bureaucrat in government, as would a businessman or a blue-collar worker.""He anticipated much would come down to how the investigation of the Clinton Foundation was conducted.""People are saying Trump is going to investigate the Clintons. Donald Trump's not going to investigate the Clintons. The FBI is,"" Schweizer noted. ""The point is - and I think this is the way we ought to view all cases - you look at the evidence. The Clintons are certainly going to paint the picture that this is a partisan witch hunt. They've always attacked the messenger. That is always their strategy. They did it to me. They've done it to other people who have written critically about it. They're going to do it here.""""But I do believe if there is - and I think there is - very compelling evidence that the Clintons engaged in pay-to-play, I think you put it out there, and you prosecute. The American people will evaluate this, and come to the right conclusion, if indeed that evidence is there. I've always said I'm not a lawyer, but I think if you give the FBI the tools, the subpoenas, the things they need to investigate what they do, and if they come back and say, 'Look, we think there was shady stuff going on, but we don't think that in a court of law we can get a conviction,' that's fine. Everybody can say there was an investigation done, the professionals looked into it, we move on,"" he said.""But I think to just say, 'Well, she gets a free pass because she lost,' here's the problem with that: If she had won, she was gonna get a free pass because there's no way the FBI was going to investigate the sitting President of the United States and do so fairly. And now people are saying she's lost and she should get a free pass. You're saying they get a free pass regardless of what happens,"" Schweizer pointed out.He said the Clintons were motivated by their hunger for power and money, but added, ""I think deeply embedded in that is this sense of entitlement, that they are owed this. They are owed the money. They are owed the power.""Furthermore, Schweizer cited David Maraniss' biography of Bill Clinton from several years ago, First in His Class, which was ""generally sympathetic,"" but included testimony from Clinton's childhood friends about how he enjoyed breaking the rules and getting away with it, like the proverbial theft of cookies from the cookie jar.""This friend observed to Maraniss that for Bill, it really wasn't about the cookie. It wasn't about the ultimate payoff of the cookie. His motivation was really just thinking that he could get away with it, that he was smart enough to steal cookies from the cookie jar at home, and his mom not knowing about it,"" Schweizer said. ""That was the big payoff and thrill for Bill. So I think there is also just this sense of, no other president has done this before. Perhaps their hope is no other president will do it after. And this just proves how smart and brilliant they are, that they can get away with stuff that other people can't.""He took a moment to salute Breitbart News for its influence on the election, and its ability to resist mainstream media efforts to bury the Clinton scandals.""It's been an amazing election year, and I think Breitbart has been front and center. And to think about, with all the major media outlets, with large major budgets, with larger resources than Breitbart, that Breitbart was at the center of this national debate - it is really a testament to our readers, but also to the leadership that you provided, and the great work that so many reporters on the Breitbart staff have done. Bravo!"" Schweizer told Marlow.He concluded with a confession about his perspective on the 2016 race: ""I really thought it was hers to lose.""""I think primarily because you saw this major shift in major news outlets, where it became a parallel universe,"" he explained. ""When Clinton Cash came out last year, pretty much all the major news outlets do stories, positive stories about the book, supportive of our findings - that completely changed over the summer. It really became a sort of mantra started by the Clintons that, 'Well, this is all discredited.' That became the phraseology on CNN, on MSNBC, and by the Clinton team. And by looking at the Podesta emails - and, of course, Breitbart's done a great job of reporting this - you see how successful they are in collaborating with the media.""""I guess it's probably partly my age. I'm 51. I thought, well, you've got this big media outlet that just seems to kind of chug along and do their bidding for them,"" he reflected. ""I think I put too much faith in that, and I guess I did not put enough faith in the ability of the American people to seek out other sources of information and to basically say, 'Enough is enough.'"" ""So I was surprised, as a lot of people were,"" he admitted. ""Very happy. I think dynasties, whether Republican or Democrat, are not great for our country. And I really do think the bread-and-butter issue is corruption and cronyism. The reason we get bad trade deals, the reason we get bad tax policy, the reason we get crony deals is because of the political class. My hope is that that is where President-elect Trump focuses his attention.""Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.LISTEN:SIGN UPSchweizer pointed to a few key strategies that helped Donald Trump overcome the powerful political and media forces arrayed against him.""Number one, he articulated an outsider message about Washington, D.C., but Number two, he really did make this a referendum on the Clintons, and also frankly on Washington, D.C. I mean, the Clintons are kind of the alphas of corruption, creating a political machine, running that machine with peak efficiency, dominating our politics, excluding ordinary Americans from how they operate,"" said Schweizer.""But they're not the only ones that do that,"" he continued. ""And, of course, you have to remember, in a way, Donald Trump defeated two dynasties: the Bush dynasty in the primary, and the Clinton dynasty now. That is an amazing feat. I think it speaks to the attitude of the country that while there was this sort of veneer in the mainstream media of, oh, people kind of like dynasties, like the Kennedys and Camelot. That really wasn't the reality. People didn't like this notion of entitlements, and now it's Hillary's turn, or now it's Jeb's turn. They wanted something fundamentally different.""""And you know, Trump did it his way. He did it with a style that was very aggressive - that I think, fairly sometimes, he got criticized for going too strong. But on the other hand, I think the previous sort of gentlemanly approach, where we're going to softly talk about corruption or we're going to softly talk about cronyism, doesn't work in this media age,"" Schweizer argued.He made the interesting point that Trump's most important speech, although not the most colorful or most widely covered by the mainstream media, was the one he delivered in Gettysburg, where he called for ""draining the swamp"" of government corruption.""Lifetime bans on lobbying, we're gonna push term limits - I view that, in a way, as the most important speech because I think all the other things that he talked about: the trade deals, lousy trade deals, or an immigration policy that is totally distorted and doesn't reflect the interests of the American people, the tax code, all of those are key problems. But in my mind, they are symptoms of the larger problem, which is we have a political class in Washington that those policies are the result of this self-enrichment. We don't get those policies by random. We get them because we have a corrupted system, and people benefit from lousy trade deals. They get paid for putting together lousy trade deals,"" Schweizer said.""To me, the battle against the permanent political class, I think, is the core of what Trump needs to accomplish, and he knows we're seeing right now - I mean, look, as going back to the Reagan years. You know, Reagan's people had a statement: policy is personnel. We're gonna know a lot of the tenor and tone of his approach on these issues based on the people that get appointed to Cabinet positions and White House positions. There is, no doubt, a huge effort being made right now by the political class to co-opt Trump and say, 'Oh yeah, we know you said that, but here, this is how we really need to handle it,"" he predicted.Schweizer recommended keeping an eye on some key senior positions in the Trump White House as well as the people Trump appoints to head agencies like the Department of Education. ""Are you, in a sense, filling those slots - I understand you need to have people with experience, we all recognize that - but are you basically slotting those positions with the wrong type of experience or with people that really haven't been true believers in 'drain the swamp'""? he asked.""Remember, even a guy like Donald Trump with his strong personality, the guy that can sort of bend the hotel industry to his will, as he's done in the past - you're fighting a monolith, a very powerful monolith in Washington, D.C. You need to have reinforcements, and you need to know that when you tell the White House senior staff, 'I want to do this,' that they're not going to slowly drift off in a another direction that the Washington establishment wants more,"" he advised.Schweizer credited Trump's election victory to ""strong support from all sorts of different demographic groups,"" an uprising from people who see the D.C. political class as hopelessly obsessed with matters irrelevant to their daily lives, and widespread over-estimation of the Clinton political machine's power. He included himself and other conservatives in the latter category error.""You had high turnouts in lots of areas, but you also had a big drop-off in turnout in places like Detroit and Milwaukee,"" he observed. ""That is a reflection of how even traditional Democratic voters basically rejected Hillary Clinton.""He noted that Clinton's vaunted billion-dollar Get Out the Vote machine was on the ground throughout the election, but there just weren't enough people ""interested in pulling the lever for Hillary Clinton"" - which ""does offer hope that even people that have voted for the Democratic Party for decades, and perhaps have a financial interest themselves in public assistance and other things in voting for a democrat, even they could not be motivated enough to go and pull the lever for Hillary.""In contrast, he said, ""Even the staunchest critics of Donald Trump have to admit that his was a grassroots campaign.""""This was not a campaign that was based on a political machine, Get Out the Vote efforts, trying to corrupt the ballot booth. This was a genuine grassroots effort. People came out and voted because they'd had enough. They believed in Trump. They wanted to, in a sense, give the middle finger to the Washington establishment. For the Left, there's a lot of resources, a lot of money that was thrown into these Get Out the Vote efforts, some of the dirty politics that Project Veritas and James O'Keefe exposed, and they didn't make it,"" Schweizer observed.He spoke out against those political dirty tricks, declaring that ""every time somebody is allowed to vote twice or vote three times, it really does cancel out a legitimate vote from someone else.""Marlow asked Schweizer for his take on the Clinton scandals going forward, guessing that her email server scandal would probably ""go away,"" but speculating that at least four other corruption investigations of Clintonworld would go forward, particularly the Clinton Foundation pay-for-play abuses chronicled so extensively in Clinton Cash.Schweizer agreed that the Clinton Foundation probe would, and should, continue.""I've said this from the beginning, Alex. I've talked about this multiple times. I think it should, and I think the main reason is that it's not ultimately about the Clintons. It's about the Clintons' model"" he contended. ""They've created this model for self-enrichment by taking foreign money. They set up this foundation. The spouse hits the lecture circuit. Look, in Washington, D.C., you figure out a way to get rich and get away with it through public service, everybody's gonna start doing it.""""So this goes beyond the Clintons. We are going to see a Secretary of Defense in the future, Republican or Democrat, do the same thing, if this is not thoroughly investigated and vetted,"" he warned.Schweizer added that the Clinton Foundation scandal was also about the rule of law: ""I mean, if we have a senior government official who engaged in corrupt practices, which I believe they did, it should be thoroughly investigated by the FBI, and if crimes were committed, they ought to face the consequences - as would a mid-level bureaucrat in government, as would a businessman or a blue-collar worker.""He anticipated much would come down to how the investigation of the Clinton Foundation was conducted.""People are saying Trump is going to investigate the Clintons. Donald Trump's not going to investigate the Clintons. The FBI is,"" Schweizer noted. ""The point is - and I think this is the way we ought to view all cases - you look at the evidence. The Clintons are certainly going to paint the picture that this is a partisan witch hunt. They've always attacked the messenger. That is always their strategy. They did it to me. They've done it to other people who have written critically about it. They're going to do it here.""""But I do believe if there is - and I think there is - very compelling evidence that the Clintons engaged in pay-to-play, I think you put it out there, and you prosecute. The American people will evaluate this, and come to the right conclusion, if indeed that evidence is there. I've always said I'm not a lawyer, but I think if you give the FBI the tools, the subpoenas, the things they need to investigate what they do, and if they come back and say, 'Look, we think there was shady stuff going on, but we don't think that in a court of law we can get a conviction,' that's fine. Everybody can say there was an investigation done, the professionals looked into it, we move on,"" he said.""But I think to just say, 'Well, she gets a free pass because she lost,' here's the problem with that: If she had won she was gonna get a free pass because there's no way the FBI was going to investigate the sitting President of the United States and do so fairly. And now people are saying she's lost and she should get a free pass.

Ruger's numbers ""were down 12.29 percent in early morning trading."" Speculation has already begun as to how Trump's election may impact Black Friday gun sales.Black Friday 2015 sales ""shattered"" the previous Black Friday record and the single day record, with 185,345 background checks on that one day. And The Guardian notes that those checks were driven, in part, by the gun control push undertaken by Hillary Clinton the month before.Trump ran on saving the Second Amendment from ""people like Hillary Clinton."" He has many times pointed out that mass public attacks are not the fault of guns, but of the evil or twisted humans who carry out the attacks. Trump also sees ""gun-free zones"" as a contributing factor.In fact, on October 28, 2015, he said gun-free zones provide ""target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill."" So his solution to high profile gun crimes is not more gun control, but more citizens armed for self-defense in more places. He sees value in the armed citizen and believes the concealed carry license of one state ought to be recognized in every state. Trump said:The right of self-defense doesn't stop at the end of your driveway. That's why I have a concealed carry permit and why tens of millions of Americans do too. That permit should be valid in all 50 states. A driver's license works in every state, so it's common sense that a concealed carry permit should work in every state. If we can do that for driving - which is a privilege, not a right - then surely we can do that for concealed carry, which is a right, not a privilege.The bottom line-Trump's election marks a seismic shift in gun policy in the U.S. We are embarking on an era where the Second Amendment stands strong under Heller and the armed citizen, in turn, stands strong under the Second Amendment.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of ""Bullets with AWR Hawkins,"" a Breitbart News podcast.

Roger Williams: I Have the Votes for NRCC Chairman	"Texas Congressman Roger Williams tells Breitbart News he has the votes to become the next chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""We've been calling everybody and we are getting very little push back,"" said Rep. Williams, who is challenging Ohio's Rep. Steven Stivers, the current deputy chairman of the House Republican's political wing and a close ally of the outgoing NRCC chairman, Rep. Greg Walden.Stivers was contacted by Breitbart News and the congressman's spokesman said the Ohioan would not be giving interviews until after the NRCC election. House Republicans return to Washington next week, when a vote is expected to take place.""People agree with our message and they are getting on board,"" Williams said. ""I am sure the other side is counting, too-our numbers show we got this.""Williams, who was a farm hand in the Atlanta Braves system in the late 1960s and early 1970s, was elected to Texas' 25th congressional district in 2012, but he has already made an impact because of his ability to raise funds for himself, his colleagues and the party. In 1994 and 1998, Williams was a fundraiser for Texas Gov. George W. Bush and he continued to raise money for Bush through his 2000 and 2004 presidential campaign. In the 2004 campaign, Williams was the national grassroots fundraising chairman.A very successful 2014 cycle saw House Republicans gaining their highest membership, 247, since 1929 - a 13 seat pickup. And in 2016, the Republicans lost six seats, but held control of the chamber with 239 out of 435 seats.Despite the NRCC's success, Williams says its business model is busted.""We're getting out raised by the other side,"" he said. Because so much of the committee's cash comes from member dues and not outside organizations or individuals, so the committee set up to support congressmen campaigning, is actually just circulating the much of same money around.""In 2004, 78 percent of the NRCC budget came from outside the House Republican Conference members, he said. In the 2014, it was at 38 percent. In 2004, 12 percent of the funds for the committee came from the member dues and now it is more than 60 percent.""The burden of the dues on the members is breaking the backbone of the NRCC,"" he said. Another challenge is that roughly 60 percent of the members of the GOP conference pay their dues.The new structure Williams proposed would cut the dues to $250,000 per cycle with bump ups for congressman in leadership and committee and subcommittee chairmen.By dropping the price of the dues, the Texan said he expects to bring in more money because dues are the main reason why roughly 40 percent of the GOP conference has decided not to pay dues at all.Williams said he would also reach out to his own network of professional athletes to support the fundraising and form a speakers bureau that would book the athletes on speaking tours, where they could share the conservative message of the House Republicans.If elected, Williams said he would also upgrade the professionalism at the committee and provide customer service to donors and members.Many key Members of Congress supporting Williams told Breitbart News they were voting for him because he is looking to reboot the NRCC's fundraising and his commitment to recruiting candidates.The chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Utah's Rep. Jason Chaffetz, told Breitbart News, he first heard of Williams, when he saw his ""The Donkey Whisper"" video, a send up of the Robert Redford role as ""The Horse Whisperer""-but, with Williams talking to donkeys.""Roger is a very dynamic person,"" Chaffetz said. ""He's got great energy. He'd be fabulous in recruiting members. He knows how to raise money and he is a rock solid conservative.""Williams recognizes the need to recruit great candidates early in the cycle and in areas where Republicans have ceased to be competitive, such a the Northeast and California, he said.The Utah congressman said he appreciates the job that Walden and his deputy Stivers put into the NRCC. ""We've had great success, Steve Stivers has poured his heart and soul into it, but I think Roger has a vision of how to change the model moving forward.""Watch ""The Donkey Whisperer""Western New York's Rep. Christopher Collins, the first congressman to endorse President-elect Donald J. Trump, said to Breitbart News he is voting for Williams for the same reasons he supported Trump.""A CEO, a private-sector guy, who understands fiscal discipline, great man, focused on the end game, which is, obviously, electing Republicans in Congress and picking up seats,"" he said.""In terms of fund raising, there is no more prolific fund raiser outside of our leadership team than Roger Williams,"" Collins said.One time, Collins said Williams told him that he made a fundraising call at 11 p.m., because he knew the target would be home. ""Then, he told the guy: 'I'm not getting off the phone until you give me a check for $10,000.'""Collins said he agrees with Rogers that members should pay lower dues and the dues schedule needs to be flattened.""I know that if he says he's going to do it, he's going to do it,"" he said. ""There is all this pressure on members, if you don't pay your dues, you may not get the committee assignments you are looking for-it is what it is, it's one of the things that is always looked at-who's current on their dues? Who's paying their dues?""Collins said he is charged $450,000 per election cycle. ""That's a lot of money.""New Mexico's Rep. Steve Pearce told Breitbart his concern about the NRCC's dues structure led him to support Williams.Pearce said he believes Williams can reverse the trend of more and more of the NRCC's budget financed by members themselves and less and less from outside groups and contributors.""As a business guy, anytime you let your donor or revenue base shrink to a smaller and smaller group of people, you have bigger troubles-and I think that is the key,"" he said. ""He knows a lot of people. He can bring those people in to help us to do our jobs.""South Carolina's Rep. Tom Rice told Breitbart News he chose to support Williams because Stivers seems ""old guard"" to him and he is looking for a new approach.California's Rep. Duncan Hunter, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan as a Marine officer, told Breitbart News he likes both candidates and if either one wins, the NRCC will be fine, but he is supporting Williams.""Number one, he is a friend of mine,"" said Hunter. ""He knows his stuff, he knows how to raise money. He understands the business world and his is a businessman-that is what the NRCC should be about.""Hunter said he does not need to change direction and he has been very happy with the current chairman, Oregon's Rep. Greg Walden.""We've raised a lot of money-not nearly as much as the Democrats did last time around, but it wasn't for lack of trying-no complaints,"" he said.Hunter said the bottom line is that Williams has the experience and the skills to get the job done.""He knows how to do it-and he's a great guy. I just like him.""SIGN UP"

The website says it is seeking 100,000 signatories - this after 131,741,000 voted.The text states:""The Electoral College has outlasted its usefulness. It is part of the constitution, written when communication was by pony express.Voters currently living and voting in a 'red' or 'blue' state are disenfranchised, because their vote doesn't matter. Eliminating the electoral college means: no 'swing' states getting all the attention and all the campaign stops and all the empty campaign promises. The electoral members are selected by the two main political parties, Republican and Democrat, disenfranchising all other voters, independent, Libertarian, etc. End it now.""MoveOn.org is being used as the platform for the petition by author Thomas Reich, and the group's main petition website prominently features the petition.The petition comes as the latest tallies seem to show Hillary Clinton winning 200,000 more in the national popular vote, while Trump is the clear Electoral College winner.The move follows another petition launched on MoveOn's website after Tuesday's vote, also authored by Reich, that called for the Electoral College to cast their votes for Hillary Clinton despite Trump's Electoral College majority.That petition has since been removed from the left-wing group's website.PJ Media reported the petition was titled, ""Tell the Electoral College to cast their votes for Hillary Clinton.""Meanwhile, over 2 million people have signed a Change.org petition also demanding that the Electoral College ignore their states' votes and make Clinton the president.That petition states:On December 19, the Electors of the Electoral College will cast their ballots. If they all vote the way their states voted, Donald Trump will win. However, they can vote for Hillary Clinton if they choose. Even in states where that is not allowed, their vote would still be counted, they would simply pay a small fine - which we can be sure Clinton supporters will be glad to pay!We are calling on the Electors to ignore their states' votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton.The petition calling for the Electoral College to be eliminated does not explain how that monumental task is to be achieved. However, there is a separate movement titled the National Popular Vote, or NPV, which would guarantee the presidency to the winner of the popular vote without ratifying the Constitution and without the full agreement of every state.The movement's website explains:The U.S. Constitution (Article II, Section 1) gives the states exclusive control over awarding their electoral votes: ""Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors...."" The winner-take-all rule was used by only three states in 1789.The National Popular Vote interstate compact would not take effect until enacted by states possessing a majority of the electoral votes--that is, enough to elect a President (270 of 538). Under the compact, the winner would be the candidate who received the most popular votes from all 50 states (and DC) on Election Day. When the Electoral College meets in mid-December, the national popular vote winner would receive all of the electoral votes of the enacting states.I previously reported on the NPV scheme:The NPV campaign seeks to obtain the consent of the majority of the 538 votes in the Electoral College to award electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote instead of the winner of the popular vote in each state.Aside from New York, other states that already signed up are the heavily blue states of Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Washington, Vermont, California and Rhode Island. The District of Columbia also has joined the pact.The states will not be required to award their electoral votes to the national popular vote winner until the NPV has signed up enough states to garner 270 electoral votes....The Founding Fathers firmly rejected a purely popular vote to elect the president, because they wanted to balance the power of the larger and smaller states. The Electoral College was fashioned as a compromise between an election of the president by direct popular vote and election by Congress.Now the NPV effort could change the way Americans elect the president without amending the U.S. Constitution. The plan simply requires that enough states join through votes in their legislatures along with gubernatorial approval.It takes two-thirds of both the House and Senate to pass a constitutional amendment to repeal the Electoral College.To bypass the constitutional amendment process, NPV minimizes the number of states that would need to agree. Instead, once enough states agree to allot its electoral votes to the national popular vote winner, the Electoral College becomes irrelevant.Aaron Klein is Breitbart's Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFrom Brooks' column:Finally, it seems important to be humbled and taught by this horrific election result. Trump's main problem in governing is not going to be some fascistic ideology; his main problem is going to be his own attention span, ignorance and incompetence. If he's left to bloviate while others are left to run the country and push through infrastructure plans, maybe things won't be disastrous.The job for the rest of us is to rebind the fabric of society, community by community, and to construct a political movement for the post-Trump era. I suspect the coming political movements will be identified on two axes: open and closed and individual and social.Those who believe in open believe in open trade, relatively open immigration, an active foreign policy and racial integration.

(Though New Hampshire, with its 4 electoral college votes has not yet been called, Clinton holds a 1,614 vote margin there-0.2 percent of votes cast in the state- with 100 percent of precincts reporting.)Clinton won the popular vote by 0.2 percent, or about 200,000 votes out of a total of 120 million total votes cast.A key shift of less than 0.1 percent of those votes-108,600-would have given us President-elect Clinton instead of President-elect Trump.Clinton's inattention on the campaign trail to these three ""Rust Belt"" states cost her dearly.As The Week, points out, Hillary Clinton failed to visit Wisconsin, even once, after April.It could have been even worse for the Clinton campaign. Trump, who only visited Minnesota once during the last month of the campaign (an overflow rally held Sunday at the Minneapolis airport), almost won that traditionally liberal state's 10 electoral college votes as well.The final tally there gave Clinton only a 42,951 vote victory-1.4 percent of the votes cast in the state. Sources in Minnesota tell Breitbart News that Trump may well have won the state had he held an additional campaign rally in Duluth during the last week of the campaign.Over the last month of the campaign, in contrast, Trump visited Pennsylvania and Michigan numerous times. By the time the Clinton campaign realized those two states were in play, it was too late to catch up, a realization that may not have completely been understood by the Clinton campaign until early Wednesday morning when the networks called Pennsylvania for Trump, putting him over the top and making him President-elect.""Political experts insisted that it was folly for Trump and his team to believe Michigan and Wisconsin were within their grasp. Pennsylvania was also said to be fool's gold for Republicans every four years. Trump's team ignored them--and struck a rich vein across the Rust Belt,"" Carl Cannon wrote at Real Clear Politics on Thursday after the shock of Trump's victory began to set in.Trump's team understood a number of things about these Rust Belt states the Clinton team missed.First, the anger at the loss of manufacturing jobs was much greater than the Clinton team ever realized. Opposition to NAFTA, which Trump pointed to as one of the major causes of these job losses, resonated with blue collar voters.Second, the National Rifle Association mounted a very aggressive and effective get-out-the-vote effort on Trump's behalf in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.Third, Clinton's support for increasing the number of Syrian refugees by 550 percent, and the number of refugees overall, was very unpopular with middle-class voters, especially in Michigan and Minnesota. Trump's promise to suspend the Syrian refugee resettlement program if elected, as well as the resettlement of refugees from countries that were hostile to voters, motivated many Rust Belt voters to back him.Trump's call for an end to the resettlement of refugees without the support of local communities during his Sunday rally in Minneapolis served to emphasize the difference between the two candidates at the very moment that the last few undecided Rust Belt voters were making up their minds.SIGN UP"

Other outlets, such as Yahoo News and the UK's the Independent, followed suit in the wake of the election of Donald Trump as the next president of the United States. The stories were published as if the rule was now in effect.A look at the Federal Register, however, shows the public comment period on the proposed rule ended October 7, but that HHS has not yet published any final regulations.Even Snopes.com attempted to clear things up for Planned Parenthood supporters that the new rule is not yet law and is not in effect.Nevertheless, the rumor mill was launched into service through social media:Last night, @POTUS signed a bill permanently protecting Planned Parenthood. Thank you Obama for everything, you are our hero -- buttercup v (@pvnk_princess) November 10, 2016Thank you @POTUS (Obama) for protecting #PlannedParenthood -- Abigail Ann (@abigailannn) November 10, 2016Obama just made a move to protect planned parenthood permanently so the republicans can never defund it, his last stand essentially.-- jordan rose (@maliagif) November 10, 2016As Breitbart News reported on September 6 about the proposed regulation, the Obama administration has sought to override state laws that redirect federal funding from abortion provider Planned Parenthood - its political ally - toward other health care centers that have met the federal government's criteria.These federally qualified health care centers (FQHCs) provide more comprehensive services than Planned Parenthood to low-income families. Nationally, there are 13,000 FQHCs - a figure that outnumbers Planned Parenthood facilities by 20 to 1.Despite the overwhelming number of FQHCs, however, the Obama Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) says that by redirecting funding away from Planned Parenthood, the states ""have interfered with"" low-income individuals' ability to access federal assistance quickly.In addition to misleading abortion supporters that the proposed rule is now in effect, the notion that President Obama can ""permanently"" ban states from redirecting federal funds away from Planned Parenthood is false.""Nothing is permanent in politics, including this rule that has no support in the law actually passed by Congress,"" Casey Mattox, senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom, tells Breitbart News.Mattox adds:States are free to allocate funds to providers that provide better care for women and families rather than abortion businesses that hurt women. Planned Parenthood spent $38 million to elect political cronies, but ultimately they will not even have this rule to show for it because they failed to get their candidate into the White House.Trump has promised to repeal and replace Obamacare and to appoint pro-life Supreme Court justices. The president-elect has also said Planned Parenthood should be defunded. Abortion proponents have experienced melt-downs following his stunning victory, even to the extent of urging women to have IUDs implanted prior to Trump's inauguration in order to obtain them for ""free,"" or, on the taxpayer's dime.Last night, @POTUS signed a bill permanently protecting Planned Parenthood.

She cited testimony gleaned from sources including a man who had survived an execution of some 50 former Iraqi soldiers by playing dead.""Clearly there are many other killing fields. We also have reports of other mass graves which we haven't yet been able to verify,"" Ms Shamdasani told reporters, mentioning sites at Mosul airport and the village of Tal al-Thahab.Iraqi troops had found large stockpiles of sulphur and there were credible reports that Isis had used ""phosphor projectiles"" over Qayyara, close to Mosul, Ms Shamdasani said.""Similar credible reports in Mosul state that they have placed sulphur pits in close proximity to civilians,"" she said.The UN's sources of information include people living in Isis-held areas who risk their lives to speak out.""We get so much information,"" Ms Shamdasani said, without going into details. ""We've been in Iraq a very long time.""
She said 40 civilians were reportedly shot on Tuesday for ""treason and collaboration"" with Iraqi government forces, and their bodies hung from electrical poles around Mosul.Mobile phoneThe same day a 27-year-old man was shot for using a mobile phone, Ms Shamdasani said. Six others had been hanged on October 20th for hiding SIM cards, and 20 more were reportedly shot on Wednesday for leaking information to the Iraqi security forces.Isis had deployed what it calls ""sons of the caliphate"" wearing explosive belts in the alleys of Old Mosul, and the UN had unconfirmed reports that they were teenagers and young boys, Ms Shamdasani said.Isis also announced on November 6th that it had beheaded seven of its own fighters for deserting the battlefield at Kokjali, Ms Shamdasani said.The UN had also verified an Isis propaganda video showing four children, purportedly including one Russian and one Uzbek, executing four people for spying.The UN had information that abducted women, including from the Yazidi minority, were being ""distributed"" to fighters or told they would be used to accompany Islamic State convoys, Ms Shamdasani said.""We're talking about war crimes, crimes against humanity, even genocide,"" she said.Meanwhile, Iraqi special forces said they pushed deeper into Mosul on Friday despite heavy resistance from militants using civilians as cover, and were holding half a dozen city neighbourhoods seized in the last 10 days.The elite Counter Terrorism Service troops broke through Isis defence lines to enter the city early last week and have since been embroiled in a brutal, close-quarter combat with waves of suicide bombers and snipers.The special forces are the spearhead of a wider coalition of 100,000 fighters seeking to crush a few thousand jihadists who have ruledMosul, the biggest city of their cross-border ""caliphate"" in Iraq and Syria, for the last two years.The campaign, nearly four weeks old, is the most complex military operation in Iraq in the 13 years of turmoil since the US invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein.Security forces and army infantry divisions, backed by a US-led air force, are preparing to move on southern and northern districts of Mosul in coming days, to step up pressure on the militants.Kurdish peshmerga and Shia paramilitary forces are holding territory to the northeast and to the west.On the eastern front, special forces pushed into the Qadisiya al-Thaniya district, on the northern edge of the small pocket of neighbourhoods they control so far, Sabah al-Numani, spokesman for the Counter Terrorism Service, told Reuters.""We have encountered heavy resistance from the enemy,"" he said, describing what he called ""obstructive patrols"" of militant forces trying to hold up the advance.""We are facing the most difficult form of urban warfare, fighting with the presence of civilians, but our forces are trained for this sort of combat.""Military officers have told Reuters that the fighting is some of the most lethal they have seen, with small groups of militants using a vast network of tunnels and narrow streets to launch an apparently endless sequence of attacks against troops.A Reuters correspondent in Kokjali, on the eastern edge of the city, saw US Apache helicopters overhead. Explosions, either from air strikes or suicide car bombs which the jihadists have deployed in the hundreds since the campaign started on October 17th, could be heard against a backdrop of artillery fire.As smoke rose above the city, hundreds of civilians were on the streets of Kokjali, some of them local residents but others fleeing the fighting in Mosul itself.The International Organization for Migration says nearly 48,000 people have been displaced by the fighting, still a relatively low figure compared to a UN warning before the campaign of a possible exodus of 700,000 or 800,000.Mr Numani said the army had told civilians to stay indoors for their safety, adding that the counter terrorism unit aimed to hand over neighbourhoods which it had secured to other forces. In other cities retaken from Isis, local police forces have moved in after the special forces have cleared territory.On Thursday, Iraqi soldiers advancing on the eastern side of the Tigris targeted two villages close to the ancient Assyrian city of Nimrud, a military statement said.Troops from the Ninth Armoured Division took control of one of them, the village of Abbas Rajab, 4km east of Nimrud, and raised the Iraqi flag, it said.The Iraqi government says Nimrud was bulldozed last year as part of Islamic State's campaign to destroy symbols which the Sunni Muslim zealots consider idolatrous. It would be the first such site to be recaptured from Isis. - (Reuters )SIGN UP"

He told me that we are now losing about as many jobs to offshoring as we are recovering. ""We've gone from losing somewhere around 200,000 manufacturing jobs a year in 2000 to 2003 to net breaking even,"" he explained. ""Balancing the trade deficit will increase U.S. manufacturing by about four million jobs at current levels of productivity""According to MarketWatch.com, the percentage of people who work in manufacturing is at a record low of 8.5%--which compares to ""20% in 1980, 30% in 1960 and a record 39% during World War Two.""While there are many factors driving offshoring, lower wages give countries like China and Mexico a competitive advantage. Energy costs, however, give the U.S. an advantage as ""manufacturers need a lot of energy to make their processes work,"" stated Gary Marmo, director of sales for New Jersey's Elizabethtown Gas. He says, ""A typical office building will use 5,000, 10,000, 20,000 therms a year. A good sized manufacturing plant will probably use that same amount in just a couple of days."" Electricity frequently represents one of the top operating costs for energy intensive industries such as plastics, metals, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals--and, according to a recent study comparing costs in the U.S. and China, electricity is about 50 percent higher in China.Because manufacturing is energy intensive, bringing industry back to the U.S. will increase our energy consumption.President Obama has derided U.S. energy use: ""The U.S. uses far more electricity than its North American neighbors combined,"" but the U.S. also does more with our energy. Comparing the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and energy consumption numbers for the U.S. and Canada, for example, both use a similar volume of energy but the U.S. has substantially higher GDP. A study of global energy consumption versus GDP found: ""energy is so intrinsically linked to GDP that energy policy more or less dictates how our economy performs.""Mike Haseler, the study's author, explains that ""rising GDP is an indication of a prosperous economy""--which is why economic commentators cite GDP numbers when they say: ""President Barack Obama may become the first president since Herbert Hoover not to serve during a year in which the growth in real GDP was at least 3 percent."" Yet, in the name of climate change, through government policy, many countries are trying to discourage energy use by forcing costs up. Haseler states: ""They are cutting energy use as the economy of Europe collapses because European industry can no longer compete with countries where energy prices are not artificially raised by senseless 'green' policies.""The energy advantage is not just an issue between countries, it is a factor in where companies locate within the U.S.""High electricity bills are a strong disincentive to create new jobs associated with a new or expanded product line,"" writes Don Welch, president of New Hampshire based Globe Manufacturing Co, LLC. New Hampshire's electric prices are 55.6 percent higher than the national average. Welch's company is the leading producer of firefighting turnout gear.Welch explains: ""higher electricity costs not only add hundreds of thousands of dollars to the cost of making our products--firefighting suits and equipment--but it's money we could otherwise re-invest in the business, including creating new jobs here in New Hampshire. New Hampshire's high electricity prices are a drag on our economy. It puts New Hampshire companies like mine at a competitive disadvantage compared to companies in other parts of the country.""Because Globe also has plants in three different states, he clearly sees the difference energy costs make in doing business. Welch says: ""I already know that the electric bill I am paying at my facility in Oklahoma is half of what I pay in New Hampshire."" If he is going to add a product line, energy costs are a big factor in deciding where to expand.If we can bring back manufacturing jobs--or at least stem the flow of them from our country--we need to be encouraging low-cost energy and making more of it available. Moser believes: ""balancing the trade deficit should be the number 1 national priority."" He told me that would take a 25 percent increase in manufacturing--which would require about a 10 percent increase in energy usage. Yet, climate change policies demand that we take greater cuts than the developing countries like China and India. If our energy costs continue to go up, as they have in New Hampshire, we'll lose the best competitive advantage we have.Moser explains, ""Manufacturing has the highest multiplier effect among the major sectors. Every job created in manufacturing creates additional jobs in other sectors that supply, support and service manufacturers.""To bring manufacturing back to the U.S., or encourage expansion, we need energy that is abundant, available and affordable--and we'll need to use more, not less. If we want to balance our trade deficit, boost GDP, and have a prosperous economy, energy is the key.

29	http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/11/11/smart-liberals-learn-painful-lessons-2016-election/	Liberals Realize They Helped Put Donald Trump in the White House	"Recent days have seen a rash of op-eds from liberals holding the Left accountable for the election of Donald Trump.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSome of this is solipsistic navel-gazing, a symptom of the very same bubbled thinking these liberals have realized is a problem. They're delivering Trump and his voters a backhanded insult by saying errors made by their own side were the primary determining factor in the election.Still, there are valid insights to be found in these articles, some of them probably quite painful to express. A bit of digging is required to find the insights in Thomas Frank's piece at the UK Guardian, for example, because he spends the first few paragraphs howling about how awful Donald Trump is.Once that primal scream is out of his system, the author of What's the Matter With Kansas? - a book whose thesis was that working-class folk were foolishly voting against their own material interests by supporting conservatives - Frank allows ""there was a reason that tens of millions of good people voted"" for Trump, and hopes he was serious about pledging to ""drain the swamp"" of D.C. corruption.Then he lays into Democrats for choosing Hillary Clinton as their candidate, chastising them for their obsession with credentials and their blinkered fealty to the political pecking order:Why, oh why, did it have to be Hillary Clinton? Yes, she has an impressive resume; yes, she worked hard on the campaign trail. But she was exactly the wrong candidate for this angry, populist moment. An insider when the country was screaming for an outsider. A technocrat who offered fine-tuning when the country wanted to take a sledgehammer to the machine.She was the Democratic candidate because it was her turn and because a Clinton victory would have moved every Democrat in Washington up a notch. Whether or not she would win was always a secondary matter, something that was taken for granted. Had winning been the party's number one concern, several more suitable candidates were ready to go. There was Joe Biden, with his powerful plainspoken style, and there was Bernie Sanders, an inspiring and largely scandal-free figure. Each of them would probably have beaten Trump, but neither of them would really have served the interests of the party insiders.And so Democratic leaders made Hillary their candidate even though they knew about her closeness to the banks, her fondness for war, and her unique vulnerability on the trade issue - each of which Trump exploited to the fullest. They chose Hillary even though they knew about her private email server. They chose her even though some of those who studied the Clinton Foundation suspected it was a sketchy proposition.To try to put over such a nominee while screaming that the Republican is a rightwing monster is to court disbelief. If Trump is a fascist, as liberals often said, Democrats should have put in their strongest player to stop him, not a party hack they'd chosen because it was her turn. Choosing her indicated either that Democrats didn't mean what they said about Trump's riskiness, that their opportunism took precedence over the country's well-being, or maybe both.Frank slams the left-wing media hard as well, for pushing Clinton in over-the-top ways that rang false to even casual news consumers. Since the public clearly wasn't equally in love with this ""peerless leader clad in saintly white,"" voters came to see her glowing media coverage as hostile and condescending toward them. As Frank puts it, the implication of much mainstream-media coverage was that only ""botched humans"" and racists would choose Trump over Clinton, which alienated much of the audience.""Maybe it's time to consider whether there's something about shrill self-righteousness, shouted from a position of high social status, that turns people away,"" Frank modestly suggests.He also criticizes the Democratic political establishment for growing complacent and assuming their vital constituencies ""have nowhere else to go and no role to play except to vote enthusiastically on the grounds that these Democrats are the 'last thing standing' between us and the end of the world.""This theme was taken up with brio by Jim Newell at Slate, who dismissed the moribund Democratic establishment as a ""joke"":I think of the lawmakers, the consultants, the operatives, and--yes--the center-left media, and how everything said over the past few years leading up to this night was bullshit.The midterm losses? That was just a bad cycle, structurally speaking; presidential demographics would make up for it. The party establishment made a grievous mistake rallying around Hillary Clinton. It wasn't just a lack of recent political seasoning. She was a bad candidate, with no message beyond heckling the opposite sideline. She was a total misfit for both the politics of 2016 and the energy of the Democratic Party as currently constituted. She could not escape her baggage, and she must own that failure herself.Theoretically smart people in the Democratic Party should have known that. And yet they worked giddily to clear the field for her. Every power-hungry young Democrat fresh out of law school, every rising lawmaker, every old friend of the Clintons wanted a piece of the action. This was their ride up the power chain.Newell zings the media for listening to Democrat operatives who claimed Clinton had a ""lock on the electoral college,"" but ""didn't know what they were talking about.""He blasts the insular Democratic Party establishment for indulging Hillary Clinton's sense of entitlement, media handlers for assuming she was scandal-proof because she'd been involved in so many scandals over the years, crack election analysts who didn't realize Clinton needed to visit Wisconsin while Trump was storming the Rust Belt, and left-leaning commentators (including himself) who overestimated the schism in the Republican Party while failing to notice the Democrat crack-up that was brewing.Most of those criticisms could be leveled at conservative media as well. The Democrats' growing demographic lock on the Electoral College, for instance, is accepted as grim reality by a lot of people who are profoundly unhappy with it.Right-leaning critics of Trump have been running all sorts of what-if scenarios, both before and after Election Day, to argue that other 2016 GOP candidates could have done even better than Trump did. They should consider the possibility that Trump shook up the electoral map in a way none of the other candidates could have - which of them was going to win Wisconsin, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, and make Minnesota a squeaker? Some of the other candidates could have won in different ways, in part because Hillary Clinton was a uniquely awful candidate, but for many of them, the tired Democratic assumptions about the electoral map that Newell assails would have been essentially correct.Newell's point about the lopsided media emphasis on Republican civil war is interesting, too. Was that partially because the conservative NeverTrump movement appeared disproportionately strong on social media, and so many reporters form their political impressions by studying social media these days?Republican voters largely ""came home"" to Trump in the end, and Democrats mostly came home to Clinton, despite many of Bernie Sanders' supporters loudly stating they would never vote for her. However, many Democrats stayed home. Clinton's weakness with Democrats was her undoing. Newell is correct to argue that liberal media's prejudices prevented it from understanding that not only was there a Democrat schism, but in the end it was more serious and immediate than the Republican schism.The question going forward will be how much of this was due to Clinton personally, and the way she firmed Republican resolve while disenchanting so many Democrat voters. (Newell thinks the Bernie Sanders / Elizabeth Warren wing of the party is the future, which will only be true if more Americans forget what socialism really is. Maybe Venezuela will be out of the news by 2020...)The Wall Street Journal finds some Democrats staggering through the ruins of the 2016 election, looking for a more ""fresh"" and ""inclusive"" approach, which is funny for a party that was bragging about its youth and diversity the day before it collapsed.One Democratic fundraiser quoted by the WSJ bizarrely complained about how the party leadership was too old to attract young voters, which would certainly come as news to Bernie Sanders. The real problem is that Democrats have little to offer young voters who are concerned about real and serious issues, not the social-justice claptrap Democrats obsess over.Young voters who are seriously thinking about career and family are the ones Democrats need to worry about, and Bernie Sanders sure as hell doesn't have anything meaningful to say to them. They don't seem to have fallen for Hillary Clinton's argument that she could whip the private sector with tax increases until it started creating more jobs, either.The Journal quotes Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-AZ) complaining that Democrat strategy boils down to ""raise a lot of money, keep recycling the same consultants and pollsters and strategies, and we'll be OK. Well, we're not OK.""That's a fair point, but three days ago, comparably hidebound Republicans were laughing at Donald Trump for seeking guidance beyond the same old recycled consultants, pollsters, and strategies. They were snarking that Trump pollster Kellyanne Conway was out of her mind, that Trump was deciding where to hold his rallies by throwing darts at a map.The GOP Establishment's post-2012 action plan was to throw in the towel on issues that only irrelevant white people in red states cared about... and now here's the Wall Street Journal, quoting a few Democrats who are essentially arguing that their party has to grow more conservative and find a way to communicate with Middle American whites, if it wants to survive. (Of course, most of the solons who appear in the WSJ piece want to move the Democrats further to the Left. If that advice is followed, Donald Trump probably won't have much trouble getting re-elected in 2020.)Will Rahn at CBS News thinks the ""unbearable smugness of the press"" played a major role in Trump's victory, chastising Big Media for ""mocking the people who had a better sense of what was going on.""The audience for our glib analysis and contempt for much of the electorate, it turned out, was rather limited. This was particularly true when it came to voters, the ones who turned out by the millions to deliver not only a rebuke to the political system but also the people who cover it. Trump knew what he was doingwhen he invited his crowds to jeer and hiss the reporters covering him. They hate us, and have for some time.And can you blame them? Journalists love mocking Trump supporters. We insult their appearances. We dismiss them as racists and sexists. We emote on Twitter about how this or that comment or policy makes us feel one way or the other, and yet we reject their feelings as invalid.It's a profound failure of empathy in the service of endless posturing. There's been some sympathy from the press, sure: the dispatches from ""heroin country"" that read like reports from colonial administrators checking in on the natives. But much of that starts from the assumption that Trump voters are backward, and that it's our duty to catalogue and ultimately reverse that backwardness.Rahn fires a shot across the rest of the media's bow for entertaining yet another round of smug theories, such as dismissing Trump's victory as a ""whitelash"" by racists and sexists who can't handle the brave new world of ""fairness, equality, and progress.""He offers the interesting suggestion that Left-media has gotten much worse since the advent of social media platforms like Twitter, which has been a powerful incubator for their smugness, because they've been watching rabid liberal mobs shut down dissenting opinions online, and imbibing deeply from biased ""fact-checking"" websites that think they can end arguments with Olympian decrees of Absolute Truth. They falsely assumed the 2016 election would work the same way.""As a direct result, we get it wrong with greater frequency. Out on the road, we forget to ask the right questions. We can't even imagine the right question. We go into assignments too certain that what we find will serve to justify our biases. The public's estimation of the press declines even further - fewer than one-in-three Americans trust the press, per Gallup - which starts the cycle anew,"" Rahn argues.He's put his finger on the big problem for post-Obama liberalism: the public distrusts Big Government and Big Media for good reasons. The Left greatly overestimated the public's ability to remember the pratfalls of Barack Obama's ineptocracy, where failure had no consequences and accountability meant mouthing the words ""I take responsibility"" without meaning a single syllable of it.They misinterpreted Obama's approval ratings as positive approval of his presidency, when it was really a combination of the bad polling methods that got the 2016 election so horribly wrong, and Obama's ability to personally evade responsibility for his many disasters. He was pretty good at convincing people he was a hapless spectator to everything that has gone wrong since 2009. Not many people wanted another four years of it, and Hillary Clinton lacked his charm.The repudiation Democrats just suffered at the ballot box was so astoundingly comprehensive that it's impossible to argue voters approve of the Obama presidency. Actually, his time in the Oval Office has been one long death march for his party, which - as Newell pointed out in his fiery editorial - doesn't really control anything any more. Rahn is right to argue that a smug ideology is incapable of learning meaningful lessons from disaster. Frank is correct to warn that the Democratic Party's corrupt leadership was too busy rigging the primary in Clinton's favor to study what their own voters were saying, never mind what the hated Republican electorate wanted.The GOP has problems too, but they're nowhere near as intractable as the sickness Democrats refused to acknowledge until they slid under the table and blacked out, at a little past midnight on Election Eve. On the bright side, they've got four years for diagnosis and treatment, and triumphant Republicans had better not forget that's a long time in modern politics.Why, oh why, did it have to be Hillary Clinton? Yes, she has an impressive resume; yes, she worked hard on the campaign trail. But she was exactly the wrong candidate for this angry, populist moment. An insider when the country was screaming for an outsider. A technocrat who offered fine-tuning when the country wanted to take a sledgehammer to the machine.
She was the Democratic candidate because it was her turn and because a Clinton victory would have moved every Democrat in Washington up a notch. Whether or not she would win was always a secondary matter, something that was taken for granted. Had winning been the party's number one concern, several more suitable candidates were ready to go. There was Joe Biden, with his powerful plainspoken style, and there was Bernie Sanders, an inspiring and largely scandal-free figure. Each of them would probably have beaten Trump, but neither of them would really have served the interests of the party insiders.
var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([""embed""]);And so Democratic leaders made Hillary their candidate even though they knew about her closeness to the banks, her fondness for war, and her unique vulnerability on the trade issue - each of which Trump exploited to the fullest. They chose Hillary even though they knew about her private email server. They chose her even though some of those who studied the Clinton Foundation suspected it was a sketchy proposition.
To try to put over such a nominee while screaming that the Republican is a rightwing monster is to court disbelief. If Trump is a fascist, as liberals often said, Democrats should have put in their strongest player to stop him, not a party hack they'd chosen because it was her turn. Choosing her indicated either that Democrats didn't mean what they said about Trump's riskiness, that their opportunism took precedence over the country's well-being, or maybe both.I think of the lawmakers, the consultants, the operatives, and--yes--the center-left media, and how everything said over the past few years leading up to this night was bullshit.

The midterm losses? That was just a bad cycle, structurally speaking; presidential demographics would make up for it. The party establishment made a grievous mistake rallying around Hillary Clinton. It wasn't just a lack of recent political seasoning. She was a bad candidate, with no message beyond heckling the opposite sideline. She was a total misfit for both the politics of 2016 and the energy of the Democratic Party as currently constituted. She could not escape her baggage, and she must own that failure herself.

Theoretically smart people in the Democratic Party should have known that. And yet they worked giddily to clear the field for her. Every power-hungry young Democrat fresh out of law school, every rising lawmaker, every old friend of the Clintons wanted a piece of the action. This was their ride up the power chain.The audience for our glib analysis and contempt for much of the electorate, it turned out, was rather limited. This was particularly true when it came to voters, the ones who turned out by the millions to deliver not only a rebuke to the political system but also the people who cover it. Trump knew what he was doingwhen he invited his crowds to jeer and hiss the reporters covering him. They hate us, and have for some time.
