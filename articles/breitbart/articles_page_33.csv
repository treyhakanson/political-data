And 3TV News reports that gun stores that usually see a run on guns in general during an election season are seeing a run on AR-15s in particular this time around.For example, Veerchart Murphy, who owns Ammo AZ in Phoenix, says he ""sold three times more AR-15's in October that he did in September."" He said AR-15 sales are up ""550 percent"" over last year.In addition to the focus on AR-15s, Ruger firearms witnessed an explosion in profits. Business Insider reports Ruger's third-quarter saw ""net sales rose 34 percent year-on-year to $161.4 million."" This followed a second quarter in which Ruger CEO Michael Fifer asked ""customers and all freedom-loving Americans to take action in support of the Second Amendment.""Ruger announced that ""it would donate $2 to the National Rifle Association for every gun it sells, and would match all donations to the NRA up to $5 million until the election on November 8.""AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of ""Bullets with AWR Hawkins,"" a Breitbart News podcast.

It's not a question. It's a statement.""The actress continues to repeat the line about Clinton's honesty and trustworthiness as if it's a question and not a statement, before finally giving up and muttering, ""Stupid script.""The Defeat Crooked Hillary PAC is putting $500,000 behind the ad, which is aimed at swaying undecided voters in Florida. Like the first ad, this one appears micro-targeted at women and millennial voters in particular.The 30-second spot will air in Florida's 1-4 corridor television markets spanning from Tampa and Orlando to Daytona Beach.Hogan Gidley, the PAC's communications director, said that FBI Director James Comey's decision last week to reopen the investigation into Clinton's mishandling of classified emails while secretary of state makes this latest ad all the more timely.""On the heels of FBI Director Comey reopening the investigation into Hillary's corruption, 'questions' are exactly what voters have. That makes 'Questions' the perfect ad to run at this point in the election,"" Gidley stated.""First, digital media testing shows the ad's theme - Hillary Clinton's dishonesty and untrustworthiness - is effective at swaying male and female undecided voters away from voting for Hillary. Second, with millions of ads blanketing the airways, humor is a great way to cut through the campaign clutter and make the ad memorable. This ad accomplishes exactly that,"" he added.The PAC's strategy of targeting Clinton's honesty and trustworthiness appears to be bearing fruit. The latest Washington Post-ABC News Tracking Poll shows Republican nominee Donald Trump leading Clinton by 8 points, or 46 to 38 percent, on the issue of which candidate is ""honest and trustworthy.""SIGN UP"

That is an increase of 356,780 background checks.The new record also makes October 2016 the 18th consecutive month of record background checks, thereby continuing a pattern that we have seen monthly beginning May 2015.Breitbart News reported that the number of background checks conducted in September 2016 exceeded the previous September record by nearly 200,000. Prior to that, the number of background checks performed in August exceeded the previous August record by nearly 100,000. The number of background checks performed in July 2016 exceeded the previous July record by nearly 600,000.Remember that the number of background checks conducted in a single month is not a precise indicator of the number of guns sold. This is because background checks are conducted on the buyer rather than the number of guns purchased by the buyer. This means 2,333,539 background checks for October 2016 may actually represent 4,667,078 guns sold (if every buyer purchases two guns). And if every buyer purchased three guns it means more than seven million guns would have been sold at retail in October alone.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of ""Bullets with AWR Hawkins,"" a Breitbart News podcast.

Bernie Sanders of Vermont is working for Hillary Clinton in New England.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIn New Hampshire -- where a recent poll shows Donald Trump leads -- and Maine, where Trump is bidding for at least one electoral vote, Sanders urges undecided citizens to ""get out the vote"" and save Clinton's campaign.""This has been an ugly and distasteful campaign and people cannot wait for it to be over,"" Sanders told the crowd at Plymouth State University in New Hampshire. ""This campaign is not about Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, believe it or not,"" Sanders said. ""Shock of all shocks, this campaign is about you,"" he said.Sanders, who had strong support from millennials in the primary, is trying to help Clinton among that demographic. He was also stumping for Maggie Hassan, New Hampshire's Democratic governor and a candidate for U.S. Senate.""I don't want to make you all nervous here in New Hampshire, but you have a lot of responsibility on your shoulders,"" he said. ""You are a battleground state, and the future of this country may rest on your four electoral votes for president and on who you elect for the United States Senate.""He discussed the same talking points he had pushed during his own candidacy, including free college tuition, a living wage, and waging a war against the top one percent.Following his talk at Plymouth State University, Sanders addressed another crowd at Dartmouth College in Hanover, before ending the day with a third rally in Portland, Maine.The rallies are part of Sanders's planned coast-to-coast trip that will take him through 12 states and end in California.Sanders also held a ""Get Out the Vote"" rally in Portland, Maine Tuesday evening; a state where Clinton and Trump are in a statistical tie. Maine splits its 4 electoral votes based on the state's two congressional districts. The winner of the first district wins three electoral votes, while the winner of the second district wins one electoral vote.""Hillary Clinton will win Maine if there is a high voter turnout, she will lose if there's low voter turnout,"" Sanders said at Deering High School, a phrase he has spoken several times before. He added, ""those four electoral votes could literally make the difference as to who the next president of the United States is.""Sanders also reached out to blue collar workers -- a demographic Trump has done well with -- and attempted to convicne them that Clinton will help bring back jobs they've lost as a result of outsourcing and mill closures; a point Trump has laid out a plan for achieveing as president.""We can make America safer, and more productive,"" and ""create many millions of good-paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure,"" Sanders said. ""That is what Hillary Clinton wants to do. That is what we must do.""Sanders won Maine by nearly 30 percentage points during the Democratic caucuses against Clinton back in March.A newly released Los Angeles Times tracking poll has Trump leading Clinton by 5.4 percent.Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope @AdelleNazSIGN UP@AdelleNaz"

They're populists. That resonates with me.""Trump and Bernie care about people, instead of enriching themselves and their donors.""
Asked if Sanders's decision to support Hillary Clinton carried any weight with her, she answered:""Not at all. I feel like he was coerced into supporting her. I believe he was beaten into submission, beaten into supporting her.""I could not, in good conscience, vote for Hillary Clinton and sleep at night,"" she concluded.
Her boyfriend, Enzo, said that he had supported Trump from the beginning, because he ""wasn't a politician.""He predicted that Trump would win the Sunshine State.""I'm Cuban-American, and the narrative that Hispanics are voting for Clinton isn't true. All the Cubans I know who are Democrats -- including my parents' friends -- are all for Trump.""People who are voting for Hillary Clinton just don't like Trump, but they aren't enthusiastic."" He speculated that reluctant Hillary Clinton supporters might not turn out at all.
Over 4,200 turned out for the rally at Miami's Bayfront Park Amphitheater, the first of four stops for the Trump campaign in Florida over 24 hours, including Orlando, Pensacola, and Jacksonville.Joel B.

Absolutely my hero during all of that time. I could go to Drudge and know what was going on or you could go to the mainstream media, which Drudge now is. I mean they blasted him. This man stood up for us. Matt Drudge is our hero."" Willey and Jones expressed agreement.""And Aaron, you have been very fair to us,"" added Willey.

Bannon Speaks with Breitbart News Daily to Celebrate Show Anniversary	"On Wednesday's edition of Breitbart News Daily, SiriusXM host Alex Marlow introduced a unique surprise guest: Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon, the founding host of Breitbart News Daily, currently on leave from Breitbart to serve as chief executive officer of Donald Trump's presidential campaign.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""This is officially not an interview. This is our birthday,"" Bannon declared, referring to the one-year anniversary of Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM.LISTEN:Bannon said his vision for Breitbart News Daily was inspired by the comments section at Breitbart.com, which was part of the effort to make the site ""as reader-driven as possible.""He recalled testing the waters for a radio program with the same structure with the Breitbart weekend radio shows, and was pleased to discover ""the callers were so engaged, it's kind of that crowdsourcing, you know the algorithms of crowdsourcing, how much great information you can get if you just open up the floodgates.""""It just turned out that people got into it, so it was a concept really driven off the site that we provide the news, you provide the commentary,"" Bannon said. ""Because you know at Breitbart, on the site itself, we don't try to have a lot of opinion pieces. We really went to news. And the comments were so - of course they exploded. A small article would get 3,000 comments. I figured you could transfer that to radio, and it turned out after we initially started, it really exploded, so I think we're on to something.""Marlow said this approach demonstrates that ""our populism is not for show. It's not a business model thing, it's genuine. It's the real deal.""Bannon agreed, remembering how Andrew Breitbart would say ""hey, one day I hope the comments section is as smart and funny as I remember Ace of Spades had that great comment section, and you would just be laughing out loud at what the comments said.""""I think it is a true thing of populism, that if you really turn it over to the people - and if they engage, which they clearly [have],"" Bannon said. ""People keep saying, 'Oh, you know, the Tea Party people or the people that go to Sarah Palin events, the people that go to these grassroots events, are now the people that back Trump, right? They're morons, they're idiots, they don't know anything.' If you really listen to them, they know a lot. They're very funny and incredibly insightful, so I thought it was a bet we should take, and it turned out to be bigger than our expectations.""Of course, Marlow could not resist the temptation to ask Bannon about his current preoccupation, the 2016 presidential race, and if he had any inside scoops from the Trump campaign to offer.""If you think about it, a year ago when we started the broadcast, who would have ever thought we'd have gone through the year, collectively, together, both at the site and on the radio show, that we've gone through? I would just tell people, I think you're in a very historic moment, and I think that the next six days are going to be as action-packed and probably thrilling as has the last year, because the thing is totally unpredictable, and it's just truly something to live through,"" Bannon said.""I would tell everybody, obviously to vote, but to remember that this is a very historic moment, and I think you'll be talking about this one for a long time, in the future, for a long time to come,"" he emphasized. ""It just seems like there's something very important going on in this. And as you can tell, it's almost every day there's other twists and turns. Not only is it quite engaging, from the point of people who love politics, or love history, or just love current events, but it's also something that's quite thrilling.""Marlow asked Bannon, as a history buff, if there was any precedent for a ""sea change in the electorate"" comparable to the movement from Clinton to Trump over the past few days.""Clearly there's a lot of parallels, I think, to Andrew Jackson, to what happened during the rise of Andrew Jackson's populism,"" Bannon replied, also finding similarities to the fall of the Whigs and William Jennings Bryan's Populist movement. ""But no, I don't think we've seen anything like this in a long time,"" he continued. ""And what really amazes me still is how many pundits, and how many people that follow this day in and day out, don't really understand the kind of historic nature of what's going on, and how this has really been a sea change. You know, they don't have the honor that we have, Alex, not just to work at Breitbart and to see what's going on with the support that Breitbart's getting from the people, but really to listen to SiriusXM, the Patriot Channel and Breitbart News on the weekends and daily.""""I don't say that as a promotional tool,"" he added. ""I still, on the [SiriusXM] On Demand, try to catch as much of the show as possible - and not to skip to the guests, but to listen to the callers. You know, if you think about it, Alex, before I stepped away temporarily to take the job over at Trump, very much what has been implemented, or very much what was followed is really what the callers have said. If you've really listened to the callers over the last, what is it, 90 days, much of the insight or savvy, however you want to say it, really the callers speak to this every day - whether it's the debates or other things that are happening.""""I still think that most of the people in the Establishment don't realize how deep this movement is and how powerful it is,"" Bannon said. ""The best thing about going over and working with Mr. Trump on the campaign is actually getting out to the rallies every day, and seeing it now for the last 90 days, you really see that the passion of the people - whether it's in Maine, or Arizona, or Nevada, or last night in Wisconsin, or today in Florida - you really see how engaged people are in this entire process.""Bannon thought this heightened level of engagement signaled a profound change in politics, no matter the outcome of next week's election, although he remained confident that Trump would win.""I read some of these articles about this big civil war that's coming in the Republican Party, and it's pretty stunning to me people haven't seen this. It's been at this now for what, six years, really since 2010 with the Tea Party revolt,"" he observed.""I think it's the level of engagement. I think you can see it in the show. When people call up, they know what they're talking about. They're engaged, they know the details,"" Bannon said.He told the story of how Nigel Farage, formerly leader of the U.K. Independence Party, came to a Trump rally in Mississippi at the invitation of the governor, and came on stage with Trump and some other guests.""The next day I was catching 'Morning Joe,' and they had the correspondent, I think it was Nicholas Corasaniti from the New York Times,"" Bannon recalled. ""And he was sitting there, just kind of smug, smirking on 'Morning Joe,' and they were all laughing about how this thing was so bizarre. Why would they have a guy that nobody knew, and the guy actually said, I'll bet you 99% of the people - and there was like 15,000 people in this arena - that 99% of the people would not know who this guy was. And if you were there, and you saw it, 120% of the people knew who Nigel Farage was, right? Because people that are part of this movement, not only do they go to Breitbart and other sites - I mean, Nigel Farage is kind of a cult hero in this global populist movement.""""That probably explains the gulf between the mainstream media, and the arrogance of the elites in this country, versus what's truly going on,"" he said. ""Here you've got this arena, and not only do they have Nigel Farage, these people could give you a better understanding of Brexit, and knew about Brexit - following Breitbart and listening to Breitbart when you, and [SiriusXM producer Caroline Magyarits], and [Breitbart London Editor-in-Chief Raheem Kassam] did the show for a week from London, besides all the London office stuff we had - that people knew the details of Brexit and knew more about Brexit. The night of Brexit, when they won, you saw CNN and others had no earthly idea what was even going on, couldn't even pronounce the people's names, didn't know the issues.""""And yet, the little guys, the men and women in Mississippi, knew who Nigel Farage was and could give you quite a level of detail of UKIP and Brexit and the issues facing Europe,"" he continued. ""The elites, who really didn't understand it, didn't understand the issues, sitting there mocking them - this is another example of what idiots the Trump guys are, that they have somebody that clearly these rubes down in Mississippi don't know. I think that encapsulates still the dismissive attitude towards a lot that's going on, but it's quite powerful, and clearly we've got six days to go before this election, but I think regardless of the outcome there's been a sea change in American politics. This movement, as I keep saying, it's just at the top of the first inning.""Bannon also stressed that the movement is global, contrary to media attempts to portray it as entirely provincial - a natural mistake for elites who deliberately confuse border security and constructive nationalism with close-minded xenophobia.""People want more control of their country, and they're very proud of their countries. They want borders, they want sovereignty. It's not just a thing that's happening in any one geographic space. You can see it happening in Asia, you can see it happening in Europe, you can see it happening in the Middle East, and you're seeing it happen in the United States,"" he told Marlow.""People understand the issues, and they understand the interconnectivity to it. Like you said, Brexit, you go in there and it's amazing. You go, whether you're in Wisconsin or Maine or Mississippi, people know the details of it, and they know what drove that vote.""Bannon addressed the topic of polling and the ""hidden vote"" - the idea that Donald Trump will draw support on Election Day from people who are essentially invisible to pollsters because they've been checked out of the political process for several previous election cycles. Some have suggested Trump will benefit from a ""Brexit movement,"" similar to the unexpectedly strong support for the U.K. exiting from the European Union.""I think it's one thing to have to poll a referendum. It's different than having to poll an election between people,"" he pointed out. ""So I'm not sure they're exactly analogous, when you look at the polling aspect of it. But I think that the passion and the determination to make something happen is the same.""Bannon noted that his ""term of duty here ends on the evening of [November] the Eighth, so I look forward to getting back and being part of"" Breitbart News Daily.""It's our first anniversary, and hopefully our second anniversary of the show will be even bigger and have a bigger impact than it's had in its first year,"" he said. ""It's been a great run, and we owe SiriusXM and Dave Gorab and Liz [Aiello], and all the [SiriusXM] executives that helped pull this together, and of course Caroline Magyarits, and Miss Barrett, and all the production staff have just done such a great job, along with [Breitbart Senior West Coast Editor] Rebecca Mansour and all the Breitbart people."" ""It takes a lot to put the show on, particularly seven days a week, but you and Raheem and [Breitbart Washington Political Editor] Matt Boyle have done an extraordinary job,"" he told Marlow. ""I look forward to being a part of it again. It's really something I miss a lot. It's so much fun to start the day with an engaged citizenry that we do every day on Breitbart News. It's just a ton of fun, and I look forward to getting back.""Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.Listen to the complete audio of Bannon's interview above.SIGN UPOn Wednesday's edition of Breitbart News Daily, SiriusXM host Alex Marlow introduced a unique surprise guest: Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon, the founding host of Breitbart News Daily, currently on leave from Breitbart to serve as chief executive officer of Donald Trump's presidential campaign.""This is officially not an interview. This is our birthday,"" Bannon declared, referring to the one-year anniversary of Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM.Bannon said his vision for was inspired by the comments section at Breitbart.com, which was part of the effort to make the site ""as reader-driven as possible.""He recalled testing the waters for a radio program with the same structure with the Breitbart weekend radio shows, and was pleased to discover ""the callers were so engaged, it's kind of that crowdsourcing, you know the algorithms of crowdsourcing, how much great information you can get if you just open up the floodgates.""""It just turned out that people got into it, so it was a concept really driven off the site that we provide the news, you provide the commentary,"" Bannon said. ""Because you know at Breitbart, on the site itself, we don't try to have a lot of opinion pieces. We really went to news. And the comments were so - of course they exploded. A small article would get 3,000 comments. I figured you could transfer that to radio, and it turned out after we initially started, it really exploded, so I think we're on to something.""Marlow said this approach demonstrates that ""our populism is not for show. It's not a business model thing, it's genuine. It's the real deal.""Bannon agreed, remembering how Andrew Breitbart would say ""hey, one day I hope the comments section is as smart and funny as I remember Ace of Spades had that great comment section, and you would just be laughing out loud at what the comments said.""""I think it is a true thing of populism, that if you really turn it over to the people - and if they engage, which they clearly [have],"" Bannon said. ""People keep saying, 'Oh, you know, the Tea Party people or the people that go to Sarah Palin events, the people that go to these grassroots events, are now the people that back Trump, right? They're morons, they're idiots, they don't know anything.' If you really listen to them, they know a lot. They're very funny and incredibly insightful, so I thought it was a bet we should take, and it turned out to be bigger than our expectations.""Of course, Marlow could not resist the temptation to ask Bannon about his current preoccupation, the 2016 presidential race, and if he had any inside scoops from the Trump campaign to offer.""If you think about it, a year ago when we started the broadcast, who would have ever thought we'd have gone through the year, collectively, together, both at the site and on the radio show, that we've gone through? I would just tell people, I think you're in a very historic moment, and I think that the next six days are going to be as action-packed and probably thrilling as has the last year, because the thing is totally unpredictable, and it's just truly something to live through,"" Bannon said.""I would tell everybody, obviously to vote, but to remember that this is a very historic moment, and I think you'll be talking about this one for a long time, in the future, for a long time to come,"" he emphasized. ""It just seems like there's something very important going on in this. And as you can tell, it's almost every day there's other twists and turns. Not only is it quite engaging, from the point of people who love politics, or love history, or just love current events, but it's also something that's quite thrilling.""Marlow asked Bannon, as a history buff, if there was any precedent for a ""sea change in the electorate"" comparable to the movement from Clinton to Trump over the past few days.""Clearly there's a lot of parallels, I think, to Andrew Jackson, to what happened during the rise of Andrew Jackson's populism,"" Bannon replied, also finding similarities to the fall of the Whigs and William Jennings Bryan's Populist movement. ""But no, I don't think we've seen anything like this in a long time,"" he continued. ""And what really amazes me still is how many pundits, and how many people that follow this day in and day out, don't really understand the kind of historic nature of what's going on, and how this has really been a sea change. You know, they don't have the honor that we have, Alex, not just to work at Breitbart and to see what's going on with the support that Breitbart's getting from the people, but really to listen to SiriusXM, the Patriot Channel and Breitbart News on the weekends and daily.""""I don't say that as a promotional tool,"" he added. ""I still, on the [SiriusXM] On Demand, try to catch as much of the show as possible - and not to skip to the guests, but to listen to the callers. You know, if you think about it, Alex, before I stepped away temporarily to take the job over at Trump, very much what has been implemented, or very much what was followed is really what the callers have said.

But recently the artist has found a new muse: Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.The iconic Lovegrove Gallery and Gardens is showing the artist's enthusiastic support for Trump. Five large canvasses spelling out T.R.U.M.P. are prominently displayed on the roof and another sign sitting next to the two-lane road reads, ""Trump for President 2016."" In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, Lovegrove explained how the theft of several standard Trump campaign signs inspired the artistic display.The minute I could buy the [Trump campaign] signs, I bought them. And the minute we could legally put them out, they were stolen. Somebody had went to the headquarters and got one and I put it up on the roof and they stole that. So I decided to go bigger and better. I started with the one on the road and then I decided to paint the five important canvasses [T.R.U.M.P.]I was so upset, for one, I would never take a sign, it's against the law. I had never seen someone's signs taken before. I mean I'm not the only one it's happening all over and I decided, well, we'll just put up some surveillance and just go for it.I actually painted those in my studio in the middle of the night and I didn't have enough canvasses, so I actually painted over some of my paintings just so I had the canvass, I was so passionate about making sure they were seen.What's been wonderful all the honks -- did you just hear that honk -- all day long, you can tell the good honks and you can tell the other people but most of the response has just been fabulous.In fact, it's been good for business the minute I put those up people were pounding at our door, we were actually closed and we had to open up.

Riley argues Wednesday that given the internal dissatisfaction with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, the party should ""Bring Back the Smoke-Filled Room,"" and let insiders pick next time.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERRiley argues that in the year of the political outsider, Democrats benefited from a system that was rigged to prevent Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) from taking the nomination from Hillary Clinton. ""[S]uperdelegates,"" he says, ""helped the Democratic Party police the nomination process in a way that the Republican Party failed.""It is easy enough, though unconvincing, to point out that what Riley is advocating is fundamentally anti-democratic. Indeed, he sees that as the main advantage of the ""smoke-filled room"": the people sometimes make bad choices. There is a trade-off, he says, between an open nominating process and an effective one:...efforts to reduce corruption and further democratize the process have also weakened the influence of party leaders in ways that made coordination, accountability and party unity much more difficult ... the reality is that politics is about organization, and political insiders know how to organize, how to turn out the vote, and how to pick capable candidates who are less likely to polarize and more likely to win.There are plenty of questionable assumptions that go into Riley's analysis -- such as the anticipation that Trump will lose (the election isn't over yet), or that Clinton is, in fact, a more effective candidate than Sanders would have been. (As radical as he is, how many criminal investigations has he faced?)But even if we assume, for argument's sake, that Riley's argument has merit, there is one fundamental problem with which he fails to grapple: namely, that the Republican Party establishment is uniquely incompetent, divided, and out of touch.Donald Trump rose to the top of the field of 18 candidates for a variety of reasons, but one of the most important was that the establishment was torn between two candidates: former Florida Jeb Bush and his protege, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL).Bush represented a proven record of fundraising, and winning. He had been a successful governor, and speaks Spanish. But he was a Bush, in a country tired of Bushes.Rubio represented the future -- a Latino candidate who checked all the boxes on social and fiscal issues, and who had fought hard, if in vain, for immigration reform. But he was inexperienced, and it was not his turn.The Bush-Rubio divide prevented the establishment from settling on a candidate. The dysfunctional nature of the rift was highlighted by the fact that the two are both from the same state, and their ambitions still could not be reconciled.Moreover, both Bush and Rubio were soft on illegal immigration. Bush favored a position best described as ""amnesty,"" while Rubio had been burned by the Senate's ""Gang of Eight"" bill, which failed to separate legalization from border security.In other words, the party establishment took for granted an immigration policy to which much of rest of the party objected. Either candidate would have struggled to unite the party for that reason alone.Riley may be correct that a party establishment does have an important role to play in the nomination process. But it cannot function in isolation from the party base, nor can it guide voters if it cannot make up its own mind.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

The caller said he applied for a job but grew concerned after realizing the group supported only Democratic candidates.According to paperwork filed with the North Carolina Secretary of State, Community Outreach Group is governed by the leaders of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, which is based in Washington, D.C.But in an ad posted online--including on Craigslist and Indeed.com--Community Outreach group claimed to be ""hiring Outreach Workers to knock on doors and convince people to vote and vote for our endorsed candidates.""The post portrayed COG as a group working against tolls.The ad, which said workers would be paid $15 per hour to campaign against tolls, reads, ""We're not happy about the toll plans in Charlotte and we need your help to ensure this boondoggle is reversed.""However, when WBTV's investigation team visited COG's Charlotte office, it found the group was working to promote gender ideology by opposing North Carolina's bathroom privacy bill.Asked about its anti-tolls campaign, one of the group's staffers said:When we're up in Huntersville, yeah, we talk about the toll roads. We're also talking to folks about getting out the vote and that sort of thing. It all kind of depends on where we are that day and, kind of, what the messaging is that day. It's not exclusively tolls. When we're up in Huntersville, a lot of times it's toll stuff.Eventually, the staff member admitted the ""anti-toll"" group was actually part of Planned Parenthood.""We're part of, uh, I don't know how to describe it,"" one worker said. ""In-house vendor for Planned Parenthood,"" a second worker added.According to the news report, I-77 Business Plan, a group that is truly opposed to the toll lanes, said COG's ads were a ""deceitful manipulation of concerns.""When the investigation team contacted Planned Parenthood regarding the ad, COG removed it, but a spokesperson later said COG was canvassing for Planned Parenthood Action PAC North Carolina, which was also working with Aim Higher Now - a separate group - and together they work on many issues, including women's health, education, and tolls.In the days leading up to election day, Planned Parenthood Action Fund - the abortion giant's advocacy and political arm - says it has 1500 paid staffers and 3,500 volunteers knocking on doors in New Hampshire, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Nevada, and North Carolina, reports CBS News. The group says it will hold 250 ""Pink Out the Vote"" events as well.Show us how you #PinkOutTheVote. Mention us with a picture of you getting out the vote, or with your ""I Voted"" stickers! pic.twitter.com/aDgnGehpjO-- Planned Parenthood (@PPact) November 1, 2016The report continues that Planned Parenthood is utilizing its ""voter propensity model,"" which essentially targets the type of people most likely to vote for Clinton and other Democrats: minorities (32 percent), under-35 voters (26 percent), and females (55 percent).Planned Parenthood has spent upward of $30 million this election cycle to support Democrats, most of whom are abortion advocates. Clinton herself has vowed to repeal the Hyde Amendment, a longstanding federal law that prohibits taxpayer funding of abortion, so that more low-income women can have abortions.But Planned Parenthood isn't the only group concerned about abortion getting out the vote. The pro-life Susan B. Anthony List/Women Speak Out PAC field team has been canvassing in Ohio, North Carolina, Florida, and Missouri. The group has been reaching out to pro-life voters who are more likely to stay home on Election Day, as well as to some Democrats and Hispanics who are inclined to be pro-life.Our #TuesdayMotivation is our dedicated field team of #ProLife canvassers who knocked on their 1,000,000th door this week! #GOTV pic.twitter.com/dZ34sob8Yp-- Susan B Anthony List (@SBAList) November 1, 2016SBA List says more than 600 canvassers are ""exposing the extremism of Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Senate candidates.""""At this point, we've knocked 890,000 doors and on track to hit a million next week!"" the group says.Recent polls show the pro-life movement has made significant headway in exposing the goals of the abortion industry. Last week, a new Politico poll revealed two-thirds of voters want to retain a ban on taxpayer funding of abortion under Medicaid. The survey lends further support to a recent Marist poll, which found that 62 percent of Americans oppose taxpayer funding of abortion, including 63 percent of women, 45 percent of those who say they are ""pro-choice"" and 44 percent of Democrats.Our investigation started after a man called our tip line with concerns about the organization, Community Outreach Group [COG].

Trump is campaigning throughout the state of Florida, with stops in Miami, Orlando, and Pensacola. He will continue his sweep through the Sunshine State on Thursday morning, with a stop in Jacksonville, before heading back to another battleground state, North Carolina.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAt every stop, Trump draws cheers and chants by mentioning Hillary Clinton's email scandal. But the core of his message remains the same as it was before the FBI announced that he was re-opening its investigation into Hillary Clinton last week: Trump is laser-focused on Obamacare.That is because there is nothing partisan about premium increases.In Philadelphia, where Trump delivered a policy speech on repealing and replacing Obamacare on Tuesday, the lowest-cost ""silver"" plan will be 51% more expensive in 2017. There is nothing Republican or Democratic about that kind of increase. As Trump noted, the rising cost is forcing many families to choose between paying rent, or paying for health insurance.And while Hillary Clinton is running on a promise to tinker with the Obamacare system, Trump is promising to remove it entirely -- a credible promise, since his party will certainly help him.By contrast, the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server is still largely viewed through a partisan lens. Those who already see Hillary Clinton as untrustworthy see the latest developments as confirmation of their judgments.But the limited polling data that have emerged since last Friday's announcement suggests that the FBI investigation has not moved too many Democrats away from their candidate. When Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said last year that he was ""sick and tired"" of hearing about Hillary Clinton's emails, he was speaking for many on the left, who see the issue, rightly or wrongly, as a partisan one.Obamacare is different, because it is simply about dollars and sense. So while Trump talks about every new revelation from the FBI, and every new Wikileaks email, those are messages aimed at his base. The core message of every speech remains what it was last week, prior to the FBI news: Obamacare, Obamacare, Obamacare. That is the only way Trump can reach beyond partisan suspicions and connect with voters in battleground states.That is the best way for him to expand the electoral map in the final week, because Democrats who may detest everything else about Trump may like Obamacare even less.Joel B.

It was unclear how many lashes he received.Last month, Saudi authorities executed Prince Turki bin Saud al-Kabir in a highly unusual case involving one of the thousands of members of the royal family.He was condemned to death for shooting dead Adel al-Mahemid, a Saudi, during a brawl.Most people put to death in Saudi Arabia are beheaded with a sword.Saudi Arabia is one of the world's most prolific executioners and has a strict Islamic legal code under which murder, drug trafficking, armed robbery, rape and apostasy are all punishable by death.Rights groups have also raised concerns about flogging sentences including those handed to Saudi rights activist Raif Badawi, convicted of insulting Islam, and Palestinian poet Ashraf Fayad, convicted of apostasy.Arrested in 2012, Badawi is serving a 10-year jail sentence and has received 50 lashes of a 1,000-lash sentence that caused international outrage.A Saudi court in February commuted a death sentence against Fayad to eight years in jail, but maintained a punishment of 800 lashes in sessions of 50.SIGN UPRIYADH (AFP) -

She thought he was ""the whole package"" at the time, and they soon married. They moved to Fort Pierce, Florida, where Salman quickly became pregnant. She said it was while shopping for baby clothes that Mateen beat her for the first time.Mateen alleged that he began having serious anger issues-that ""he would [start] biting his lips and clinching his fists"" and would use a code word to call her into line if he got angry with her in public. That word was ""shar,"" which is Arabic for ""whore.""Salman indicated that she was scared to stay with Mateen, but also scared to leave, as he convinced her he would get custody of their son if she tried to break things off.Mateen took his wife and son to Disney World in April 2015. ""Law enforcement officials suspect Mr. Mateen went there to see if it would be a good target."" They also believe he probably ""hinted at his intentions to conduct an attack."" Salman's lawyer will not allow her to speak to these things.The Times points out that she also went with her husband to buy ammunition, something that did not seem strange to her since her husband was a licensed, armed security guard.On June 11, Salman said she was planning a family night, but Mateen came home from work around 3:00 p.m. and soon departed. She said she did not know where he went, but it is now clear he drove approximately two hours to Orlando and attacked the Pulse nightclub. She was awakened at 4:00 a.m. when Mateen's mother called to look for him. Shortly thereafter, she received a text from Mateen, which said, ""Did you see what happened?""She texted that she had not seen. He responded with, ""I love you babe,"" and she never heard from him again.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of ""Bullets with AWR Hawkins,"" a Breitbart News podcast.
