This means that winters in Europe and North America have been getting colder and should continue to do so.Confidently asserting that ""Arctic temperature increases are an inevitable aspect of anthropogenic climate change,"" they propose ""a perspective that rejects simple cause-and-effect pathways and notes diagnostic challenges in interpreting atmospheric dynamics.""Attentive followers of climate change literature will no doubt recall that several months ago another group of scientists documented that temperatures in the Antarctic Peninsula had been falling steadily for the last 18 years at the rate of nearly one degree Fahrenheit per decade, reversing earlier warming trends and throwing climate change alarmists into a tailspin.Writing in the journal Nature, the scientists debunked one of the most touted cases of anthropogenic (man-made) global warming in the last 50 years, noting that it was due to natural climate shifts after all.Many of the fears associated with the rapid warming of the Peninsula, such as the regional retreat of glaciers and disintegration of floating ice shelves, the authors wrote in their article ""Climate science: Cooling in the Antarctic,"" were not in fact due to ""drivers of global temperature change"" as previously believed. They were instead caused by a particular microclimate associated with ""extreme natural internal variability of the regional atmospheric circulation.""Nature's editor noted that although the Antarctic Peninsula is ""frequently presented as a case study of rapid warming,"" scientists John Turner and colleagues have now shown that warming trends have abated and ""for the early years of the twenty-first century the peninsula has in the main been cooling.""The climate community was wise to hedge its bets and phase out the expression ""global warming,"" replacing it with the more ambiguous ""climate change.""After all, whether cooler, warmer, wetter, drier or windier, one thing the climate can be counted on to do is change.Follow Thomas D.

""She in no way stands for women or supports women. Now she will verbally say she does but actions speak louder than words.""Flowers made the remark during an hour-long interview recorded for this reporter's talk radio program, ""Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,"" broadcast on New York's AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM. Some sections of the interview played last week while others will air this coming Sunday.Listen to the interview here:Flowers said of Hillary Clinton's relationship with her husband:She has been the enabler. And I know that the word enabler has been used in reference to enabling drug addicts and alcoholics and that sort of thing. But I actually used that term some time back that she was the enabler that really allowed him to go on and do what he did in a variety of forms to women. She never held him responsible. It was always the fault of the women. Even in the case of Monica Lewinsky.Flowers never sought to go public. She was forced into the spotlight against her will when former Clinton insider Larry Nichols, who claimed he was improperly dismissed by Clinton from a state job, mentioned Flowers in court documents. In a lawsuit, Nichols alleged that Clinton diverted state funds to engage in extramarital affairs with five women. He named Flowers and four others, including former Miss America Elizabeth Ward Gracen and former Miss Arkansas Lencola Sullivan.Nichols would later drop his lawsuit, but the charges helped form the basis of tabloid stories alleging that Clinton had extramarital affairs, including with Flowers.Three days after Star magazine mentioned Flowers as Clinton's alleged mistress, Bill and Hillary Clinton appeared side by side on 60 Minutes in January 1992, where Bill denied a relationship with Flowers.To protect her reputation, Flowers held a press conference the next day where she played excerpts from tape recordings she had made of private phone calls with Clinton. In a deposition in 1998, Bill Clinton admitted he had a sexual encounter with Flowers.Aaron Klein is Breitbart's Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

But they also repeatedly acknowledged there are limits to what they can control, and they recognize they face legitimate challenges from cyber intrusions to the myriad adjacent parts that go into an election, including online registration records and publicizing vote tallies.While any manipulation of a state's official election results is seen as unlikely, there's little denying that an Internet disruption or hack could cause significant confusion and chaos on Election Day, a dark conclusion to an ugly election plagued by accusations of Russian cyber espionage and evidence-less allegations of vote tampering and rigging.Just last week, hackers temporarily froze a sizable chunk of the internet, a worst-case scenario that would cause serious problems around the country if duplicated on Nov. 8 -- the day more than 100 million Americans are going to the polls.Federal agencies have also been scrambling since the summer to help state and local officials prepare emergency plans for the 2016 election, including via an added emphasis on cyber risks. Breaches earlier this summer to the voter registration databases in Illinois and Arizona prompted the FBI to issue a nationwide alert to the other states. The Homeland Security Department has also gotten requests from 42 states seeking help shoring up their cyber hygiene practices and assessing their online vulnerabilities.Read the rest here.  SIGN UP"

She is a woman without accomplishment. ""I sponsored or co-sponsored 400 bills."" Oh really? These were bills to rename bridges and so forth. And the things she has accomplished have been like the destabilization of North Africa, causing refugees to flood into Italy... The woman is a disaster!Having already voted once for Jill Stein of the Green Party, the 69-year-old professor of humanities at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia asserts she's already voted for a woman for president, so it's no big deal. Paglia's view of feminism is light years away from the likes of Clinton and Madeleine Albright, who told young women there would be a ""special place in hell"" for them if they chose Bernie Sanders over Clinton.""My philosophy of feminism, I call street-smart Amazon feminism,"" Paglia explains. ""I'm from an immigrant family. The way I was brought up was: the world is a dangerous place; you must learn to defend yourself. You can't be a fool. You have to stay alert.""Nowadays, however, the author of soon-to-be-published Free Women, Free Men: Sex, Gender, Feminism finds young girls are protected and coddled as they're taught to become ""helpless victims"" when life becomes challenging.""We are rocketing backwards here to the Victorian period with this belief that women are not capable of making decisions on their own,"" she says. ""This is not feminism -- which is to achieve independent thought and action. There will never be equality of the sexes if we think that women are so handicapped they can't look after themselves.""And, of course, that is the image of women conveyed by Clinton and her feminist colleagues. At a recent campaign stop in Haverford, Pennsylvania, Clinton - with daughter Chelsea in tow - told an audience of mostly women and young people that women need taxpayer-funded assistance, courtesy of the government, from cradle to grave in order to survive.""We have to look at the whole life cycle,"" Clinton said, echoing the ""Life of Julia"" presented by Barack Obama's re-election campaign in 2012. That campaign initiative demonstrated how a fictitious woman named ""Julia"" fared better throughout her entire life because of big government policies promoted by Obama over those of his then opponent, Republican Mitt Romney.""It should not be so hard to be a young parent,"" Clinton said in Haverford. ""And it should not be so hard on the other end of the age spectrum to take care of your loved one.""""People say, 'I can't get the help I need for myself, my spouse, my child,'"" she continued. ""There's just not enough help. Women tell me these stories about how hard it is. They tell me not only do they have no paid family leave, they have no earned sick days.""But, for Paglia - who is pro-prostitutes and pro-porn - women should not be expecting special treatment. The feminists she reveres urged women to be tough and fight their own battles with the intention of winning them. Her favorite live feminist, according to Hill, is Germaine Greer, while Amelia Earhart and Katharine Hepburn are at the top of her list of those feminists no longer with us.""I do not believe in quotas of any kind,"" she asserts. ""If Hillary wins, nothing will change. She knows the bureaucracy, all the offices of government and that's what she likes to do, sit behind the scenes and manipulate the levers of power.""A Trump victory, however, says Paglia, will be ""an amazing moment of change because it would destroy the power structure of the Republican party, the power structure of the Democratic party and destroy the power of the media.""""It would be an incredible release of energy... at a moment of international tension and crisis,"" she adds.It's an outrage how she's played the gender card. She is a woman without accomplishment. ""I sponsored or co-sponsored 400 bills."" Oh really? These were bills to rename bridges and so forth.

11	http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/28/dicaprios-before-the-flood-drowns-in-sea-of-green-hypocrisy/	DiCaprio’s ‘Before The Flood’ Drowns in Sea of Green Hypocrisy	"Leonardo DiCaprio claims his new film will illustrate the dangers of climate change.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBefore the Flood is a new ""documentary"" that chronicles DiCaprio's carbon-spewing journey across the planet, where he relies on natural disasters to prove that global warming is occurring and catastrophic.The Oscar-winning actor speaks to scientists, politicians, and academics who provide dramatic soundbites about man-made global warming, but he fails to include a single quote from the thousands of scientists, politicians, and academics who vehemently disagree with these soundbites.The United Nations has made frequent use of the Hollywood star in an effort to demonize fossil fuel use. The result? DiCaprio's new film is something the actor claims will ""scare the hell"" out of people.But the only thing more likely to scare audiences is the aw-shucks, privileged dilettante who says he's just a ""normal guy"" like everybody else. In reality, DiCaprio is a party boy who loves his carbon-emitting playthings as much as he enjoys preaching the global warming gospel. It's a skill he acquired from Al Gore, after a 1998 visit to the White House. Shortly thereafter, he formed the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation to address environmental concerns.The documentary comes at a curious time, since DiCaprio and his foundation are caught up in a scandal that has launched calls for him to step down from his post as a ""U.N. Messenger of Peace with a special focus on climate change.""His foundation has allegedly received millions of embezzled dollars from Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund--called 1Malaysia Development Berhad (or 1MDB)--as payment for his starring in and producing The Wolf of Wall Street, a film about an unscrupulous stockbroker. DiCaprio now says he will return the money, but that may prove difficult given that his ""donor-advised fund"" is attached to the billion-dollar California Community Foundation.DiCaprio's lavish lifestyle hasn't stopped the media from praising his work as a climate change demagogue. Editors and reporters often quote DiCaprio for saying that the fossil fuel industry should be ""taxed out of existence""--an ironic suggestion since fossil fuels have enabled him to zip around the world to attend environmentally themed parties or lecture world leaders to address the climate crisis.DiCaprio's antipathy toward fossil fuels prompted ABC's Good Morning America to call him an ""incredibly committed"" man who is ""not just talking the talk"" but is actually ""advocating bold changes to tackle climate change."" The well-paid staff at ABC may not have considered that multimillionaire DiCaprio can afford any carbon tax imposed on him. Unfortunately, most Americans are barely making ends meet in the Obama economy.The hypocrisy is indeed entertaining, however, and examples abound of DiCaprio's carbon profligacy. Three months before standing in front of the U.N. and lamenting, ""If we do not act together, we will surely perish,"" DiCaprio took a private jet to Brazil. That flight was needed so the actor could borrow an Abu Dhabi billionaire's 470-foot yacht to throw an extravagant party.When DiCaprio picked up an environmental award in New York City last May, he was able to do so by taking a private jet from Cannes, then flying straight back to France on another private jet for a model-packed fundraiser the next evening. That's an 8,000-mile carbon footprint.DiCaprio has a track record of jet-set jaunts, though. In 2013, DiCaprio and fellow actor Jonah Hill flew from Sydney, Australia, to Las Vegas on a chartered 747 to celebrate New Year's Eve at two separate parties. A private jet's carbon emissions are 130 times greater than those of a commercial aircraft.Some high-powered anti-fossil fuel groups, including the Sierra Club, have indeed criticized DiCaprio for not ""walking the talk"" and for setting a bad example of environmentalism.Those complaints are likely a small matter since DiCaprio can seek solace in two adjoining properties in Hollywood, as well as a six-bedroom mansion in Palm Springs, Calif., two apartments in Battery Park City, N.Y., and an apartment in Greenwich Village. In 2014, he sold his beachfront estate in Malibu.DiCaprio admits his ""footprint is probably bigger than most"" and in his documentary he includes footage of insults he's received on that point. But the overall acting in Before the Flood is surprisingly wooden. When we see DiCaprio meeting with President Obama, the interview comes across as stilted and scripted. DiCaprio appears to fawn over the president, and the glowing admiration feels uncomfortable. That sort of emoting may work in films, but not in documentaries.But back to the oh-so-high life. DiCaprio now owns a personal party yacht and has rented another, helpful distractions from his work sitting on the boards of various green groups such as the World Wildlife Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council, Pristine Seas, and other organizations. The yacht life functions as an amusing counterpoint to the worldview expressed in DiCaprio's previous documentary, The 11th Hour, in which he demanded the world switch to 100 percent renewable energy.Arguably the most notable thing DiCaprio ever said was, ""I am not a scientist, but I don't need to be. Because the world's scientific community has spoken, and they have given us our prognosis: if we do not act together, we will surely perish.""At the close of Before the Flood, DiCaprio addresses the U.N. and says, ""The world is now watching. You are the last best hope of Earth, or you and all of the things we cherish, are history."" One wonders if the greatest hope would be DiCaprio and his celebrity ilk changing their self-indulgent behavior to avert an endlessly touted two degrees of disastrous warming.It should be noted the mainstream media is already heaping praise on DiCaprio's new documentary despite its many shortfalls, calling it visionary and chilling.Yes, the film demonstrates stunning photography courtesy of Antonio Rossi (a documentary pro). But it gets drowned out by the film's preachy writing, courtesy of Mark Monroe (The Cove, Chasing Ice). The entire modus operandi of the documentary is to scare you witless. Al Gore must be pleased with his pupil. Not short on money, the film employs spiffy animation, with one showing a pre-polluted Earth vs. a post-polluted Earth, as seen from space. The structure of Before the Flood is both repetitive and rehearsed. First, dole out misleading data with disturbing imagery. Then have an alarmist say something dramatic about the data.

23	http://www.breitbart.com/obamacare/2016/10/28/blue-state-blues-obamacare-failure-not-exactly-october-surprise/	Blue State Blues: Obamacare’s Failure Is Not Exactly an October ‘Surprise’	"The October surprises are in.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe Access Hollywood tape knocked Donald Trump off his game for two weeks. James O'Keefe and Project Veritas exposed the thuggery and lawlessness at the core of the Hillary Clinton campaign. And Wikileaks provides daily evidence of the Clintons' pathological corruption.But the biggest shock of all has been the dramatic increase in Obamacare premiums.I use the word ""shock,"" and not ""surprise,"" because the sharp rise in prices -- double- and triple-digit percentages, in many states -- was predictable.Republicans had been warning about it since 2009. Young, healthy people will refuse to overpay for insurance they do not need. The remaining patients will be older and sicker. Prices will have to rise. More patients will drop coverage. And then, collapse.Thanks to the provisions of the Obamacare statute itself, many of the law's most obnoxious deadlines happen in the fall, right in the middle of election season.The White House tried to defer as many of the mandates as it could, effectively re-writing the law and violating the Constitution for purely political reasons.But the deadlines could not be deferred forever. And Hillary Clinton can do nothing about them.If Donald Trump manages to pull off an upset victory in November, it will be because of Obamacare.He mentioned it at every single campaign stop on Wednesday (though, typically, the media focused on his comments about Newt Gingrich and Megyn Kelly, who evidently are more newsworthy than the ongoing destruction of the American health care system). He will doubtless slam Obamacare every day until Election Day.Most analysis of elections is speculative at best. There are millions of variables, and only one data point (win/lose). But if you had to choose one factor to describe recent American political fortunes, you could do worse than choosing Obamacare.It fueled the Tea Party revolt of 2010, after Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) told Congress to pass it so America could found out what was in it.It also propelled Republicans to victory in the 2014 midterm elections. When Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) tried to block Obamacare from taking effect in 2013, setting off a confrontation with the White House and a shutdown of the federal government, analysis predicted a disaster for the GOP in the midterms. Instead, voters gave Republicans a majority, hoping they would use it to finish what Cruz had started.In 2012, Obamacare was also a factor -- in Mitt Romney's loss, after Republican voters deferred to the wisdom of the party establishment and nominated a candidate whose opposition to Obamacare had zero credibility.(In his official gubernatorial portrait, which was unveiled at the Massachusetts State House during the 2012 campaign, Romney made sure his health law was depicted on the desk.)Now, in 2016, Obamacare's premium increases may propel voters to the polls to punish the party that bears sole ownership of the policy.But there are other reasons Obamacare is such a potent factor.It is a reminder, for example, of how brazenly President Obama lied to the American people, promising them that they would save money -- and that they could keep their insurance plans and their doctors.Obamacare also corrupted every branch of the federal government: the legislature, which passed the law through the Senate on a plain majority vote, thanks to a budget ""reconciliation"" trick; the judiciary, which agreed that the individual mandate was unconstitutional but rewrote the penalty as a ""tax""; and the executive, which not only overstepped its authority but also botched the launch of healthcare.gov.The law also destroyed public trust in government. When Democrat operative Robert Creamer, sitting in federal prison, began working on the strategy for passing ""universal health care,"" he conceived it as the first of a series of radical changes that Democrats could enact.Once the public had become used to that kind of systemic overhaul, it would resist each new change -- immigration, gun rights -- less.The opposite happened: the public rejected Obamacare, and rejects it still.Barack Obama's unique achievement -- if it can be called that -- was to stick with Creamer's plan anyway, and to attempt by executive fiat what the left had once hoped to do through popular consent.Only the nation's first black president could have done something so audacious, and survived the political consequences.Now Hillary Clinton is running on a promise to ""fix"" Obamacare.That is the essence of the choice the voters face: whether to accept a failing status quo, with feeble promises for minor reforms; or to risk abrupt interventions by an untested outsider.Before the Obamacare premium spikes, one of those choices had looked much more likely.But now, Trump is still in the race, thanks to the October-suprise-that-wasn't.Joel B.

24	http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/27/gay-politics-overseas-obama-clinton/	President Obama, Hillary Clinton, Push Gay Rights Fights Overseas	"Some gay activists overseas are urging President Barack Obama to back off his aggressive push for American-style global gay rights, which has made their cause more difficult in their countries, and, in some cases, even led to increased violence.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERA report by the Associated Press says the president is facing new obstacles as he pushes other countries to sideline their family cultures in favor of greater social respect for gays and homosexuality, not just government tolerance or disinterest. That policy was implemented and pushed by Hillary Clinton when she was working as Secretary of State.The U.S. has deployed its diplomats and spent tens of millions of dollars to try to block anti-gay laws, punish countries that enacted them, and tie financial assistance to respect for LGBT rights. It was a mission animated in part by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's declaration that ""gay rights are human rights.""Yet the U.S. encountered occasional backlash, including from some rights groups that said public pressure by the West made things worse.Even where special legal protections for gays were enacted to some extent, ""in Latin America, those changes have been accompanied by increasing violence against LGBT people,"" the report continues, noting that, in Gambia, the United States' ""decision to revoke the country's preferential trade status following an LGBT crackdown"" only escalated anti-gay sentiment.In February of 2014, President Yahya Jammeh of Gambia referred to homosexuals as ""vermin,"" and likened them to ""malaria-causing mosquitoes."" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called the comments ""unacceptable"" and called upon the international community to denounce the leader's statements.Nevertheless, Obama's demand that other countries embrace his radical LGBT agenda came to a head in 2015 in Kenya, where the country's leaders warned the American president not to bring his ""gay agenda"" with him, or else ""we shall tell him to shut up and go home.""According to AP:Warned in no uncertain terms ahead of his visits to keep quiet about gay rights, Obama called for equal legal treatment for gays while standing next to President Uhuru Kenyatta, who brushed it off and insisted it was ""not really an issue.""Bisi Alimi, a Nigerian gay rights activist, said that advocacy was critical to helping dissolve what for many Africans has been a persuasive argument against gay rights: that the U.S. and other rich nations are engaging in paternalism and cultural colonialism.""We should not forget that Obama's father is Kenyan,"" Alimi said by phone from London, where he fled after being physically attacked in Nigeria. ""There was no better place for him to say that than in a place where his nationality wouldn't be questioned, where he wouldn't be seen as a Westerner telling us how to live our lives.""In Uganda, the Obama administration's decision to revoke visas for Ugandan officials as well as aid to the country in retaliation for its ""Kill the Gays"" legislation, eventually gave gay rights opponents the ammunition to assert Washington, D.C. was dictating to their country.A diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks even demonstrated that LGBT activists in Uganda demanded that U.S. diplomats use ""quiet diplomacy - not public statements"" to encourage the gay rights agenda, says AP.As secretary of state, Democrat presidential candidate Clinton forced the issue of gay rights in 2011 in her speech to the U.N. in which she said, ""gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights."" The speech was meant to dovetail with one in Beijing in 1995 when, as First Lady of the United States, she equated human rights with women's rights.""I never expected these issues could be elevated so fast and at such a high level,"" said Mira Patel, a former State Department adviser who now works on Clinton's campaign.On Wednesday national security adviser Susan Rice again attempted a favorite scheme by the Obama administration: threatening to block U.S. funds to entities that won't conform to his ideology. Obama has used the same strong-arm tactic with states that refuse to enact his ""transgender bathroom"" policy and those that have passed laws eliminating abortion business Planned Parenthood's funding.Rice announced the United States has issued a new rule that bars U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) contracts from being awarded to any clinics, food programs, or shelters that refuse services to gays or transgenders.However, Rice admits the situation is tricky.""What we don't want to do to the extent we can avoid it is expose individuals who aren't wanting to be exposed and to put individuals at risk,"" she reportedly said.Obama, aided by an activist judiciary and a narrative that equates LGBT ""rights"" with the civil rights of black Americans, has achieved same-sex marriage in the United States and is now pressing for government-backed injection of the gender ideology into Americans' K-12 schools and everyday lives.The U.S. has deployed its diplomats and spent tens of millions of dollars to try to block anti-gay laws, punish countries that enacted them, and tie financial assistance to respect for LGBT rights. It was a mission animated in part by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's declaration that ""gay rights are human rights.""
Yet the U.S. encountered occasional backlash, including from some rights groups that said public pressure by the West made things worse.Warned in no uncertain terms ahead of his visits to keep quiet about gay rights, Obama called for equal legal treatment for gays while standing next to President Uhuru Kenyatta, who brushed it off and insisted it was ""not really an issue.""
Bisi Alimi, a Nigerian gay rights activist, said that advocacy was critical to helping dissolve what for many Africans has been a persuasive argument against gay rights: that the U.S. and other rich nations are engaging in paternalism and cultural colonialism.
""We should not forget that Obama's father is Kenyan,"" Alimi said by phone from London, where he fled after being physically attacked in Nigeria. ""There was no better place for him to say that than in a place where his nationality wouldn't be questioned, where he wouldn't be seen as a Westerner telling us how to live our lives.""SIGN UP"

That wasn't all: The car owner also found a letter of apology as well as money to replace the gas the thief used sitting inside the missing auto.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERPortland resident Erin Hatzi discovered her red Subaru had been stolen on the night of October 25. Police told her that surveillance video showed an unknown person getting into the vehicle and then sitting there alone for several minutes before driving off.""We were really confused because it didn't seem like the normal actions of a car thief,"" the car owner told Portland's NBC affiliate. ""You wouldn't think they'd sit there in idle in the owner's driveway for two or three minutes.""After reporting her car stolen, Hatzi was shocked when a woman came driving up in the very ""stolen"" car she had just reported to police and left behind an apology note and some extra gas money.It turns out that there really wasn't any car theft at all, but instead, it was all a big misunderstanding.Hatzi posted the contents of the note to Facebook as she laughed about the whole incident.""Hello, So sorry I stole your car,"" the note began. ""I sent my friend with my key to pick up my red Subaru at 7802 SE Woodstock and she came back with your car. I did not see the car until this morning and I said, 'That is not my car.' There is some cash for gas and I more than apologize for the shock and upset this must have caused you... So so sorry for this mistake.""As it happens, some older Subaru models have ignition keys that sometimes work in any number of other Subaru vehicles. The car the ""thief"" was looking for was sitting a block away the entire time.""It's insane,"" Hatzi told the media. ""It's like a bad sitcom that nobody would ever buy the story because it's stupid and it makes no sense. But it happened.""In the end, everyone parted as friends.Police said no charges will be filed.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.SIGN UP"

Meanwhile, Jill McCabe -- who has not only never run for office before but has little history of party activism in Virginia -- has received two extremely large donations amounting to over over $700,000 -- more than double what her predecessor vying for the seat raised.So, to recap, the wife of the G-man responsible for investigating Hillary Clinton's email scandal was the lucky recipient of over $700,000 in donations for her first-time political campaign from a man intimately connected to Bill and Hillary Clinton. And all these donations came prior to the decision by the FBI not to recommend Hillary Clinton's prosecution for breaking national security laws by storing classified material on an un-secure email server hidden in her home.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.SIGN UP

And you've got to do what you do with any salad; grab a rifle and pick through all the leaves and green stuff to see if there's any meat in there. Somewhere hidden under all this leafy green, there's meaty gold.The camera then zooms in on three Arby's sandwiches sitting on a table in the middle of the woods.There are four other Arby's hunting commercials that will run as well, one of which talks about the ""memories"" that are formed in the pursuit of meats, be that pursuit ""in the woods or on a sandwich.""
