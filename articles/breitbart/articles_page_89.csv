While there are already some important cases scheduled for argument, one case not yet on the calendar--a Second Amendment case--highlights more than any other the decades-long impact that November's election will have on the Constitution and the nation.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe Supreme Court is currently paralyzed for conservatives, and it's the cases that are not yet scheduled that involve some of the biggest issues facing the nation right now.Of those, the biggest by far is Tyler v. Hillsdale County Sheriff's Department, in which the Court may overrule its historic case District of Columbia v. Heller, which held that the Second Amendment is an individual right.The Court will decide sometime this winter whether to take Tyler. In the meantime, the Court has filled 29 of its roughly 75 oral argument slots for the annual term.The justices will consider at least one religious liberty case. Many states in the late 1800s adopted Blaine Amendments, which were originally intended to limit Roman Catholic schooling, but which have grown and morphed in modern secular America to ban all taxpayer funds from supporting faith-based work. In Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia v. Pauley, the Court will decide whether Blaine Amendments violate First Amendment religious liberties.In Lee v. Tam, the Supreme Court will decide whether the federal law authorizing the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) to deny trademark (""TM"") protection for content that PTO decides ""disparage[s] ... persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols, or bring them into contempt, or disrepute"" violates First Amendment free speech rights. The decision in that case will decide, for example, whether Pamela Geller's anti-Jihadi ads can receive protection recognized by law.When a foreign country takes someone's property in violation of international law, the Court will decide what standard has to be met under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) before a U.S. federal court can rule on the merits of the case.Regarding the controversial National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the justices will determine in National Labor Relations Board v. SW General when federal law prevents a person who has not been confirmed by the Senate from exercising the powers of that office.In Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Board of Elections, the Court will tackle controversial issues regarding the role of race when lawmakers draw legislative districting lines.In Jennings v. Rodriguez, the Court will consider whether aliens seeking admission in the United States who are also criminals--or even terrorists--are nonetheless entitled to bond hearings and the possibility of being set free into the American population.Many controversial cases on other issues--including family and transgender questions--are expected before the Court this term, though it's not certain which issues will make it to the High Court this year.With the current ideological split on the Court, it is a foregone conclusion that whether Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton wins the White House will determine the outcome of many of these issues, not just for this year at the Supreme Court but for many years to come.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

And September comes on the heels of August, which broke the previous August's record by nearly 100,000 background checks.Breitbart News previously reported that the record background check streak began in May 2015, when more background checks were conducted than had been conducted in any May on record. The same thing happened in June 2015, July 2015, August 2015, and so on. Then, in 2016, May broke the May 2015 record, June broke the June 2015 record, and so on.It is important to remember that the number of background checks conducted in a single month is not an exact indicator of the number of guns sold, and this is because background checks are conducted on the buyer rather than the number of guns purchased by the buyer. This means the 1,992,219 background checks conducted in September may actually represent nearly four million guns sold (if every buyer purchases two guns). And if every buyer purchased three guns, it means 1,992,219 checks equals nearly six million guns sold.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

He was born in Bangladesh and was living in Maryland.Since 2001, law-enforcement officials have arrested more than 101 people named for Islam's reputed prophet, Muhammad. Many other Islamic immigrants, converts and citizens have launched deadly attacks against Americans in Orlando, Florida, in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in San Bernardino, California, in Fort Hood, Texas, and in other places.In 2015, Das began to prepare a murder attempt of a U.S. service member living in Hyattsville, Maryland. When he and a confidential FBI source drove to the target's house on October 3, Das was arrested as he tried to remove the weapons from the car's trunk.Das repeatedly expressed his determination to comply with Islam's doctrinaire call for war against non-believers, showed his support for the Islamic States in Syria, and expressed his belief in orthodox Islam's offer of paradise in exchange for murder. According to the Baltimore Sun,Das used social media last year to express his support for ISIS, prosecutors said, ""including support for terrorist attacks in Paris, France, and San Bernardino, California.""Das tweeted the name and hometown of the service member, prosecutors said, and said the service member ""aspires to kill Muslims.""...Das tweeted a picture of an AK-47 assault rifle, prosecutors said, and wrote, ""This is more than just a gun. This is a ticket to Jannah"" -- a reference, prosecutors said, to ""the Islamic concept of paradise.""On Twitter, Das also expressed envy of people ""slaying kuffar"" -- killing nonbelievers -- and dying as religious martyrs, prosecutors said...During a meeting [with the confidential FBI source] on Sept. 11, prosecutors said, ""Das confirmed that he was committed '100 percent' to conducting an attack.""""'That's like my goal in life,'"" he told the source, prosecutors said. And on Friday, prosecutors said, he sent the source a text: ""I'm ready""Das arrived in the United States in 1995. He did not assimilate into U.S. culture, and remained a ""permanent resident,"" not a citizen.Despite the evidence that jihadis are motivated by Islam, top U.S. officials, including President Barack Obama, insist that Islam does not motivate jihad attacks.""Where we see terrorist organizations like al Qaeda or ISIL, they have perverted and distorted and tried to claim the mantle of Islam for an excuse for basically, barbarism and death,"" Obama recently told the mother of a U.S. soldier killed in Iraq. ""There's no religious rationale that would justify in any way any of the things that they do,"" Obama said Sept. 28.The prosecutor in the case described the Islamic motives of Das, but still used the language of criminal law to portray the attack as motivated by a ""terrorist organization,"" not by Islam's jihad doctrine. According to The Baltimore Sun,""Nelash Mohamed Das is alleged to have plotted to kill a U.S. service member on behalf of ISIL,"" said John Carlin, the assistant attorney general for national security, using an alternate acronym for the Islamic State. ""Individuals intent on carrying out violence in the name of foreign terrorist organizations pose one of the most concerning threats that law enforcement faces today, and stopping these offenders before they are able to act is our highest priority.""Despite the FBI's successful detention of many imported Islamic jihadis, the federal government is rapidly increasing the inflow of Islamic followers into the United States. In July, Breitbart reported that;Pew Research has estimated that immigration will cause the population of U.S. Muslims to more than double over the next two decades--from 2.6 million in 2010 to 6.2 million in 2030. This demographic change is entirely the product of legal admissions-that is, it is a formal policy of the federal government adopted by Congress.Repeated polls show that majorities of Americans want to exclude Islamic ideology from the United States.

That comes after last week's threat by Secretary of State John Kerry to suspend contacts amid new attacks on the city of Aleppo.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe department said in a statement Monday that Russia had not lived up to the terms of an agreement last month to restore the cease-fire and ensure sustained deliveries of humanitarian aid to besieged cities.As part of the suspension, the U.S. is withdrawing personnel that it had dispatched to take part in the creation of a joint U.S.-Russia center. That center was to have coordinated military cooperation and intelligence if the cease-fire had taken hold.

Thirty-five percent of the 1,062 Virginia registered voters disagreed with the jobs-before-cheap-goods statement.""The fact that people from all age, gender, racial and education agree with this basic statement should give strong pause to Congress if it should attempt to pass the TPP during a lame duck session,"" said Rick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government, in a political shot aimed at Virginia's two Democratic Senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine.The two Senators may be asked to vote for or against the deal during a lame-duck sessions of Congress after the election.The deal is backed by outgoing President Barack Obama, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and many business groups, plus the Speaker of the House, Rep. Paul Ryan.The poll also asked voters about one of the TPP's most controversial elements -- the creation of a three-judge panel that would have the power to override national laws that restrict companies' ability to move goods, factories or workers from one country to another. For example, the TPP rules apparently allow foreign companies to transplant low-wage Asian workforces into the United States, so bypassing U.S. immigration laws and lowering wages for Americans.The poll showed that 69 percent agreed with the statement, ""America must have the ability to set its own laws and regulations and not be bound to standards set by foreign nations and international organizations.""

The letter states the school discriminated against junior Bridget Christensen by denying her constitutional right to organize a school-sponsored Students for Life club called Dragons for Life.The letter, addressed to Dr. Kevin Riley, superintendent of Gretna Public Schools, and Roger Miller, principal of Gretna High School, charges that Christensen's attempt to start the student-led pro-life club met with resistance by school administrators who reportedly told her the club was too ""religious"" and also ""controversial.""The letter states:Bridget has been informed that while nearly every current club is sponsored by the school (""Sponsored Clubs""), religious, political, and other ""controversial"" clubs are only permitted to meet outside school hours (""Recognized Clubs""). She was offered no written copy of this policy, and our research has shown no written policy in the student handbook or any other official Gretna High School listing of clubs and extracurricular activities.Gretna High School's refusal to officially offer this pro-life club the same status as other extracurricular clubs constitutes a violation of Bridget's rights under both the federal Equal Access Act (""EAA"") and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Further, Gretna High School's unwritten ""two tier"" club policy is itself a violation of all students' rights under the EAA and the First Amendment.The letter adds that, in the prior school year, another student attempted to obtain official school-sponsored status for Dragons for Life, but was allegedly told by Miller that ""separation of church and state"" prevented the school from sponsoring the club.This year, Miller met with Christensen and her peers and reportedly told them Dragons for Life could not meet during school hours along with other school-sponsored clubs because the school district cannot support a ""lifestyle choice"" or ""endorse"" the pro-life movement. When the students raised the issue of the Gay Straight Alliance - which is a ""sponsored club"" of the high school - Miller reportedly told the pro-life students that the Gay Straight Alliance ""serves the purpose"" of preventing bullying.Thomas More Society special counsel Jocelyn Floyd, the lead counsel for Students for Life of America's high school clubs, observed that the Gretna High School administration response reflects a common misunderstanding of the law.""Pro-life students are simply asking for equal treatment, and this school's rationale for denying the group is that the club doesn't tie in with school curriculum--but neither do most of their other clubs,"" said Floyd.Attorneys from the Thomas More Society have dealt with similar cases in California, Iowa, Nevada, North Dakota, and Virginia.""These dismissive bans on pro-life clubs are unlawful and violate the First Amendment,"" Floyd continued. ""If the school has a chess club, service club, gay-straight alliance, movie club, or any other extracurricular group, they may not exclude a school Students for Life club.""Christensen said pro-life students at Gretna High School are being treated according to a ""double standard."" She explained in a statement:Instead of dedicating my time to educating my peers about abortion and creating a strong Students for Life group at my high school that could be a resource for those students facing unplanned pregnancies, I've been forced to argue against my own school administrators and fight for my First Amendment rights. My school administration has been treating me and my friends who want to start the Students for Life club like second-class citizens by not allowing us to be a school-sponsored club, even though they allow many other clubs that may be considered controversial. This double standard is discrimination and it's wrong.Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, added, ""Pro-life students have the same right to form a club as any other student in high school and cannot be discriminated against for their pro-life views.""""Bridget's rights were violated when the high school denied her request to form a Students for Life group in order to educate and inform her peers on the tragedy of abortion and to help those facing unplanned, crisis pregnancies,"" Hawkins said. ""Just because the school may not agree with the pro-life position doesn't give it the right to not allow the club to exist.""Students for Life of America and the Thomas More Society are requesting that the school district promptly approve the Students for Life club at Gretna High School.Bridget has been informed that while nearly every current club is sponsored by the school (""Sponsored Clubs""), religious, political, and other ""controversial"" clubs are only permitted to meet outside school hours (""Recognized Clubs"").

This is because her reforms center around comprehensive background checks-which already exist in California, Colorado, and Washington state, but were powerless to stop the Burlington mass shooting (September 23, 2016), the San Bernardino terror attack (December 2, 2015), and the Colorado Springs street shooting (October 31, 2015). Such checks also exist in Paris, France, yet Kim Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint over the weekend in Paris and 130 innocents were killed in a firearm-based terror attack on November 13, 2015.Clinton has also advocated for simply rounding up guns and destroying them, like they did with so many hundreds of thousands of firearms in Australia in 1996-1997. On October 16, 2016 she said Australia's gun ban was ""worth looking at"" for U.S. gun policy in America. Yet Australia is on the brink of passing a new slate of gun controls to deal with the gun crime that plagues the nation in the 21st century. For example, Melbourne, Australia, has had more than one shooting a week since January 2015, and The Age reports that gun violence has become so prominent that ""criminals are using gunshot wounds to the arms and legs as warnings to pay debts.""In addition to an official confiscatory policy on firearms, Clinton is pushing a narrower ban, focused on ""assault weapons,"" and a policy that would allow crime victims to sue gun sellers over crimes committed with legally manufactured and legally sold firearms.Clinton told the Little Rock AME Church congregation, ""Protecting all of God's children is America's calling... Our entire country should take a moment to really look at what's going on here and across America, to imagine what we see on the news and what we hear about, imagine it through our children's eyes.""AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

""It is a bunch of bull!""Clinton made a bizarre reference to the Civil War, paraphrasing a friend who is a Lincoln expert who explained one of the reasons Lincoln went to war: ""In the North there was no power elite, there was no slave labor, it was the greatest opportunity for people who started out poor to get into the middle class. We've got to do that again.""SIGN UP"

Roosevelt’s Four Freedoms Are from 1941: We Need New Freedoms in the 21st Century 	"SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER1. The Old Four FreedomsIn his 1941 State of the Union address, President Franklin D. Roosevelt articulated his vision of the American social contract, which became known as the ""Four Freedoms."" These were, ""freedom of speech,"" ""freedom of worship,"" ""freedom from want,"" and ""freedom from fear."" Those big ideas have defined much of the 20th century--and not just in America.Yet today, 75 years later, we might contemplate important new freedoms to strive for, even as we must struggle to preserve our old freedoms. And as we think about new freedoms, it helps to think practically. As they say, politics is the art of the possible.So perhaps it's best to take a closer look at Roosevelt's Four Freedoms; after that, we will be better prepared to think about a New Four Freedoms.Let's start by taking note of the context of FDR's speech of January 6, 1941. In that year--the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor would not come until December 7--America was finally recovering from the Depression, and so the public appetite for a radical domestic political solution, from either the right or the left, seemed to be receding, and yet nobody could be sure. So Roosevelt charted a centrist middle course; his articulation of freedom might have horrified libertarians on the right and communists on the left, but most Americans were thrilled.In the meantime, of course, America was under siege from around the world. On the right, the fascist Germans and Italians, and the imperialist Japanese, posed a direct military threat, as well as something of an ideological threat; some prominent Americans claimed that fascism was The Wave of the Future. And on the left, the communist Russians also posed an ideological threat, as well as an internal-security threat; many Soviet sympathizers, even spies, had burrowed their way into the U.S. government.And so as Roosevelt stood before Congress and the American people to deliver his assessment of the state of the union, the 32nd president knew that he had an intricate task. On the one hand, he had an obligation to preserve the essential freedoms of the Constitution, including the Bill of Rights. And on the other hand, he had a duty to advance the strongest possible case for Americanism to a skeptical, even hostile, world that had mostly turned to dictatorship to escape from depression and danger. Hence the Four Freedoms, as a statement of timeless American values, stood out as a bright beacon in a darkened world.FDR's four-fold vision--political liberty, religious tolerance, social compassion, and national security--was an immediate success, resonating deeply with the American public. In 1943, in the pages The Saturday Evening Post, the brilliant illustrator Norman Rockwell immortalized the Four Freedoms in a quartet of memorable paintings. In fact, during World War Two, the actual artworks themselves went on a nationwide tour to sell victory bonds.Moreover, FDR's larger message punched through around the planet, and ultimately, 26 countries joined the Allied side in the war. To be sure, many of those countries made only token contributions to the war effort, and yet still, their contribution was valuable, adding to the international perception that the nations of the world were uniting to oppose fascism.As they say, ""Ideas have consequences,"" and in this instance, Roosevelt's Four Freedoms had big consequences. By highlighting America as the champion of justice and tolerance, they helped the U.S. gain moral and diplomatic support, and thus helped to win the great war.Moreover, in the seven decades since, enshrined as national policy, the Four Freedoms have helped America to win (mostly) the peace here at home.To be sure, the Four Freedoms, like all our freedoms, are constantly under threat. As we all know, freedom of speech is under insidious challenge here in the U.S.; on college campuses, in particular, the proto-totalitarian forces of political correctness seem to have gained the upper hand. And freedom of worship, too, is under fire, as Christians have learned to their dismay. In addition, we all know that freedom from fear is bitter joke to many Americans, because of domestic crime and unrest, or because of foolish foreign wars, or because of the surging threat from domestic terrorism--even as our own government insists on importing, at taxpayer expense, more possible terrorists.And the fourth of FDR's freedoms, ""freedom from want,"" also still raises hackles. Many libertarians, for example, inveigh against freedom from want as not a freedom at all, but rather as a threat--the threat of coercive taxation. One such is Edward L. Hudgins, writing for the Cato Institute; he has decreed the imputed evil of statism in Roosevelt's speech. Such ""positive freedom,"" he wrote, could mean ""that government must provide a house to those who can't afford one.""Indeed, Hudgins offers a forthright restatement of the libertarian stance against any government action to eliminate want:In such a case either government agents must march you out at gunpoint and force you to build the house or do a kinder, gentler version of the same thing: tax you to pay to have one built. Someone's right to a house means you are deprived of your money.And he closed with,Freedom from want implies eternal satisfaction with all desires met. That is a utopia. And that is impossible. Just ask the Russians.As Hudgins brings up the supposed threat of communism--that is, the idea that a government program equals Bolshevism--one is reminded of the danger of the reductio ad absurdum; that is, taking things to a ridiculous extreme. Or, to put the matter another way, we can recall this witticism: The four most important words in the English language are, ""Up to a point."" Once again: not every government action takes us down the slippery slope to Soviet communism.And so we can just say it: For the American government to establish a floor under people's existence, such that they don't starve or end up on the streets--well, that's common sense, not communism. It's enlightened and realistic leadership, taking into account the vagaries of modern life and the need to avoid domestic discord--to say nothing of simple human compassion.To be sure, compassion comes in better and worse forms. Notably, we can admire the work-not-welfare programs--such as the Civilian Conservation Corps--that were championed by FDR in the 1930s. In addition, we can further admire the tough-love welfare reform spearheaded, more recently, by former Wisconsin governor Tommy Thompson. And from those no-nonsense relief programs, one can draw inspiration about the controversies of today: Specifically, we don't want a welfare system that encourages and subsidizes multi-generational dependency, and all the pathologies that go with it.So today, it's easy to criticize governmental foolishness; there's plenty of that. Yet it's hard, at least for elected officials if they wish to be re-elected, to take the libertarian argument to its full extreme. That is, it's politically dangerous, often fatal, to pivot from a critique of governmental excess to a critique of basic earned-entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare--and yet that's exactly what Hudgins does.To be sure, Hudgins has plenty of fellow believers on his side. One can read, for example, the manifestos of Ayn Rand, Ludwig von Mises, or Murray Rothbard and learn the maximum case against even a minimum government safety net.Yet there's still one big problem with all these libertarian critiques: The American people don't agree.Let's start with the program that both friends and foes would agree is the archstone of the mixed-economy welfare state: Social Security. When the program was enacted in 1935, the vote in the House was 372-33, and in the Senate, 77-6. So we can see, the program was extremely popular even before any retiree received a penny. And that's not really surprising: Back then, the idea of guaranteeing dignity for the elderly was in the air; such programs had existed in Europe for decades, and in the decades since, the idea has spread around the world.Yet even so, many libertarians, and even, at times, some Republican politicians, have chosen to make opposition to Social Security their signature issue--even if it never ends well.  Here's how the same Cato Institute recalled two failed Republican efforts in two different decades, the 1960s and the 1980s:Barry Goldwater's early support for privatizing Social Security in the 1964 presidential campaign is widely credited with having destroyed whatever slim hopes he may have had of winning that race.  And one of Ronald Reagan's worst political missteps was a short-lived effort to cap the benefits of Social Security.Despite this dismal record, some GOPers have chosen to keep trying: In 2005, President George W. Bush, freshly re-elected, proposed the partial privatization of Social Security. Bush's plan was heavily hedged and safeguarded, and yet even so, the thought of messing with Social Security was anathema to most Americans, and so the bill never even came to a vote in either the Republican-controlled House or Senate. (Even so, in part because of the pro-Social Security backlash, the GOP lost control of both chambers in the 2006 midterms.)Thus we can see that the core of ""freedom from want"" is well-protected--protected by the impermeable carapace of staunch public support.So perhaps most of us can agree that all four of FDR's four freedoms--of speech, of worship, from fear, and yes, from want--aren't such a bad idea. Needless to say, some on the right, in their heart of hearts, may still wish to bury the idea of freedom from want, but perhaps the better angels of practicality will persuade them to find something more productive to worry about in public.2. The Curious Case of the Inspiring Edward ConardThus as we make our peace with FDR's Four Freedoms--all the while, trying to perfect them, even as the simultaneous evils of oppression and anarchy are trying to subvert them--it's perfectly reasonable for liberty lovers to ponder new ways by which to advance liberty.So now we might ask: What comes next? In particular, libertarians might ask themselves: What's the next frontier for freedom? And, hopefully, could there be more than one?We can start by realizing that in the political realm--and it's hard to think of anything that happens in the real world without the interplay of politics--there will always be tradeoffs. That is, if libertarians want something, they must figure out how to get it done, and what it takes. As noted, politics is the art of the possible.And here, I will freely confess, even proclaim, that I have been influenced by Edward Conard, a former partner of Mitt Romney's at Bain Capital and, most recently, the author of The Upside of Inequality: How Good Intentions Undermine the Middle Class. In this book, Conard wrestles with that key aspect of politics--the art of the possible. Conrad himself is an unabashed free-market capitalist who first burst into prominence in 2012, declaring his full-throated support for Romney, Bain, and the capitalist system. Yet as we all remember, in 2012, that didn't work out so well. Not only did Romney lose, but since then, the rise of Bernie Sanders and his socialism tells us that neither private equity funds nor capitalism itself are popular.In his new book, Conard shows that he has moved with the times. He puts forth an interesting and original argument: The real cause of the slow-growing economy of today is the shortage of human capital--that is, smart and skilled people who can apply the arts of innovation and entrepreneurship to existing problems.Conard makes a good point: The economy has changed. In the past, what economists call the ""factors of production"" were typically defined as land, natural resources, and capital. It was these tangible inputs that, when combined together by brainy and hard-working people, created new kinds of output. Yet today, much of the economy has been virtualized, and so the old tangibles have been supplanted by new intangibles; indeed, one could even say that the most important factors of production today are highly intangible: IQ, adrenalin, and caffeine.Of course, no advance in productivity happens automatically. Thus, as Conard argues, it's vitally important to allow the processes of innovation and entrepreneurship to continue--and, indeed, for the sake of economic growth, to accelerate them. Which is to say, incentives matter. As Conard writes, ""Taxation . . . appears to have large detrimental effects on risk-taking, innovation, productivity, and growth over the long run.""Okay, so that's Conard's ultimate view, which will get no argument from me: We need low tax rates to encourage productive risk-taking. And without a doubt, Conard's assertions, so far at least, are music to the ears of all freedom-lovers. Ayn Rand, for example, was all about the power of individual genius, and von Mises wrote a book called, simply, Human Action.Of course, Romney thought the same thing, and we know what happened to him. And Donald Trump, too, thinks tax rates should be reduced--and at the moment, he's behind in most polls.And yet here's where Conard gets interesting: He is far more than just a libertarian pamphleteer; while his own ideology is clear enough, he has also thought deeply about the art-of-the-possible point. And so he has some fresh suggestions as to winning over a skeptical public to his point of view.In particular, Conard is willing to concede two big points to the populist-nationalists: Namely, that globalized trade, as well as immigration, has cost jobs and hurt ordinary workers' incomes. And so Conard endorses Trumpian measures to close the border and limit trade deficits.As Conard explained in a tweet, ""Enough middle ground btwn @realDonaldTrump voters & free-marketers 2 | working-class wages w/compromise.""The point is that Conard is making a political-economic offer to the Trump voters, as well as blue-collar Sanders voters: We will protect you against the gale winds of globalization, even as capitalists create more jobs here in the U.S. And in return, you must protect us against anticompetitive and unproductive confiscation. In other words, we need each other to fight the real enemy: the socialists, as well as the anti-growth greens and the anti-American multiculturalists.Thus we can see the outlines of an attractive political platform: jobs for workers, profits for owners. Why, one could even say that it looks a lot like America at its zenith, in the middle of the last century, when we not only won World War Two, but also drove the unemployment rate down to one percent--only this time, with much lower tax rates!Thus in the person of Edward Conard, we can see a little bit of that FDR spirit--the spirit of charting a practical course that could generate a critical mass of support that will in turn stave off the crazies.Conard's heterodox views have raised eyebrows on the right. That is, conservatives and libertarians who were with him on tax-rate reductions found themselves pulling back when they got to his prescriptions on immigration and trade. Indeed, Conard's platform is downright hateful to orthodox libertarians who want the ""whole enchilada""--that is, all the policy prescriptions to be found at, say, the Cato website.And yet in the real world, down below the ivory tower, most Americans, whether or not they support Trump, have already embraced such views. For example, according to a new poll from Harvard University, 54 percent of Democrats believe that free trade has lost more U.S. jobs than it has created, as well as 66 percent of independents and 85 percent of Republicans. Indeed, the same poll found that only eight percent of Republicans, 11 percent of independents, and 19 percent of Democrats think free trade has led to higher wages for American workers. We can sum up those findings: A huge majority opposes the free-trade status quo, judging it to be harmful to American workers and their incomes. (As an aside, we can marvel at all the billions that have been spent on behalf of favored libertarian causes, and how little effect such expenditures have had.)It remains to be seen how Conard's policy prescription will fare in the ongoing battle of ideas: To his fans on the right, he's a champion of practical policies that might enable the prime goal, the preservation of incentives, to survive. And yet to his foes on the right, he's a squish and a sellout. And of course, to the resurgent left, he's just another rich fat-cat who should be soaked.Still, most Americans, were they to hear of Conard's pragmatic synthesis, would probably respond favorably.Okay, so now, in that same spirit of pragmatism, let's consider some other possibilities. Specifically, let's think about some new freedoms that are worth fighting for and that, indeed, might attract support for the center-right position from across the ideological spectrum.Yet before we can proceed, let's first get something out of the way: Let's resolve to give up on the no-win war against Social Security and similar programs, especially earned entitlements, including Medicare. As we have seen, the national decision has already been made--we will be our brother's keeper. And as the last 80 years demonstrate, the ideological right can huff and puff all it wants, and still, the House of FDR still stands.So let's stipulate that we accept FDR's Four Freedoms--all four of them. Let's say to those who wish to fight losing battles: Do it on your own time, away from the center-right mainstream that seeks to win elections, enact reforms, and, yes, advance freedom in the future. So now let's consider prospects for freedom in the future.3. The New Four FreedomsSuppose a U.S. president, in some future state of the union address, were to outline this quartet of new freedoms:So let's look at each in turn:First, the Freedom to Create. It's true what they say: The power to tax is the power to destroy. So it follows, then, that freedom from oppressive taxation is the power to create. We can all think of clever, wonderful, even transformative products that emerged from the brow of some inventor and from the sweat-equity of some entrepreneur. We never want to lose that magic, and the prospect of more of it.To be sure, to say ""systematized creativity"" is just another way of saying ""free enterprise.'' Okay, so be it; free-marketeers have always expounded on the virtues of incentives--and they've always been right.And yet as everyone in politics knows, being right isn't good enough--one has to be smart, and realistic.  In this mistrustful climate--where so much creativity and productivity has been hied off to China, the public is no mood to hear arguments about the long-term benefits of free trade. Indeed, to be blunt about it, the American people are not going to provide safe harbor for innovators and entrepreneurs--that is, the legal protection against bandits and pirates, as well as national protection against foreign attackers--unless some benefit accrues to them.Thus we come to the need for a revised social contract--that is, the terms by which we all agree to live with each other in this country. It seems safe to say that a system in which the jobs go overseas and the wealth accumulates to the one percent--that's not a system that's going to last for much longer. That is, if the political system can't hammer out a compromise in which everyone shares in the benefits of productivity growth, then, as a result, we'll get a new new political system, in which the Constitution, for example, could well be shredded. Or, as another possibility over the long run, if present trends continue, we'll suffer an erosion of national morale such that we are easy pickings for foreign invasion, even conquest.Since neither of those are attractive options, let's focus on preserving our system--a system that has, in the past, found a way to provide for the interests of both capital and labor. And yet at the same time, let's not hide from changes that need to be made. We must heed the great voice of history that is counseling us, ""Reform, that you may preserve.""Second, the Freedom to Be a Sovereign and Secure Individual. Do you remember the old days--that is, the 1990s--when the Internet was thought to be a tool of personal empowerment?  Or even, some dared to say, of liberation? Today, we can probably all agree that the Net is a marvelous tool, but that the empowering, liberating vision has gone sadly haywire.Specifically, we are coming to realize that the same tool that empowers us also exposes us. When Yahoo admits that 500 million customer accounts have been hacked in one fell swoop, we all get a wakeup call: The Internet, which was built, originally, for individual survivability, has now become a thing of collective vulnerability. That is, every day we wake up and wonder if we've been hacked, or otherwise violated.And at the same time, every day we wake up and realize that big companies, as well as governments, now know exactly what we're doing, with a precision and granularity vastly exceeding anything that George Orwell ever dreamed of in 1984. Our data--which is to say, our lives--are now both a target for enemies and a product for profit.To be sure, a few tech savants might be able to encrypt their way out of this pervasive surveillance, and it's hard not to sympathize with them. And yet at the same time, we are reminded that terrorists, too, can ""go dark."" So for the sake of our country, some judicious compromise will have to be found, protecting both privacy and security. The current status quo--in which hackers, corporations, and governments, including foreign governments, each get a piece of us--should not, and will not, stand.So a president who offers a path to securing personal freedom and autonomy in cyberspace, while still securing legitimate property rights, and while also securing the nation against crime and terrorism, will be offering the American people, in effect, a new deal. And that proffered deal will, among other considerations, be a political winner.Third, the Freedom to Enjoy a Long and Productive Life. If you want freedom, you must first be alive to enjoy it. That's an obvious enough point, but it seems to have escaped policy-makers in the last quarter-century.That is, while Washington has been wrangling over the fine points of national  health insurance, veritable epidemics of deadly disease have erupted in our midst.We all know about Alzheimer's Disease, which exacts such a terrible toll on the personal health of many, as well as the fiscal health of all of us. And just in the last few years, new threats, such as the Zika and Ebola viruses, have emerged. Indeed, thanks to unchecked immigration, we are importing a raft of additional maladies, from dengue fever to extreme new forms of tuberculosis.So we need a new commitment to curing disease itself, as opposed to simply to financing the care for its ravages. Fortunately, our own history is rich with examples of the successful, or at least mostly successful, combating of disease.  Over the last two centuries, we have beaten back malaria, yellow fever, tuberculosis, smallpox, polio, and AIDS. In some of these instances, such as smallpox, our victory has been complete; the dreaded virus was officially declared ""eradicated"" back in 1980. Yet at the same time, in regard to other plagues, such as TB, we are actually losing ground, as foolish and neglectful policies hold sway.Meanwhile, other maladies, such as cancer, take some 600,000 lives a year--it killed even a multi-billionaire, Steve Jobs, at 56. It was nice that Vice President Joe Biden announced a ""moon shot"" against cancer earlier this year; it would have been nicer if the Obama administration had put real muscle behind the effort. The Obama-Biden administration could have drawn inspiration from the way that Franklin D. Roosevelt shouldered the vast public-private effort known as the March of Dimes in the 30s and 40s. That campaign, of course, led to the Salk Vaccine in 1955. Instead, this administration chose the way of the press release--and not much else.Fortunately, even as this government flounders, philanthropy is stepping up. It's heartening that one Silicon Valley mogul, Sean Parker, recently committed $250 million to curing disease, and that another mogul, Mark Zuckerberg, has committed $3 billion. The rest of us can only hope that such big giving on behalf of cures--surely, the ultimate form of enlightened self-interest--will continue, and that a new kind of virtuous one-upmanship will take hold among the one percent.Yet in the meantime, we might further hope that the political system, too, can provide help. We can dream that a future president will see the value in establishing the right regulatory climate, as well as the right tax incentives, so that America, and humanity, can make more progress against common medical enemies. And also, critically, so that we can take steps to make sure that the health benefits of new medicines are widely shared. We can add: That's the way that we'll make federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare, more affordable: Healthier people, living and working longer, don't cost so much.Fourth, the Freedom to Explore the Universe. It's startling to think that the the first American walked on the moon in 1969, nearly five decades ago, and that the last American to walk on the moon did so in 1972. We might look back at that epic achievement--and the subsequent abandonment of that achievement--and ask ourselves: What have we been doing? What have we been thinking?No one doubts that space travel is expensive, even dangerous.  And yet here again, a new generation of visionary billionaires--including Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Eric Schmidt--have charted out a new and better destiny for mankind in the stars. (In the meantime, it's not necessary to admire their terrestrial politics.) We don't yet know what will prove viable and what won't; we only know that it's important.And why is that? We can trot out the usual arguments about the spirit of adventure and discovery--those are perfectly valid.  And yet we can also cite a more gut argument: Eventually--and that ""eventually"" could come any time--this lonely planet will prove too small, and too fragile, to hold all of us. That is, one day, a great war, or a great epidemic, or a great something, will engulf us. And so with that dreadful fate in mind, it's best to compartmentalize humanity--to have, as it were, a lifeboat. As a Chinese proverb tells us, ""The wise rabbit has three holes to hide in."" Today, it's little wonder that China has an advanced space program, full of military, as well as exploratory, potential. And so we, too, had better get cracking.Moreover, once again, we can take note of political realities that our shaping the context of our time: In an era when the political system of this nation, and most of the nations of the world, is gathering in anger against the perceived abuses of the plutocracy, those same plutocrats are well advised to show that they are doing something beneficial with their money. Curing disease is one such benefit, traveling to space is another. (And sharing with workers, we might add, is a third.)So there we have it: a New Four Freedoms. As noted, these new freedoms are only possible if we build them atop the platform of the original Four Freedoms, as well as, of course, the original freedoms delineated in the Constitution.And yet as a nation, we can never sit still, either because of smugness or fatalism. The Founders intended for our freedom, and our country, to be dynamic.Indeed, it seems fair to say that the New Four Freedoms would strengthen all the freedoms that we have already established.And that should be enough to gladden the heart of every true patriot.SIGN UP"

It is unacceptable that it is led by someone who believes in collusion. Normalization continues to humiliate our brave people on a daily basis.""Further condemnation came from the Fatah student union at Bir Zeit University, the influential West Bank institution. Also opening with a quote from the Quran condemning collusion with the enemy, the union's statement said: ""The humiliating and offensive participation [in the funeral] is a form of treason. Before the President went to the funeral of the criminal Peres, we appealed to all the government agencies hoping he would take back his humiliating decision.""Following the announcement, Fatah stated it suspended the members behind the Abbas criticism. Some claimed that Abbas' critics were abused and threatened by the PA security forces.The Fatah rebels, meanwhile, celebrated Usama Mansur Abu Arab, a top official in the PA's Israel Coordination Directorate, who was suspended from his role for posting a Facebook post in which he called on Abbas to cancel his participation. Abu Arab was arrested over the weekend, which gave him even greater popular support.Abbas was criticized left, right and center on social media. Among the posts that went viral was a video of an 80-year-old Palestinian woman who insulted Abbas during an interview with her grandson. A cartoon showing Abbas as a kippa-clad Jewish soldier weeping at Peres' grave also went viral.SIGN UP"

But if they could they would see what I saw behind closed doors all of those years ago. They'd see a completely different human being from the one presented to the voters. Because in Hillary they'd see a coarse, profane political operative. With no moral compass. And a complete willingness to manipulate the rule of law to her benefit. They would see a fearsome, paranoid individual with zero concern for the masses. She sees the voting block merely as a necessary evil to achieve her goals. She is a total impressive smoke and mirrors act.""Listen to Part Two of the Linda Tripp interview:Tripp revealed some of what she personally witnessed firsthand of Clinton's temperament and the way she says White House staff feared the First Lady to the point of ""cowering"" in her presence.""In the Clinton White House there was endless screaming,"" she recalled. ""Constant vulgar profanity on the part of both the President and the First Lady. And it's hard for me to refer to her as the First Lady, frankly.""You've heard all about the hurling of hard objects. All of that was true. But what you haven't heard is the cowering of the White House staff in her presence. There was a contempt for the military. And this is a woman who believes she is entitled to be commander-in-chief. And that was very, very difficult for me. Having had a 20-year history with the military. And a deep, abiding respect for all the members of the Armed Services. She had a hatred of Republicans. And I have think we have seen that with her basket of deplorables (comments). Sometimes the truth just peaks out.""Asked whether she actually saw Hillary throw hard objects at Bill Clinton, Tripp replied, ""No, we just saw the result on the president's face. Literally.""She continued:""I know that that sounds scandalous. And that sounds as though that couldn't possibly be true. But 99% of the scandals are completely unbelievable to those who didn't see behind the [Clinton] curtain. You know, it's almost a piling on kind of a thing. Because most people in their average everyday lives, they are going to work; they are driving the kids to soccer; there is homework; there are bills to pay. They don't pay as close attention as someone like myself might because they're just too darn busy. And it sounds like what the Clintons constantly say. That it's the partisan witch-hunt. That it's the vast right-wing conspiracy. Everyone conspires against the Clintons. They take no ownership or accountability for all of the scandals they themselves created.""But it's completely understandable to me why most people would think that this can't possibly be true. This is not the person we see debating. And she is a polished debater. You know this just can't be true and yet it is.""Listen to Part Three of the Linda Tripp interview:""I just think that when you talk about temperament you have to at least consider how the past portends the future,"" Tripp added.The Clintons possessed no respect or honor for the office of the presidency, Tripp charged:""I remember a senior adviser to President Bush. A nice guy. I am not going to name his name. But a very senior advisor who had said to a few of us one day that he pinched himself every single day that he entered the White House to go to work. And he said further if you don't feel that way you don't belong here. And it resonated because those of us who did feel that way thought, 'Ah, it's not just us. There is a reverence. There is an honor.' A feeling of history that we are so fortunate to be a part of. Of course, none of that pertains to the Clintons.""Hillary Clinton has in the past claimed numerous times that she was not yet decided on whether to run for president. One notorious example was Clinton's response to why she took six-figure speaking fees from Goldman Sachs and other big Wall Street banks. ""I wasn't committed to running. I didn't know whether I would or not,"" Clinton said in February.Tripp scoffed at the notion that Hillary was contemplating running for the presidency.""Well, this is one of the funniest things because literally on my first day in the West Wing of the White House in January of 1993, right after the inauguration, there was a chant from various senior advisors to support staff of the president. And it was 'Eight years for Bill. Eight years for Hill.' In fact, some had started out with 'Four years for Bill. Four years for Hill.' And they were quickly corrected. But I didn't know at that time that this runaway train was actually going to happen. Or worse, what it means for all of us today.""And you know she had a plan to punch her ticket. And so to punch the ticket to get to the presidency you need to have a resume. And so the whole Senate thing was part of the plan.""Tripp spoke generally of various ethical concerns during her time working in the West Wing:""Both the Clintons operate from a position of ethical bankruptcy. And in doing so they have been stacking the deck for many years. They have ensured they are above the law, as we saw this year. So whether it was obstructing justice or hiding documents. You know the abusing and besmirching of women. Their patented strategy of personal destruction of those who would speak out against them. And perjury.They have insulated themselves with total political power. And the accumulation of vast wealth. Those are hard things to go up against. So it's worked well for them...And there was always the commingling and the pay-for-play. And I mean from the smallest way to the largest way. There was the wholesale selling of the Lincoln bedroom. And rides on Air Force One. And money all the time. It was just very difficult for someone who had seen another White House operate in a way that one would expect a White House to operate.""Listen to Part Four of the Linda Tripp interview:Tripp is well-known for her role in the Monica Lewinsky scandal, documenting evidence of the young intern's relationship with Bill Clinton and submitting the documentation to independent counsel Kenneth Starr, leading to the public disclosure of the affair.However, many people may be surprised to learn of Tripp's larger role in the West Wing, and her firsthand experiences behind the curtain of the Clinton scandal machine.Tripp was brought to the Clinton administration from the George H.W. Bush White House, where she served as executive assistant to the deputy chief of staff to the president, a role that enabled her to become familiar with the inner workings of the West Wing.During the Clinton administration, she first served as support staff to the Immediate Office of the President, where she sat just outside Bill Clinton's Oval Office. After three months, Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster asked Tripp to work for the White House Counsel's office as executive assistant to White House Counsel Bernie Nussbaum, who played a lead role in defending the Clintons in their infamous scandals.Last week, Breitbart News reported on the first part of Clinton's interview on ""Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,"" in which she discussed some of the most infamous scandals to rock the Bill Clinton White House.Tripp possesses insider information on the scandals known as Travelgate, Filegate and Whitewater, and she personally witnessed the handling of documents from Vince Foster's office the morning after he was found dead in an apparent suicide. Foster was heavily involved in defending the Clintons in the Travelgate, Filegate and Whitewater cases. Tripp was the last person known to have spoken to Foster before his death.During the first portion of our interview, Tripp reopened each of those scandals - Travelgate, Filegate, Whitewater and the issues surrounding Vince Foster's death - and she used her unique vantage point to explain how the notorious cases foreshadowed many of the current Clinton controversies, from the Clinton Foundation to Hillary Clinton's private email server troubles.Aaron Klein is Breitbart's Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
