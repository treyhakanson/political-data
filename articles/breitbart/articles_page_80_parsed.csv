SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""The only point I would make for the tech community is on the H1B visas, I support them. When I was a Senator from New York I supported them,"" she told a meeting hosted by a software company in August 2014, according to a document apparently prepared by her campaign team. The 72-page document lists many of the controversial statements she made in 2013 and 2014, presumably to help her staff prepare responses if the speeches are were released. The new comments add to an extensive list of other pro-H-1B statements by Clinton. Currently, the federal government is providing multi-year H-1B work visas to roughly 650,000 foreign graduates to work in jobs sought by American graduates.The foreign graduates fill 100,000 teaching, research and medical jobs at American colleges, they fill engineering jobs at Caterpillar in Illinois, up to 70 accounting jobs at McDonalds' headquarters in Ohio, plus many more medical, teaching, management and software jobs in Florida, Connecticut, and California and throughout the United States.""So let me just make three quick points,"" she said in April 2014, at a summit hosted by a marketing company. ""One, I think it's essential to keep focused on the [H-1B] visa issue, because that's a discrete problem that even though I'd like to see it be part of an overall, comprehensive reform, you have to keep pushing to open the aperture, you know, get more and more opportunities.""The marketing firm, Marketo Inc., hires H-1Bs in place of Americans, according to a website that tracks H-1B hires. In contrast, Trump produced a plan in May to reform the H-1B program so that it doesn't outsource Americans' jobs. The plan promised to:Increase prevailing wage for H-1Bs. We graduate two times more Americans with STEM degrees each year than find STEM jobs, yet as much as two-thirds of entry-level hiring for IT jobs is accomplished through the H-1B program. More than half of H-1B visas are issued for the program's lowest allowable wage level, and more than eighty percent for its bottom two. Raising the prevailing wage paid to H-1Bs will force companies to give these coveted entry-level jobs to the existing domestic pool of unemployed native and immigrant workers in the U.S., instead of flying in cheaper workers from overseas. This will improve the number of black, Hispanic and female workers in Silicon Valley who have been passed over in favor of the H-1B program. Mark Zuckerberg's personal Senator, Marco Rubio, has a bill to triple H-1Bs that would decimate women and minorities.Requirement to hire American workers first. Too many visas, like the H-1B, have no such requirement. In the year 2015, with 92 million Americans outside the workforce and incomes collapsing, we need companies to hire from the domestic pool of unemployed. Petitions for workers should be mailed to the unemployment office, not USCIS.Many of the H-1B visa-holders manage to convert their work-permits into Green Cards, so they can become long-term residents of the United States. For example, data provided by one visa-tracking site, MyVisaJobs.com, shows that the H-1B program has pumped at least 100,000 foreign professionals into Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, where they now compete against white-collar Americans.The inflow of foreign workers, both blue collar and white-collar, drives down wages and raise profits, according to a September 22 report by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine. That ""immigration tax"" transfer roughly $500 billion per year from Americans worker to employers, shareholders and to new immigrants.In June, 2013, Clinton told an event for a personnel-management trade association that she agreed with their call for government to expand the H-1B program to start providing work-permits to all foreigners who graduate from U.S. colleges with masters' degrees. She declared:Specifically about H-1B visas, you know, we give so many more student visas than we give H-1B visas ... I support what you're trying to do because I think our economic recovery is to some extent fueled by a steady stream of well-qualified, productive workers coming out of our own institutions, native born, legally here and those who have something to contribute who are going to help us continue to grow our economy.On the 2016 campaign trail, her campaign has repeated that offer to ""staple Green Cards"" to foreigners' college degrees. In 2013, Clinton supported a similar provision that was included in the Senate's ""Comprehensive Immigration Reform bill, but the measure was eventually killed by GOP grassroots opposition in June 2014. If it had been enacted, it would now be providing companies with an unlimited supply of lower-wage foreign graduates to hire instead of American graduates. Clinton's open-borders promise to foreign graduates is posted at her campaign site, and is titled ""Hillary Clinton's Initiative on Technology & Innovation.""But Clinton's support for H-1Bs is just a corner of Clinton's larger support for tight cooperation between government and major corporations, regardless of national borders.In 2013, she told one audience that ""my dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere."" That statement was made in May 2013 to an audience invited by Banco Itau.Her dream for every ""person"" presumably includes the 320 million Americans in the United States -- but it apparently also includes roughly 470 million other people in the hemisphere, from Argentina to Brazil to Venezuela to Honduras to Mexico and Canada. The November election is intended to pick a president for the United States, not a president for the hemisphere.For Clinton, those national barriers and politicians' duties to national populations are washed away by immigration. At the Nexenta event, for example, she described her country as merely ""a nation of immigrants."" In fact, the United States is a nation of 280 million Americans who have invited 40 million foreign to join them in the United States. But she is a politician, and knows that if she wants to be elected, so must be careful to make token statements to reassure voters. At the Nexenta event where she praised the H-1B outsourcing program and the 2013 mass-immigration bill, she also suggested that companies try to show some ""sensitivity"" towards American job-seekers.But given the great recession and the fact that so many people lost jobs across the economy including in the tech field, there has to be an extra effort made to try to fill jobs with people who are already here. They can be either native born or immigrants, but already here, so that then if that's not possible you have a good faith argument that you tried, because too many people [think] the H1B visas are, instead of an opportunity to get good, strong talent, a way of avoiding hiring American workers. So I do think there has to be some sensitivity to that, but I believe that's doable.  I don't think that's an overwhelming task.
But the request for ""sensitivity"" come from Clinton, who also told another audience in April 2013 that government officials often need to work behind-closed doors.""If everybody's watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position,"" she said, according to the leaked document.Each year, 4 million Americans turn 18 years old and enter the workforce. But, each year, the federal government also imports 2 million immigrants, guest-workers, refugees and asylum seekers and illegal immigrants. The inflow of professionals and workers drives down the salaries of American white-collar and blue-collar workers while boosting income for investors and employers.The inflow also crowd the schools used by the children of lower-income Americans, sharply increases tax transfers from Americans to immigrants, reduces innovation and productivity, pushes many lower-skilled Americans out of the workforce, and enables large-scale violence by immigrant communities and crime against Americans who do not live in protected neighborhoods. Few of the elite leaders in the GOP or the Democratic Party care about the costs or risks of mass immigration. 
Increase prevailing wage for H-1Bs. We graduate two times more Americans with STEM degrees each year than find STEM jobs, yet as much as two-thirds of entry-level hiring for IT jobs is accomplished through the H-1B program.

Reid has taken aim at everything from the accuracy of Real Clear Politics to how Trump recently pronounced Nevada at a recent campaign stop. Using nearly identical tactics as he did against Mitt Romney during the 2012 presidential election, Reid made unsubstantiated claims about Trump's tax returns and even invoked the Koch Brothers.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe 76-year-old Reid told reporters on a conference call that Trump ""raped and pillaged Atlantic City,"" backing the claim only by saying, ""Who knows what his tax returns would show?""Reid also made the allegation that Trump would not release his taxes because ""they'll expose him as a spoiled, rich brat who lost the millions he inherited from his father."" Trump has built a business and real estate empire worth billions.Reid, who lives in the Ritz-Carlton in Washington, D.C., despite spending his career in the public sector, chastised Trump for the ""penthouse his daddy bought him"":If Trump wants to come down from the penthouse his daddy bought him to lecture us on Nevada, he could at least pronounce it correctly.-- Senator Harry Reid (@SenatorReid) October 6, 2016Reid also took offense to Trump's recent joke that Nevadans do not use the correct pronunciation of Nevada; Nevadans pronounce it Nev-ad-a not Nev-ah-duh:Trump told us we pronounce our state wrong; then he refused to take stance on Yucca.It's pronounced Nev-AD-a and Yucca Mountain is dead.-- Senator Harry Reid (@SenatorReid) October 6, 2016Reid also attacked Real Clear Politics after a reporter asked him about the consistent lead Republican Senate candidate Congressman Joe Heck holds over Reid's handpicked successor Catherine Cortez Masto. ""I don't want to let any of the air out of your balloon, buddy, but Real Clear Politics is one of the worst,"" Reid told the reporter. ""Catherine is going to win by a nice margin,"" Reid continued. ""Real Clear Politics is totally unimpressive to me.""Reid also trotted out another one of his favorite 2012 themes by attacking the Koch Brothers, stating that they are ""trying to buy the Senate because they know that Hillary [Clinton]'s going to win.""The attacks are vintage Reid, who is not seeking reelection to the Senate this year.Dustin Stockton is a political reporter for Breitbart News, a community liaison for Gun Owners of America, and a political strategist.

He appeared at a closed hearing in federal court in Baltimore on Aug. 29 and has been in government custody since, according to court records.During a court-ordered search of Martin's home, the FBI ""seized thousands of pages of documents and dozens of computers or other digital storage devices and media,"" prosecutor Zachary Myers said in a court filing made public Wednesday afternoon. ""The digital media contained many terabytes of information that must be reviewed by appropriate authorities.""""When Booz Allen learned of the arrest of one of its employees by the FBI, we immediately reached out to the authorities to offer our total cooperation in their investigation, and we fired the employee,"" the company wasted no time in declaring. ""We continue to cooperate fully with the government on its investigation into this serious matter. There have been no material changes to our client engagements as a result of this matter. Booz Allen is a 102-year-old company, and the alleged conduct does not reflect our core values.""The Washington Post quotes U.S. officials who said Martin was ""hoarding"" classified materials ""going back as far as a decade in his house and car, and the recent leak of the hacking tools tipped investigators to what he was doing.""According to these sources, some of the documents found at his home ""could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security of the United States.""The ""hacking tools"" referenced in the Post story are the cyber-weapons put up for auction by a group calling itself the ""Shadow Brokers"" in August. These wares were purportedly the best hacks from the NSA's Equation Group, and a number of observers at the time said they looked like the real deal. NBC News reports some of the hacking code in Martin's possession was the same as the material offered by the Shadow Brokers.It would appear investigators were able to track Martin down as the source of this leak very quickly. (Or, as the Politico report suggests, the timeline of Martin's arrest might make it difficult to connect him to the Shadow Brokers.)The Washington Post calls Martin's arrest ""another humiliating lapse for both Booz Allen and the NSA,"" following Snowden absconding with a vast trove of sensitive documents. The New York Times cites officials attempting to defend the administration by pointing out many of the documents taken by Martin were evidently taken before the Snowden story broke, and new security measures were put in place.Politico suggests the delay in publicly announcing Martin's arrest and initial court appearance could mean he is cooperating with the government. He has voluntarily waived his right to be indicted or released within 30 days, giving prosecutors until March 1st to prepare an indictment.Prosecutors appear to be working on a plea-bargain deal, telling the court that trying Martin would be difficult because defense lawyers would not have the security clearances necessary to review the evidence. The sensitive nature of the evidence is also why it is so difficult for the public to be told the extent of the damage he might have caused to national security.""At this point, these are mere allegations. There is no evidence that Hal Martin intended to betray his country. What we do know is that Hal Martin loves his family and his country. He served our nation honorably in the United States Navy, and he has devoted his entire career to serving and protecting America,"" said the defense lawyers in question, Jim Wyda and Deborah Boardman.However, FBI agents noted Martin falsely denied taking the sensitive documents found in his home and car, then later admitted he knew taking them was wrong.NBC News noticed Snowden weighing in on the Martin arrest:This is huge. Did the FBI secretly arrest the person behind the reports NSA sat on huge flaws in US products? https://t.co/otgOwB5efm-- Edward Snowden (@Snowden) October 5, 2016In other words, he thinks Martin might have been the source for media reports that the NSA knew about critical security flaws in various software products, but kept its knowledge secret -- putting consumers, businesses, and other government entities at risk -- because the NSA wanted to exploit those flaws for its own intelligence-gathering purposes.Interestingly, the New York Times notes that among the ""many terabytes of information"" found in Martin's possession were documents produced in 2014, which is when some major stories accusing the NSA of knowing about critical commercial security flaws were published, concurrent with the public's discovery of the Heartbleed bug.Martin, 51, was charged with felony theft of government information and misdemeanor unauthorized retention of classified information. He appeared at a closed hearing in federal court in Baltimore on Aug. 29 and has been in government custody since, according to court records.

At that time she was still locked in a tougher stance than expected primary opponent Bernie Sanders. Fallon wrote:Circling back around on guns as a follow up to the Friday morning discussion: the Today show has indicated they definitely plan to ask bout guns, and so to have the discussion be more of a news event than her previous times discussing guns, we are going to background reporters tonight on a few of the specific proposals she would support as President - universal background checks of course, but also closing the gun show loophole by executive order and imposing manufacturer liability.Breitbart News has previously reported that Clinton pledged gun control by executive order. She began pushing executive gun control right after the shooting in the Umpqua Community College gun free zone. That incident occurred on October 1, 2015, three days before Fallon's email that Clinton ""would support...closing the gun show loophole by executive order."" This is in line with a Washington Post report that Clinton wants to use executive orders ""to go further than Obama"" went  on gun control.It is interesting to note that the Umpqua Community College gunman passed a background check for his weapons, so Clinton's ""universal background checks"" would have done nothing to stop the attack. Moreover, he did not acquire them at a private sale at a gun show, so any successful executive action against gun shows would have been powerless to stop the attack as well.Her plan to open gun manufacturers to lawsuits by crime victims will not reduce crime either, but it will bankrupt-and eventually end-gun manufacturing in the United States. Senator Bernie Sanders warned of this during the March 6, 2016, Democrat debate, when he said, ""If [gun makers] are selling a product to a person who buys it legally, what you're really talking about is ending gun manufacturing in America.

[05162013 Remarks to Banco Itau.doc, p. 28]In her remarks to Banco Itau, Clinton also denounced the idea of putting up barriers to global trade, a statement which will likely raise concerns with grassroots and working-class voters in her own party. ""We have to resist protectionism, other kinds of barriers to market access and to trade,"" Clinton said.Even though it has gone virtually unreported by corporate media, Breitbart News has extensively documented the Clintons' longstanding support for ""open borders."" Interestingly, as the Los Angeles Times observed in 2007, the Clinton's praise for globalization and open borders frequently comes when they are speaking before a wealthy foreign audiences and donors.In July 2007, Bill Clinton praised the benefits of ""open borders"" and ""easy immigration"" while delivering the keynote address at the 16th Telugu Association of North America (TANA) conference in Washington D.C. to a crowd of thousands of Indian Americans. As the Los Angeles Times reported at the time, Clinton ""drew applause at a conference of 14,000 Indian Americans in Washington as he extolled the benefits of 'open borders, easy travel, easy immigration.'"" It went on to report, ""The same day, he headlined a fundraiser at the conference for his wife's [failed 2008 presidential] campaign.""In a 2003 speech delivered to Yale University, Bill Clinton called for the establishment of a ""global community,"" praised the ""openness of our borders to immigrants,"" and declared that America ""has great obligations to open our borders."" Clinton said that he believes the formation a ""genuine global community""--complete with an ""over-arching system"" to regulate it--to be ""the great mission of the 21st century.""The latest WikiLeaks revelation documenting Hillary Clinton's explicit support for ""open borders"" may pose unique challenges to her campaign, as it means that for months, Clinton's campaign has deliberately sought to mislead the American people about her position on immigration.Clinton's campaign website promoted material insisting that the ""claim that Hillary Clinton supports open borders"" is ""false""- even though, by Clinton's own admission, ""open borders"" is her ""dream.""Clinton's new pushback against publicly labeling herself as for ""open borders"" while clearly championing open border policies is perhaps related to the fact that increasing immigration levels is not a popular policy. According to Pew, an overwhelming 83 percent of the American electorate overall would like to see immigration levels frozen or reduced.Clinton's newly revealed remarks are equally interesting in that they demonstrate corporate media's failure to meaningfully examine or accurately report on Clinton's immigration position.Indeed, for months, while Republican nominee Donald Trump has repeatedly made the case that his opponent supports open borders, many in the media have denounced Trump's assertion as false--without providing any substantive evidence to counter his claim.For instance, Politifact, the Associated Press, CNN, FactCheck.org, and The Washington Post have all tried to argue that it's not true that Clinton supports open borders. In doing so, these ""fact checkers"" have demonstrated that they either don't know what ""open borders"" means, or they are deliberately parroting talking points provided by the Clinton campaign to cover up Clinton's record on the issue.Interestingly, these so-called ""fact checks"" rarely mention how many migrants would be imported into the country under a Hillary Clinton Presidency. While Bill Clinton has described our current immigration policy as one of ""open borders,"" his wife has championed policies that would open our borders even further.Clinton's primary rival Bernie Sanders has explained how ""open borders"" is a radical and fringe position supported by wealthy donors, which hurts working Americans. In a 2015 interview with Vox, Sanders denounced open borders as a ""Koch brothers proposal"" that would essentially amount to ""doing away with the concept of a nation state."" Sanders said:It would make everybody in America poorer--you're doing away with the concept of a nation state, and I don't think there's any country in the world that believes in that. If you believe in a nation state or in a country called the United States or UK or Denmark or any other country, you have an obligation in my view to do everything we can to help poor people. What right-wing people in this country would love is an open-border policy. Bring in all kinds of people, work for $2 or $3 an hour, that would be great for them. I don't believe in that. I think we have to raise wages in this country.By Sanders' argument, by embracing open borders Clinton will ""make everybody in America poorer"" and has essentially adopted the view that there should be ""no United States... [by] doing away with the concept of a nation state.""This is precisely the concern of populist, nation-state conservatives like Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions, who made this very argument. In a USA Today op-ed from May of this year, in which he laid out the case for Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton, Sessions wrote, ""For the first time in a long time, this November will give Americans a clear choice on perhaps the most important issue facing our country and our civilization: whether we remain a nation-state that serves its own people, or whether we slide irrevocably toward a soulless globalism that treats humans as interchangeable widgets in the world market.""*Hillary Clinton Said Her Dream Is A Hemispheric Common Market, With Open Trade And Open Markets. *

He continued, explaining: ""I posted an image to Instagram in the midst of that emotion that I shouldn't have and immediately removed it. It was an extremely poor decision and I apologize for that mistake and for offending people.""After offering his apology, Crowell also pledged to donate his first NFL player's check to the Dallas police foundation. In addition, after a meeting with members of the foundation, some Dallas officers forgave the player for his social media post.""It's important for the police to start opening a dialogue -- just because you did something wrong and bad by all accounts and now you want to talk about it, let's talk about it,"" Sergeant and President of the Dallas Fallen Officer Foundation Demetrick Pennie told Breitbart Texas.Crowell rushed for 706 yards and earned four touchdowns for the Browns last season. He competed in college for the University of Georgia but also found controversy then when a weapons charge led to his dismissal from the team and a transfer to Alabama State.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.

Chuck Grassley in November for Senate and supports the administration's unilateral, illegal decision to protect millions of illegal aliens from deportation.The Sioux City Journal asked Judge if she would support stripping federal aid from jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with immigration officials at the federal level.""How about sanctuary cities?"" the Journal began. ""That gets a lot of discussion and there's been talk about denying federal aid, for example, to cities that have--through policies of their own local laws become sanctuary cities, which in effect means they don't have to talk to or cooperate with federal immigration officials.""""Would you support denying aid to sanctuary cities?"" the paper asked.""Well, you know I am really not clear in my mind what a sanctuary city is, and I guess there are cities that--"" Judge replied, while the Journal explained that California's San Francisco is one.""And why do they qualify--what do they do that makes them a sanctuary city?"" Judge asked. ""I've actually asked my staff the same.""""It's usually through a policy or through a law they pass that they do not and will not--it limits the extent to which they must cooperate with federal immigration officials,"" the Journal explained. ""For whatever reason, they feel it's beneficial for them to not cooperate--they think perhaps that fosters better relationships with that population within their jurisdiction.""""That makes it very difficult then--and things like the Steinle case in San Francisco happened and the woman was murdered,"" the Journal continued. ""The undocumented alien had been released from custody multiple times and ended up murdering someone. Immigration didn't know they had released the person. They were not consulted. San Francisco has a sanctuary policy or law in place that they were not required to do that.""""I guess part of that that I really don't understand is, how they have the authority to not cooperate?"" Judge asked. ""Yeah, I don't understand that.""""Are you familiar with Sarah's Law?"" the paper asked.""No, I'm sorry, I am not,"" Judge said.""Sarah Root, the Iowa college student who was killed in Omaha earlier this year?""""Oh, yes, now refresh--I do remember this,"" Judge said.""Again undocumented, released from custody. There's a bill that's been proposed in Congress to a -- it would essentially require if there was a death or serious injury to someone caused by an undocumented individual that that federal immigration authorities would be required to be notified and they would take custody of that individual If a serious injury or a death resulted,"" the paper replied.""But if you are not familiar with it, it's probably not fair to put you on the spot and ask you if you would support that legislation?""Judge did not give a definitive answer. ""Well, it's certainly something I would look at.""""Several of the sponsors were Senator Grassley and Senator Ernst and Congressman King, because the case involves an Iowa woman,"" the paper continued. ""A 21-year-old college student who was killed and so they have gotten behind that legislation. I was going to ask you if you supported that legislation, but again, if you are not familiar with that legislation then perhaps that isn't a fair question. I would encourage you to--""""I will look at it,"" Judge said.It's remarkable that Judge is unaware of sanctuary cities and even Sarah Root, considering the national uproar surrounding both topics. An illegal alien (""unaccompanied minor"") released into the U.S. interior and into the custody of an illegal alien family member rear-ended Root on January 31 while street-racing drunk, underage, and without a license, right after she graduated from college. ICE determined that Root's killer did not meet ""enforcement priorities,"" and so he vanished shortly after posting bond. His bond was less than what it cost to bury Sarah, her devastated father said.Sarah's Law would require immigration officials to detain illegal aliens suspected of killing or maiming someone.SIGN UP"	['Ernst', 'Grassley']	[]

""Staff have been trying to meet with the College Republicans for the last week to finalize details, but they have not responded to repeated requests.

Federal authorities filed the action just one week to the day before the Texas AG was to represent the Lone Star State and half the states in their fight at the U.S. Supreme Court against President Obama's Administration's executive amnesty order.As reported by Breitbart News, the executive amnesty case was historic because this was only the second time in U.S. history where America's highest court was to decide a challenge brought by a majority of states against the federal government. It was also historic in that it involved the scope of presidential power under the U.S. Constitution.The motion to dismiss filed by lead counsel Matthew T. Martens (Washington, D.C.), Dallas lawyer William B. Mateja, and Frisco lawyer J. Mitchell Little, urged that the federal complaint for securities fraud ""does not allege that [Paxton] made a single false or misleading statement."" The complaint did however, accuse Servergy's co-founder and then-CEO and Chairman William E. Mapp, III, of leading investors to believe that a ""revolutionary new server"" ""was in high demand."" It stated that Mapp falsely claimed that notable companies like Amazon.com and Freescale Semiconductors had pre-ordered the product. This was just one of the misrepresentations alleged by the SEC against Mapp in the complaint.In June Breitbart Texas reported, that Paxton's lawyers, including Martens who had previously served as the chief litigation counsel in the enforcement division at the SEC, filed a motion to dismiss the SEC civil lawsuit (with prejudice). He wrote, ""In short, the SEC's claims against Mr. Paxton are a dramatic overreach and lack any basis in law.""Paxton's lawyers filed the 29-page pleading and urged that the SEC had not claimed that Paxton ever lied or made a misrepresentation, and no one had alleged that they lost money in any of the transactions involving Paxton. The motion also stated that the SEC's argument that Paxton failed to disclose that he could receive a commission for touting securities, and that he had not investigated the company, ran counter to decades of case law precedent that has never required such discussions or actions.Federal regulators say Paxton raised $840,000 for Servergy, a high-tech startup, without telling investors that he was being paid. They alleged Paxton was paid 100,000 shares for bringing on investors in 2011.In the Court's order, the Judge Amos L. Mazzant, III (an Obama appointee) wrote, ""This case is not about whether Paxton had a moral obligation to disclose his financial arrangement with Servergy to potential investors. This case is also not about whether Paxton had some general obligation to disclose his financial arrangement to his investor group. The only issue before the Court is to determine whether the facts as pleaded give rise to a plausible claim under federal securities laws. With that limitation in mind, the Court has determined that under the facts pleaded by the Commission, Paxton did not have a legal obligation to disclose his financial arrangement.""The Court concluded ""that the Complaint has not alleged facts sufficient to support a plausible claim under Sections 17(a) and 17(b) of the Securities Act or Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Exchange Act.""The SEC asked the Court to give it an opportunity to amend its Complaint and the federal judge responded saying that ""While this request does not satisfy the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15, the Court is inclined to allow the Commission to plead additional facts, if any, before it grants the motion and dismisses the Commission's claims against Paxton.""The Court ordered that Paxton's Motion to Dismiss was conditionally granted ""pending the Court's review of the Commission's submission of additional facts."" He granted the Commission ""leave to amend its allegations against Paxton to the extent that it has additional facts that might support a claim under the statutes alleged in the Complaint.""""This is a victory for Ken Paxton. Obviously, we are pleased with the Court's ruling today,"" said Matthew Martens. Bill Mateja, a lawyer on both Paxton's SEC and criminal defense teams added ""now we turn our attention to Ken's exoneration in the state matter where the prosecutor's burden is even higher. The fraud allegations in the SEC case mirror those in the state case.""Any amendment to the Complaint by the Commission was ordered to be filed within 14 days of the October 7th order.The Judge also ordered that ""the Commission must place any new facts not previously alleged in the original Complaint in bold typeface.""Lana Shadwick is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

That's the question the Defeat Crooked Hillary PAC is asking in a new 30-second ad titled, ""Race of a Lifetime.""SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe text of the ad is featured on top of Fox 10 News video footage showing Hillary Clinton audibly coughing and asking, ""Can I get some water?""The Super PAC's call for drug testing the candidates comes just days before Clinton and Trump face off in St. Louis for their second debate on Sunday.The ad comes as part of a new targeting campaign, which will begin running on Friday. The new ads ""are supported by a six-figure ad buy. Each ad will target swing states and undecided voters on Facebook, YouTube and Google,"" the Super PAC writes in a press release.Presumably, neither campaign should have reason to object to drug testing the candidates, as Clinton's campaign has repeatedly insisted that Clinton is in fine health, and Trump has demonstrated his physical stamina with the rigorous campaign schedule he has kept for over a year, in which he addresses thousands of people each day, oftentimes in sweltering heat. It is also well known that Trump's lives a lifestyle that has been completely free of alcohol, cigarettes, drugs, or even coffee.However, in recent weeks -- despite the efforts both by Clinton's campaign and by many in corporate media to dismiss discussion of Clinton's health -- the subject has become a topic of concern.Many among those concerned have pointed to Clinton's chronic coughing episodes, her memory loss, her previous falls, her collapse at a memorial service on the 15th anniversary of 9/11 (followed by her campaign's denial of any health problems, then their claim that it was ""overheating,"" and finally their claim that it was actually pneumonia), the various footage demonstrating her apparent difficulties ascending and descending stairs, and her bizarre appearance and volume in a recent video message to voters in which she shouts at the camera: ""Why aren't I fifty points ahead?""These incidents, in combination with her appearance during recent televised campaign events, have led some to question whether Clinton is being propped up on medications to ""engineer"" an appearance of alertness during widely-watched events. Following the last debate, Dilbert creator Scott Adams wrote that Clinton looked ""drugged, tired [and] sick.""""Clinton looked [to my eyes] as if she was drugged, tired, sick, or generally unhealthy, even though she was mentally alert and spoke well,"" Adams wrote. ""But her eyes were telling a different story. She had the look of someone whose doctors had engineered 90 minutes of alertness for her just for the event. If she continues with a light campaign schedule, you should assume my observation is valid, and she wasn't at 100 percent.""In August, Adams wrote a blog post on ""drug testing presidential candidates."" Adams wrote:Prescription meds change your body... often in substantial ways. When your body changes, your mind follows. The prescription meds says that very thing right on the warning label. Many of them even warn against suicidal thoughts. So if you think prescription meds don't CAUSE thoughts, you are not current with modern science. A person on prescription meds is essentially a chemical cyborg - part human, part science experiment. This brings us to Hillary Clinton. Clinton looks unhealthy to me, and to many observers. And she has had some unexplained episodes that look like leftover brain damage from her concussion, or from a stroke, or something. See Mike Cernovich explain this one. I'm not a doctor, so my medical opinion has zero credibility. But there is certainly a legitimate question here. If voters are not confident in the brain-health of their candidates, that's as big a problem as you can have. Don't act like it doesn't matter. If you do, you're a science-denier. I also think Trump needs to get tested at the same time. He does have a lot of energy, if you know what I mean. At age 70, nearly all adults are on some sort of meds. Let's sort it out. Their meds might not be the type that influence decisions. But I doubt it. I doubt it hard.Prescription meds change your body... often in substantial ways. When your body changes, your mind follows.

Reyes says his company has more than 250 businesses as clients across the U.S. in 48 different states. ""What Trump has done and how he's grown his business resonates with us.""Reyes told Breitbart News:Many business owners are afraid to publically admit that they support Donald Trump because they worry about the negative feedback that their business will receive on social media. Self-proclaimed social justice warriors make it their mission to destroy the businesses of people whom they don't agree with politically. That in turn, leads to businesses owners silencing their own values to protect their employees. The best business owners are those willing to muzzle themselves int the best interest of the families they support.""Every day I'm meeting with the owners of family-owned businesses all the way up to CEOs of multi-billion dollar corporations and we see it constantly across the spectrums,"" he explained, referencing the support for Trump, adding:It's almost to the point where it's comical where they'll say, 'I saw a piece you just wrote about Trump. Close the door,' and I close the door and I think they're going to start yelling at me and instead of yelling at me they go, 'You think he's going to win? Because, I'm behind him.'Reyes said one of his clients admitted to identifying as a Clinton supporter in a survey instead of admitting that he's a Trump supporter, recalling:I had one of the business owners that we work with -- who is a about a $150 million a year company -- and he said, 'You know, I got polled and I told them that I'm voting for Clinton.' I said, ""Since when are you a Clinton supporter? And he goes, 'No, I'm not a Clinton supporter, but we Trump supporters, we don't want to show our hand.'""We're seeing this all over the place,"" Reyes added.He also dismissed the recent report about Trump's tax returns from The New York Times, suggesting Trump claimed a multi-million dollar loss and may not have paid taxes for more than a decade.""Who in their right mind is going to arbitrarily pay more taxes than they have to?"" Reyes mocked. ""Every single person across the country -- as far as business owners -- will sit down with their accountant and go, 'What do I need to do to reduce my tax liability so that I can hire more people?' We don't sit there and go, 'What can I do to pay more taxes?'""Another Connecticut businessman, Chris Walsh, agreed with Reyes that the number of small business owners supporting Trump is higher than expected.""I would be surprised if that number is anywhere south of 80 percent,"" he said during a phone interview with Breitbart News on Friday about small business owners backing the Republican nominee. ""I think you're going to see a much higher percentage of voters voting for Trump than you saw for Romney and McCain.""Walsh recently sold his business, which helped veterans get vehicles at a discount. He said the support  of Trump even in Connecticut -- a typically blue state -- is increasing. ""There's a groundswell like I've never seen.""Walsh recalled going into a liquor store where only one car -- a Subaru -- was parked outside with a Trump sticker. He said he only saw an elderly woman in the store, and when she saw his ""Make America Great Again"" hat, she gave him a thumbs up. He approached her and asked about her bumper sticker.""It's my third one. I've had two ripped off. I've had curses lipsticked on the back of my car, but I don't care -- enough is enough,"" Walsh said the woman told him. ""She said, 'It's time to make America great again.""Although he notes the ""groundswell"" of support for Trump, Walsh acknowledges that Connecticut is in a Democratic region of the country. An Emerson poll from last month shows Clinton with a 15 point lead over Trump in Connecticut.""This corner of the nation is never going to flip red, but I don't feel as a resident of Connecticut that it's not worth my time to go vote like I have in years past,"" Walsh added. ""I think you're going to see a huge turnout.""Many business owners are afraid to publically admit that they support Donald Trump because they worry about the negative feedback that their business will receive on social media.

But the program brought stiff penalties for criminals with guns, even when the gun was simply in criminal possession, whether used in the commission of a crime or not, and crime decreased.On February 10, 1999, The New York Times quoted Mayor Tim Kaine saying, ""In Richmond, there has been an intense need for people to become believers in their own community. High crime has been our psychological downer. But Project Exile is driving the crime down, and that is starting to make Richmonders believe again.""Project Exile was the brainchild of assistant U.S. Attorney David Schiller, and it was heavily promoted and pushed by the NRA. In the first two years of its implementation, ""475 illegal guns"" were recovered, and there were ""indictments against 404 people in gun charges-more than six times the annual average."" The resulting conviction rate was ""86 percent,"" and the ""average prison term [was] more than four and a half years.""Under Project Exile, the number of homicides in Richmond fell to ""78"" in 1998. That was a 36 percent decrease from the year before. The Times described it as ""one of the steepest declines in any city.""In short, Project Exile took criminals off the streets. And when Hillary Clinton picked Kaine as her running mate, some warned that his past support of Project Exile could cause problems for the ticket. For example, Reuters was referencing Project Exile when it described that Kaine embraced ""crime-fighting strategies that have driven up the U.S. prison population and are unpopular in the black community."" Campaign Zero co-founder Sam Sinyangwe said, ""Project Exile broke black families. This is not a benign thing to be for. These measures were not used against white kids in the suburbs with guns, they were used against black kids in the cities.""But Kaine supported Project Exile, and it served him well by lowering crime under his watch.However, the same Kaine who supported Project Exile is now a vocal opponent of stop-and-frisk when Donald Trump suggests using the tactic to target criminals in Chicago. In the transcript of the October 4 vice presidential debate, published by The Washington Post, Kaine said, ""Donald Trump recently said we need to do more stop-and-frisk around the country. That would be a big mistake because it polarizes the relationship between the police and the community."" Kaine also credited the drop in crime during his stint as mayor to ""community policing."" In this, he is criticizing Trump for supporting the kind of policing that actually worked in Richmond, while subsequently claiming a more gentle approach to policing is what worked in Richmond.As The Washington Times observed, ""Tim Kaine didn't tell the whole truth about crime in Richmond.""People are dying at an unprecedented rate in Chicago while Kaine pushes more of the failed ""community policing"" that has proved impotent against criminals.

The poll carries a three percent margin of error with a 95 percent level of confidence.""In 2010, Johnson beat Feingold, 52 percent to 47 percent in what was the Tea Party wave election,"" said Kaplan.""We don't know yet if 2016 will develop into a wave election, but the dynamics of Feingold and Johnson have been locked in for months, and I don't see even a wave saving Johnson,"" he said.In the Oct. 4 Breitbart/Gravis poll, Trump trails his Democratic rival Hillary Rodham Clinton with 43 percent to her 46 percent when the presidential question was asked the second time.Democratic pollster Patrick Caddell told Breitbart News that the 2016 election is still very volatile, so to better measure voter presidential preferences, respondents were asked the question of who they would vote for twice. The first time came in the middle of the survey after some attitudinal questions about the respondents' thoughts on the candidates and general mood, and then at the end of the survey after being asked about several key issues in the 2016 race before asking demographic questions.In the first asking, Clinton led Trump with 48 percent to his 40 percent, Libertarian Gary Johnson was the choice of four percent, and Green Party nominee Jill Stein came in at one percent, he said. Johnson and Stein were unchanged.Inside the details of the senate race poll, Feingold has the support of 95 percent of Clinton voters and 40 percent of Trump voters.Johnson had, earlier in the campaign, said he would campaign with Trump regularly.""Stump with Trump?"" Johnson told CNN when asked if he would campaign with Trump way back in March. ""Just because it rhymes: It'd be the Ronald (and) the Donald.""But Johnson has not campaigned with Trump at all, although he will on Saturday.The poll was conducted with random automated phone calls and a Gravis Internet panel of cell phone users. Results were weighted to match a proprietary turnout model. The poll carries a margin of error of three percent with a 95 percent level of confidence.SIGN UP"	['Paul', 'Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

He said ""46 states just call themselves states. But four of us -- Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky and Massachusetts -- we're kind of, a little bit more aspirational. We don't call ourselves states; that's just a dotted line, a boundary, a political subdivision. We call ourselves commonwealth."" He added, ""the wealth we hold, we hold in common. We're stronger together. And that's why Hillary Clinton chose that as the theme for the campaign.He proceeded to blast Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump for naming a book he published five months after announcing his presidential bid, Crippled America.""This is the book that Donald Trump wrote when he decided to run for president. The book is called Crippled America. Crippled America,"" Kaine said. ""First, that phrase is offensive to me... but even getting by that, this is a vision about this country that is negative, gloom and doom, blame America first.""Kaine noted that he ""hated to give [Trump] a royalty but I wanted to motivate myself so I bought a copy"" of his book.At that same moment, the camera zoomed out to show a faded, grey t-shirt with ""The Cover Up Clintons"" written on it with a black Sharpie pen being held up by someone in the audience. The t-shirt also had written on it ""Research #FileGate #ChinaGate #TravelGate #PardonGate.""Kaine proceeded to comment on Trump's image on the cover of the book: ""He chose it himself, sitting in a penthouse at the top of a very big tower, frowning down at everything around him. This is he what he thinks of the United States of America, or he wouldn't have called him book Crippled America.""Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again,"" has been a reaction to his goals of rebuilding the United States into a stronger nation following years of subpar foreign and domestic policy.""I don't see what Donald Trump sees. And I don't think this is who we are, folks,"" Kaine said. Trump has since renamed the title of his book to Great Again: How to Fix Our Crippled America.""You can change the title of your book, but you're not going to change who you are, Donald Trump,"" Kaine told the crowd. ""And I think we know who you are. We know who you are.""The Virginia Senator also touched upon American production, lauding Carnegie Mellon ""as a real center of America's manufacturing."" He announced that he and Clinton are creating a plan Invest ""$10 billion in a make it in America manufacturing plan.""He discussed his and Clinton's plan to make in state college tuition free for families making less than $125,000 a year and work towards ""changing the rules"" so that individuals who currently have debt can refinance it. ""Do you know that in our country right now, it is easier for Donald Trump to refinance the loan on his jet, than it is for any of you to refinance your student loan debt? And there is something fundamentally wrong about that. And if we have the honor to serve we are going to change that to make it easier for you.""During a talk to the Steel Workers Union in Philadelphia the evening before, Kaine told the crowd about how he had told his parents, ""Hey Mom and Dad, why don't you travel with me after the debate? I have a plane with my name on it now.""Kaine also noted that he and Clinton have a deal to target tax relief to middle class families and small businesses. ""That's where two-thirds of American jobs come from... small businesses are the engine of job growth. That's what we want to do,"" Kaine said.Clinton, like former presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), has said she ""absolutely"" will support a $15 minimum wage hike. Many small businesses have complained that this increase will result in the loss of business because they won't be able to afford maintaining a staff with those rates.Kaine completed his talk by telling the crowd that he and Clinton hold the winning ticket.""This is my ninth race. I'm 8 and 0 and I'm going to be 9 and 0 on November 8. I'm gonna give you a little preview: I am not gonna lose this one,"" Kaine said. ""I'm kind of like a rabbit's foot: for good luck,"" he said, half-joking that he's ""barely likable enough"" due to the narrow margin he wins by in Virginia which ""is not the bluest state in the bunch... I am the underdog until they call me the winner. That's the way we have got to think.""Pennsylvania is a swing state. ""Donald Trump knows, as we know too, that he's got to win Pennsylvania if he wants to be president. And you know what? We're not going to let that happen. We're not going to let that happen.""A poll conducted by Franklin & Marshall late last month indicated that of likely Pennsylvania voters under the age of 35, 55 percent support Clinton while 19 percent are for Trump. A Rasmussen Reports poll released on Tuesday shows Clinton and Trump tied nationally, and in a dead heat, following the first presidential debate.

That means it's really bad,"" Fugate said.Fugate went on to explain that a Waffle House Index yellow alert means the Waffle House is open for business but serving a restricted menu, depending on supplies and whether the location has sufficient power to go full service. And, finally, a Waffle House green status means the restaurant is open and serving its full menu.The company has reported that all locations in evacuation areas are already scheduled to be closed. ""We're a 24-hour restaurant, so oddly enough shutting down is a big deal for us,"" Pat Warner, a Waffle House vice president, told Fox News.But the restaurant executive was quick to point out that his chain will be open for business anywhere conditions allow.""A lot of times, especially after a big storm, we're the only ones still open because we've got generators,"" Warner added. ""Right after storms, business is brisk. We have a lot of people come in and are only able to get their first hot meal at a Waffle House.""Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.SIGN UP"	['Warner']	[]
28	28	http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/07/second-presidential-debate-five-questions-expect/	Second Presidential Debate: Five Questions to Expect	"The second presidential debate of the 2016 election will be held at Washington University in St. Louis on Sunday at 9 p.m. Eastern, and may be the most decisive of the three debates.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERDemocratic nominee Hillary Clinton was widely seen as the winner of the first debate, and could hurt her opponent's chances if she goads him into a serious error or gaffe. But Republican nominee Donald Trump has bounced back in the polls, and is riding the momentum of his running mate's strong performance in the vice presidential debate. If Trump turns in a solid performance on Sunday, he could sprint to catch Clinton at the finish.The moderators of the town hall-style debate will be Martha Raddatz of ABC News and Anderson Cooper of CNN. Both lean left, and both can be expected to be tougher on Trump than on Clinton.Here are five questions that both Trump and Clinton should expect to face, either from the moderators or -- in some form -- from the participants in the town hall, whose questions will be pre-screened.1. With Hurricane Matthew battering the Atlantic coast, what will you do about climate change? The question makes no scientific sense, because Hurricane Matthew has nothing to do with climate change. In fact, until this year, no hurricanes had hit the U.S. in more than ten years, confounding the predictions of climate alarmists. But the question will be asked, and is designed to test Trump against the liberal climate orthodoxy. (Clinton's answer will be the usual boilerplate, coupled with a charge of ""denialism"" against Trump).Trump will have to thread the needle carefully. Without denying climate change as a whole, he will have to note that shutting down the coal industry, as Clinton wants to do, cannot be the answer. He should also note that he personally visited Louisiana this summer to visit flood victims, while Clinton hobnobbed on Martha's Vineyard.2. Both of you have high disapproval ratings. How will you be a role model for America's children? That question, or something like it, will be another veiled attack on Trump, since Clinton is a role model by default for being the first female nominee for president from a major party, no matter how poor a candidate she may be. Expect Clinton to bring out the same attack lines that feature in her campaign commercials, and which her running mate pounded at the vice presidential debate.The question gives Trump an opportunity to score points off Clinton for her many scandals. But the best response is for Trump for to point to his own children -- especially his daughter Ivanka -- who are successful, poised, and his best character witnesses.3. Hundreds of thousands may die in Aleppo, the latest in a brutal civil war. What should we do about Syria? Expect this question to come from Anderson Cooper, who likes to show his foreign policy chops. It is the question neither candidate wants to answer, since the problem cannot really be solved short of war with Iran and confrontation with Russia. Clinton has a standard answer, which is to talk about continuing the Obama administration's fight against ISIS (such as it is). She may try to claim she wanted to do more about Syria as Secretary of State but was overruled.If she does, Trump should not let her off the hook: if she really cared about Syria, she ought to have resigned. As for his own policy, his strongest point is his criticism of Arab countries for doing everything to stoke the fighting and nothing to help the refugees. He should pledge to stop that.4. The economy continues to create jobs, and household incomes rose last year. How will you improve on that? In the first debate, the moderator painted a rosy picture of Obama's economic record. Clinton, who proposes to continue Obama's policies, but with an even greater focus on inequality (if that is even possible), will rattle off her talking points about raising the minimum wage and taxing the rich.Trump, who pushed back in the first debate by noting that the stock market is in a bubble and that Clinton has never created a real job in her life, should offer a better response this time, with three parts. First, he should talk about the Americans whom he has met on the campaign trail who are suffering in the Obama-Clinton economy and who are uncertain about the future. Second, he should bring up Obamacare, which has helped make this recovery the slowest since World War II, and which Clinton supports completely. And third, he should note that Clinton's policies -- higher taxes, higher fuel prices, more unskilled illegal aliens, and more needless regulations -- will make the economy even worse.5. I'm a veteran who lost friends in war. How can I trust either of you to be commander-in-chief? At least one question will -- and probably should -- go to a soldier, or a soldier's family, to present the ""commander-in-chief"" test. In this case, the question will also allow CNN and ABC to revive the Khizr Khan controversy, which marked the low point for Trump in the general election. Clinton will emphasize her experience in office, however dubious. She may even recycle her running mate's line that when she took office as Secretary of State, Osama bin Laden was still alive -- to which Trump should answer: yes, and so were Ambassador Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, and Tyrone Woods.In addition to hammering her over Benghazi, and her lies to the bereaved families, Trump should borrow his own running mate's tactics and remind Clinton of the failed Russian ""reset,"" the disaster in Iraq, and the awful Iran deal. He must also make a promise: though he may not have served in the military, he will never sleep when there are Americans in danger, and Americans risking their lives to save them.Joel B.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFrom Politico:The two former presidential aides, alongside fellow White House alums Tommy Vietor and Jon Lovett, are known as the quintessential ""Obama bros"" -- a reference to the largely-male group of young, hard-working (and hard-partying) operatives who helped Obama knock off Clinton in 2008, then followed him into the White House. Once among the toughest Clinton critics, they have become a unique and seemingly ubiquitous clique this election, manning their own bomb-throwing spin room for Clinton. With big followings on Twitter and a popular political podcast, ""Keepin it 1600,"" they act as wingmen for Clinton's official spin shop -- freer to drop bombs on Trump than her more constrained, chain-of-command-bound Brooklyn team....For Favreau, at least, there is some penance driving him, in addition to his gut-level fear of Trump. ""I started off my political career not liking her very much at all,"" he said of Clinton. ""I developed a very different view of her in the White House, and thought we might have helped contribute, during the 2008 race, to the caricature of her that so many people have right now."" Today, he calls her ""an extraordinarily talented, brilliant public servant who should be president.""Read the rest here. SIGN UP"	['Clinton', 'Trump', 'Obama']	[]
