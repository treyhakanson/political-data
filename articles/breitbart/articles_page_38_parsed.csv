According to the latest Breitbart/Gravis poll, when given the choice of whether you should vote for a major party candidate or vote your conscience, 44% of Clinton voters said you should vote your conscience,"" Caddell explained.Even before the FBI director's dramatic announcement on Friday, the ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll indicated that ""loosely affiliated or reluctant Clinton supporters""-- which includes white women and young voters under the age of 30-- seem to be floating off and ""look less likely to vote.""Caddell explained that the polling data suggests ""there are many people who are ambivalent about Clinton who don't want to vote for Trump. Given these new revelations from WikiLeaks and the re-intensity of the concern regarding the corruption of her emails, these ambivalent voters need a place to go and Jill Stein--being not only a progressive woman, but an honest progressive woman--is the obvious choice for so many of these voters, particularly for those who supported Bernie Sanders.""Indeed, nearly 60 percent of voters-- including 43 percent of Democrats-- believe America needs a third major political party, according to a Gallup poll released late last month.As one former Bernie Sanders supporter told Breitbart News, ""It's come to this: voting for Hillary Clinton is voting for the lesser of two evils. But voting for the lesser of two evils is still voting for evil, and I'm tired of voting for evil. That's why I'm voting for Jill Stein.""This sentiment has been echoed by Stein herself who has argued, ""it's time to reject the lesser of two evils and stand up for the greater good.""Stein seems ready to capitalize on the FBI's announcement as well as the steady stream of WikiLeaks revelations that have exposed, what Stein has characterized as, the Clinton camp's ""hostility"" to progressives.""The FBI has re-opened the Clinton investigation. Will the American people rise up and vote for honest change?"" Stein asked on Friday, via Twitter.The FBI has re-opened the Clinton investigation.

No thanks. #InvestYourVote. #VoteGreen. https://t.co/AxZxRxK122-- Green Party US (@GreenPartyUS) October 28, 2016Some have suggested that Clinton's camp is already quietly concerned about Stein's potential ability to peel off some of Clinton's more reluctant liberal voters. The Inquisitr's pro-Bernie Sanders columnist Caitlin Johnstone has argued that the increased attacks against Stein leveled by Clinton's allies in corporate media is evidence of the Clinton camp's concern. Johnstone writes:Attack editorials and smear pieces about Stein have been churned out by Clinton-allied media like cheap t-shirts at a Bangladeshi sweat shop since well before the Green Party convention, but lately, the frenzied attacks are getting even louder and more desperate... Jill Stein, if you haven't been following, is the only candidate on the ballot who has never been a Republican, the only candidate on the ballot who doesn't hate progressives, and the only candidate on the ballot pushing an actual progressive agenda. That means she's going to be pulling votes from people who would otherwise support Hillary 'candidates must have a public position and a private position' Clinton, who is currently pretending to care about progressives so they'll give her the power to privatize social security and start a war with Russia. [...] If Hillary's lead has swelled to insurmountability, why have the attacks on Jill Stein increased instead of decreased? Is she taking far more votes from Clinton than the Nate Silvers are letting us know? Or is it broader than that? Is it simply that in this era of WikiLeaks, alternative media, and widespread internet access, too many people are opening their eyes and looking toward true rebels like Jill Stein? Are they so desperate to keep the progressives from taking over their party or replacing it that they need to grasp at straws by sponsoring hit pieces attacking her...Clinton's strained relationship with progressives has been well documented and could present Stein- who has demonstrated a remarkable ability to articulately prosecute the progressive case against Clinton- with an opening, especially as polling reveals a significant chunk of Clinton voters believe voting their conscience ought to trump voting for a major political party.As Politico reported in a piece titled ""WikiLeaks poisons Hillary's relationship with left"":Some of the left's most influential voices and groups are taking offense at the way they and their causes were discussed behind their backs by Clinton and some of her closest advisers in the emails, which swipe liberal heroes and causes as ""puritanical,"" ""pompous"", ""naive"", ""radical"" and ""dumb,"" calling some ""freaks,"" who need to ""get a life."" [...] among progressive operatives, goodwill for Clinton -- and confidence in key advisers featured in the emails including John Podesta, Neera Tanden and Jake Sullivan -- is eroding...Even before the FBI's announcement, many noted that it was becoming increasingly difficult to view a vote for Clinton as anything other than a vote to continue the worst aspects of political corruption.As columnist Kim Strassel recently wrote, the one thing in this election of which one can be certain is that ""a Hillary Clinton presidency will be built, from the ground up, on self-dealing, crony favors, and an utter disregard for the law.""As such, ""anyone who pulls the lever for Mrs. Clinton takes responsibility for setting up the nation for all the blatant corruption that will follow,"" Strassel concludes.""She just doesn't have a whole lot of integrity,"" said far-left progressive Cornel West.West endorsed Stein over Clinton explaining Stein is ""the only progressive woman in the race.""""The Clinton train-- [of] Wall Street, security surveillance, militaristic-- is not going in the same direction I'm going,"" West told Bill Maher earlier this year.She's a neoliberal... [I] believe neoliberalism is a disaster when it comes to poor people and when it comes to people in other parts of the world dealing with U.S. foreign policy and militarism. Oh, absolutely.

There is also a sense that the Clinton policies helped produce the right-wing populism that we're seeing now in the country. And we think she's going to come to the rescue? That's not going to happen.""It's too easy to view him [Trump] as an isolated individual and bash him,"" West told Maher. ""He's speaking to the pain in the country because white, working class brothers have been overlooked by globalization, by these trade deals""- trade deals which Stein also opposes.Stein has railed against the passage of TPP, which she and her party have described as ""NAFTA on steroids"" that would ""enrich wealthy corporations by exporting jobs and pushing down wages."" They have argued that the deal essentially amounts to a ""global corporate coup"" that ""would give corporations more power than nations"" by letting them ""challenge our laws"".#ImVoting4JillBecause she is the only positive choice for our children's future #votegreen #Election2016 #JillStein @DrJillStein pic.twitter.com/ui1RsqQyrz-- Beebz the Squirrel (@SquirrelBeebz) October 25, 2016Stein is against the ""massive expanding wars,"" ""the meltdown of the climate,"" ""the massive Wall Street bailouts,"" and ""the offshoring of our jobs.""Pointing to Clinton's ""dangerous and immoral"" militarism, Stein has warned that ""a vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for war"" and has explained how under a Clinton presidency, ""we could very quickly slide into nuclear war"" or could start an air-war with Russia.""No matter how her staff tries to rebrand her"" Clinton is ""not a progressive,"" Stein has said--rather Clinton is a ""corporatist hawk"" that ""surrounds herself with people who are hostile progressives"" such as Debbie Wasserman Schultz ""after she sabotaged Bernie [Sanders].""

Even that number is described as a ""significant overcount,"" because the TAA doesn't count every lost manufacturing job.""New Mexico ranchers lost out too. U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico of cattle - New Mexico's top ag product - fell 59 percent in the first 22 years of NAFTA,"" the Trump campaign argues.In a related criticism, the U.S. Free Trade Agreement with South Korea is said to have reduced American exports of dairy products to that country by 88 percent, while the increased trade deficit with Korea was large enough to account for the loss of 102,500 U.S. jobs in just four years.(It should be noted that the relationship between trade deficits and U.S. jobs lost is a matter of enormous contention - perhaps the single most hotly disputed issue between supporters and critics of free trade. An example of the argument that trade deficits kill American jobs in a relentless, predictable manner can be found here, while an argument against that proposition is here.)Having made the argument that trade deficits like the one with South Korea wipe out domestic jobs, the Trump campaign warns New Mexico voters that ""the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) that Hillary supports will kill many more New Mexico jobs, and expose New Mexico to costly litigation.""""The TPP grants special rights to 81 foreign corporations to sue New Mexico before secret international tribunals,"" the Trump statement explains. ""These panels can require New Mexico's taxpayers to pay unlimited sums for the corporations' loss of expected future profits. These foreign corporations need only convince the lawyers that a U.S. or New Mexico law violates their TPP rights. Their decisions are not subject to appeal and the amount they can award has no limit.""Clinton is, at the moment, supposedly critical of TPP, after previously hailing it as the ""gold standard"" for trade deals. The WikiLeaks revelations leave little doubt that Clinton is still secretly in favor of TPP, but felt obliged to pretend otherwise (and force her ""uncomfortable"" staff to play along) until after the election.Clinton's pretense was necessary because a substantial portion of Democrat voters dislikes TPP... and the provision for international tribunals mentioned by Trump is one of the specific provisions they dislike the most.As one prominent elected Democrat wrote, in a February 2015 op-ed for the Washington Post:One strong hint is buried in the fine print of the closely guarded draft. The provision, an increasingly common feature of trade agreements, is called ""Investor-State Dispute Settlement,"" or ISDS. The name may sound mild, but don't be fooled. Agreeing to ISDS in this enormous new treaty would tilt the playing field in the United States further in favor of big multinational corporations. Worse, it would undermine U.S. sovereignty.ISDS would allow foreign companies to challenge U.S. laws -- and potentially to pick up huge payouts from taxpayers -- without ever stepping foot in a U.S. court. Here's how it would work. Imagine that the United States bans a toxic chemical that is often added to gasoline because of its health and environmental consequences. If a foreign company that makes the toxic chemical opposes the law, it would normally have to challenge it in a U.S. court. But with ISDS, the company could skip the U.S. courts and go before an international panel of arbitrators. If the company won, the ruling couldn't be challenged in U.S. courts, and the arbitration panel could require American taxpayers to cough up millions -- and even billions -- of dollars in damages.If that seems shocking, buckle your seat belt. ISDS could lead to gigantic fines, but it wouldn't employ independent judges. Instead, highly paid corporate lawyers would go back and forth between representing corporations one day and sitting in judgment the next. Maybe that makes sense in an arbitration between two corporations, but not in cases between corporations and governments. If you're a lawyer looking to maintain or attract high-paying corporate clients, how likely are you to rule against those corporations when it's your turn in the judge's seat?The Democrat who wrote that fiery critique was Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).One strong hint is buried in the fine print of the closely guarded draft.

Maggie Hassan, 49.1% to 27% -- again, within the margin of error.Inside Sources reports:While Ayotte's disagreements with Trump appear to be having a minimal effect on the race for Senate, perhaps the issue that could ultimately determine the election is the decision by Hassan to tie herself closely to the top of the Democratic ticket.

22	22	http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/31/hillary-clinton-email-scandal-explained/	Hillary Clinton Email Scandal Explained	"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Hillary Clinton is in the spotlight over the worst scandal for a presidential candidate since Watergate.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe FBI has a search warrant for Clinton aide Huma Abedin's laptop, obtained Sunday night after new emails surfaced in the law enforcement investigation of Abedin's husband Anthony Weiner for allegedly sexting with a minor.The Hillary Clinton email scandal can seem complicated. But it's easy to understand. Here is the full story:Hillary Clinton set up a private email server, and a private email network for herself and her family and Abedin. Doing so could prevent her emails from being ""accessible"" to the federal government, not to mention Congress.The private network allowed Clinton, Abedin, and aides Cheryl Mills and Jake Sullivan to swap emails with the Clinton Foundation, various world leaders, and Doug Band's global consulting firm Teneo Holdings, where Abedin also worked during her time at the State Department. This would have been problematic, considering Clinton's 2009 ethics agreement, leaked on Cryptome, in which she vowed not to coordinate with the Clinton Foundation.The FBI investigation began with one simple premise: that Hillary Clinton violated the Espionage Act of 1913 by allowing national defense information to be ""lost, stolen, abstracted, or destroyed"" through ""gross negligence."" Clinton team emails have now ended up in the hands of Julian Assange -- a man who lives sequestered in an Ecuadorian embassy -- and in the hands of detectives in the Anthony Weiner sexting case.Both Clinton and Abedin face the possibility of additional charges, including perjury and obstruction of justice, for contradicting sworn statements and telling falsehoods to the FBI, not to mention Congress. The photograph of Abedin crying on the Clinton campaign plane after the FBI announced that it was re-opening the case -- with Clinton standing by -- will linger in the American political consciousness:Huma Abedin crying on plane as Clinton shows true colors staring in hate as she finds out about FBIinvestigation.pic.twitter.com/lsHmMQ0Prq-- Adjusted Well (@Adjustedwell) October 29, 2016Huma Abedin has reason to be nervous. In fact, she was the one who came up with the idea for Clinton to use a private email server, according to former Bill Clinton aide Justin Cooper's testimony in the case. Cooper was Clinton-World's go-to computer guy, and he set up Abedin's own personal account on clintonemail.com.Hillary's 2008 campaign IT specialist Bryan Pagliano labored for months in a room on K Street in Washington, D.C., building the server for Clinton to use.Hillary Clinton kicked off her State Department career in Foggy Bottom in January 2009 with a private Apple server, then switched to Pagliano's handcrafted server in March 2009.Huma Abedin later told the FBI that she didn't even know about Clinton's private server when she was at the State Department, and Bryan Pagliano pleaded the Fifth.Hillary Clinton claimed that her server was kept in the basement of her Chappaqua, New York home. But really, the server was stored at a Clinton-owned office in Midtown Manhattan, where it shared physical space with the Clinton Foundation's server. Hillary's homebrew server was operating on the same email network as the Foundation's server and the server for Chelsea Clinton's office.Hillary Clinton went to great lengths to hide the fact that she was using a private email server. She emailed with President Obama while Obama was using a pseudonym. She kept her own State Department IT Help Desk in the dark about her secret email activities, because her private email account got flagged when she tried to send emails to her own staff. ""It bounced back. She called the email help desk at state (I guess assuming u had state email) and told them that. They had no idea it was YOU,"" Abedin told her. Clinton even paid a firm in Jacksonville called ""Perfect Privacy LLC"" to plug in phony owner names for her email network on Internet databases.The server had an open webmail portal, making it easily vulnerable to run-of-the-mills hackers. James Comey noted evidence showing hacks by ""hostile actors."" Capitol Hill sources speak in hushed tones about the ""Russian Files,"" which are said to include information about a Russian hack. Clinton was warned of a security ""vulnerability"" on her BlackBerry on her first official trip to China, and the State Department told her to stop using it. But Clinton decided to keep using it. She told a private audience in a paid speech that her BlackBerry was under attack constantly by the Chinese and Russians.Hillary Clinton had a lot of classified information on that server.""There was nothing marked classified on my emails, either sent or received,"" Hillary Clinton told the House Benghazi Committee in sworn testimony in 2015.""That's not true,"" FBI director James Comey told Congress, referring to Clinton's sworn statement. Comey's first investigation found 113 emails that had classified information in them, including emails that were clearly marked classified when they were sent. Clinton, for her part, claimed that she didn't know that a ""C"" marking on an email meant that it was classified or confidential.Hillary's statement to the Benghazi Committee is one of multiple statements that could open Clinton up to charges of perjury or obstruction of justice. And it is one of many areas in which Breitbart News led the media in exposing a Clinton falsehood. But Hillary Clinton did not simply expose national secrets. She put people's lives in jeopardy.Hillary Clinton posted and shared the names of CIA-protected intelligence sources on her private email server, including a defense attache and other covert U.S. agents working on matters including Iran and the Taliban and Pakistan.Clinton's server contained at least five different emails revealing the exact location or travel plans of U.S. Libyan ambassador Chris Stevens, who was murdered in the 2012 Benghazi attack. Stevens' killers, of course, knew exactly where he was going to be when they got him.When all was said and done, Clinton deleted thousands of emails with a software program called ""BleachBit."" Bill Clinton's former aide Justin Cooper came back into the picture to deal with at least two of Clinton's 13 mobile devices. Cooper smashed them with a hammer or broke them in half, according to the FBI. The server itself was shipped off to an obscure company in Denver called Platte River Networks.Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin used their private server while running the State Department.

On these issues, the majority of the voters agree with the positions held by Trump, including at least 20 percent of Clinton supporters.If Trump can make the election a referendum on the big issues, he would elevate himself above the head-to-head personality contest, Caddell says.Another benefit for Trump, if he can elevate his campaign above the nasty personal fight with Clinton is that he will activate the latent emotions that are in sync with Trump on the issues.Throwing a wrench in any analysis of the campaign in its final days is the early voting practices in different states, he said.Caddell told Boyle he is not a fan of early balloting, which is booming across the country.In many states, early voting-a combination of absentee ballots submitted by mail and early voting in-person-now accounts for more votes than those cast in person on election day.""I just want to make a political point, the early voting? It is the most dangerous, stupid thing I have ever seen in my life,"" he said.Caddell said it was a classic example of somebody deciding: ""Let's do something good without thinking about the consequences.""It would not be a problem to have a weekend of voting or 24 hours of voting, he said. ""But, weeks in advance? It walks right into the problem we have now.""Early voters are hit with remorse, when they hear news that makes them change their mind before the election, he told Boyle, who was hosting the program on SiriusXM ""The Patriot"" channel 125.They realize: ""If only I had known then,"" he said.Early voting corrupts the process that voters and campaigns should be going through, he said.""The reason you have an Election Day is to culminate an election with the moment of decision,"" he said.He says voters already knew that Clinton was corrupt, but as the media focused on Trump and his problems, the feelings about Clinton and her corrupt enterprise became latent, just as early voting was starting.Caddell said in all the Breitbart/Gravis polls there is a solid majority of respondents saying that FBI Director James Comey was wrong when he recommended July 5 that the Department of Justice decline to prosecute the former first lady.Comey told Congress Friday that there are significant new findings related to the investigation into how Clinton handled sensitive electronic communications, while she was the secretary of state-such a situation activates latent emotions in the voters and leads them to change the mind. But, with early voting, the ballots are already cast.Left-wing pundits and Democratic surrogates have been going on TV to say that the voters have already factored in Clinton's corruption, so the new FBI revelation will have not effect, he said.""They say it is already baked-in,"" he said. ""Whether it is baked-in or not, the question is how much of the ingredients in the cake it becomes. It is expandable. This is a coalescing point for people-and to think that this is not going to have an impact? You might as well go to Mars.""For almost two years, the so-called experts have been wrong about Trump, he said. ""They have never understood the revolt of the American people going on.""The country is bound and determined to overthrow the existing order, whether it was Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) on the Democratic side or Trump on the Republican side, Caddell said.SIGN UP"	['Sanders', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Boyle']	[]

Jim Jordan of Ohio tells Breitbart News that he would oppose efforts by Rep. Devin Nunes (R.-CA) to weaken or delete the Motion to Vacate the Chair in the House Rules.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""I  strongly oppose any efforts to make changes to, or do away with, the Motion to Vacate the Chair,"" Jordan says. He was the first leader of the House Freedom Caucus and the last chairman of the Republican Study Committee, before it become part of the GOP leadership team.Former Speaker John Boehner resigned from Congress and on Oct. 29, 2015 was replaced by Speaker Paul Ryan. Boehner had been put on notice that his time was up by a motion to vacate the chair filed in July 2015 by Rep. Mark Meadows (R.-NC), but Meadows did not take the floor to force the vote. The North Carolina congressman, along with other conservatives, declined to press their case, when Congress returned from summer recess, after Boehner announced that he would step down.The change to the rule, proposed by Nunes, would add another step to the process of removing a speaker.As the rule now reads, the motion is a privileged motion. Thus if a congressman is recognized on the House floor he has the ""privilege"" to call for an immediate vote on continued tenure of the Speaker of the House. The motion cannot be amended, nor can there be debate. If a majority of the House supports the motion, the speaker is removed and a Speaker Pro Tempore is chosen.House rules are based on Jefferson's Manual, a system of parliamentary procedures that were formally incorporated as the chamber's official rules and procedures in 1837, 11 years after Thomas Jefferson's death.Nunes, who is the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, wants the rule changed, so that before a member can take the floor to make his privileged motion, he must first have the approval of his own party's caucus.Although in theory the speaker is elected from the whole House, in practice the candidates for speaker are first nominated by their own party's caucus and then presented to the whole House. The vote is pro forma because the majority party has always supported the winner of its caucus nomination.The effect of the Nunes proposal would be eliminate the possibility of factions from each party combining to remove a speaker, since the floor vote is predicated on the party-only vote.Jack Langer, the communications director for Nunes, told Breitbart News the California congressman is looking to make the running of the chamber more smooth, when he formally files his amendment to House rules after this session.""He's planning on submitting it for consideration as part of the rules package for the next Congress,"" Langer said.""The goal is to prevent the House's functioning from being severely disrupted at any given moment due to a whim or grievance by a single Member,"" he said. ""If the party is so dissatisfied with the Speaker that it wants to replace him, the motion would still allow for that - but it's reasonable to require majority support within the party for that kind of drastic action.""Perhaps mindful of his own path to the speaker's gavel, Ryan attempted to make the elimination of the motion a condition of his agreeing to stand for speaker.At the time, one week before his ascension, his spokesman Brendan Buck told reporters the privilege to call for a vote that would remove a speaker was like a weapon pointed at the speaker and that such a weapon would make it impossible for any speaker to succeed.Eventually, Ryan relented and ran for speaker without changes to the House rules, but now one year later, his ally Nunes is taking up the cause.Of course, Nunes is not just a Ryan ally, but also a sworn enemy of House conservatives, whom he once described as ""lemmings with suicide vests.""Jordan said he revered how the House still follows parliamentary rules penned by author of the Declaration of Independence.""This centuries-old procedural motion is a critical accountability tool for the rank-and-file members of the House,"" the congressman said.""If it was good enough for Thomas Jefferson, it's good enough for the 115th Congress.""SIGN UP"	['Buck', 'Paul', 'Jordan', 'Meadows', 'Nunes']	[]

""We are pleased to learn that the Vice President will follow the lead of the Trumpocrats, putting country before party by extending a hand to Donald Trump. There are millions of Democrats and Independents who are supporting Trump and it looks like we have a real shot at winning. It's clear that the Vice President realizes that.""In an interview on CNN over the weekend with Michael Smerconish, Biden promised that if Trump wins the election he would work with him as president of the United States and help him lead the country.""If he wins, I'll extend a hand,"" Biden told Smerconish. ""He would be president of the United States of America, period. I pray that doesn't happen. I want that -- I want Hillary to be president, but whomever is the president is president of the United States of America.""Biden added that he plans to ""stay involved"" and ""no matter who wins"" he he will ""reach out"" and work with the winner, even if it's Trump.The move was a classy one, Rickers said in a follow-up appearance on Breitbart News Sunday on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125. Rickers, before launching the Trumpocrats PAC this cycle, was a supporter of now Democratic nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton's Democratic primary opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. He was a delegate to the 2012 Democratic National Convention for President Barack Obama and was a staffer at one time to Clinton's running mate Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA). But now he's backing Trump for president.Rickers said Biden's promise to work with a President Trump ""is a punch to the gut to Hillary Clinton's people because they don't want anybody that says that kind of thing.""""We ought to applaud Joe Biden for saying that he's going to actually do something positive, whereas the Clintons all they want to do is tear somebody apart,"" Rickers said.The fact that Hillary Clinton herself hasn't made such a promise to work with Trump if elected--and that many other top Democrats haven't--is not so classy, Rickers said.""The Clintons are just all about the Clintons, man,"" Rickers said.They're just going to do all they can do--we are in for another crazy 10 days or 9 days or whatever it is and they are going to throw everything at it and the kitchen sink.

Trump is sprinting into the final full week of the campaign as his opponent Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton is struggling.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFederal law enforcement officials are taking another look at her emails, held on a home-brew server that was set up in violation of State Department guidelines, and former FBI officials confirm the nature of the current and ongoing deep dive investigation into the Clinton Foundation. Meanwhile, Trump is surging in the polls and zoning in on several states that political observers previously thought were unattainable for the billionaire businessman.""This is big,"" Jason Miller, Donald Trump's senior communications adviser, tells Breitbart News Sunday on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125.The news that came out on Friday with the FBI reopening their investigation is big. The fact that 11 days before this contest they found it so extraordinary that they need to go and put this out there I think really spoke to the fact that they found something. So what we found out then today is that there were upwards of 650,000 emails. Now, I'm sure you probably have a lot of emails on your laptop--I'm not sure how many--650,000 is a lot. But 650,000--that's a big number. They think thousands, there were thousands of back and forth communications between Huma Abedin and Secretary Clinton, all tied into State Department official business. Now, taking a step back, not only is there an issue here with confidential and classified, top secret information that's being shared, but the other thing to keep in mind that we don't know yet and this is what we'll find out depending on how much comes out before the election we just don't know, but what obstruction of justice issues are going to come out? Clearly this entire email setup was done to get around the confines of having to go through the government so people couldn't get a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act request] and find out what was going on. As we saw, this all ties back in to the news that came out on Wednesday and Thursday about 'Clinton, Inc.,' and the $66 million pay-to-play scheme that Doug Band set up.LISTEN TO SENIOR TRUMP ADVISER JASON MILLER ON BREITBART NEWS SUNDAY The flailing Clinton campaign sent surrogates all over Sunday shows earlier in the day to try to regain control of the narrative but failed miserably. Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager, admitted to Fox News Sunday's Chris Wallace that Clinton herself and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta were lying in their initial response to FBI director James Comey's letter. Both Hillary Clinton and Podesta claimed in their initial response that the letter was only sent to Republicans on Capitol Hill, but after Wallace pressed Mook twice on the question the Clinton campaign manager admitted both his candidate and her campaign chair lied to the public. ""Chris, if your question is whether Democratic leaders were CC'ed on that letter, the answer is absolutely yes,"" Mook relented, admitting Hillary Clinton and Podesta lied when they claimed otherwise.Meanwhile, over on CNN, State of the Union anchor Jake Tapper corrected Podesta's inaccurate claim that Huma Abedin ""cooperated"" with federal law enforcement authorities. ""John, she hasn't been completely cooperative if she didn't turn over every device that had State Department emails on them and this one computer did,"" Tapper informed Podesta, who a moment earlier falsely claimed that Abedin ""cooperated"" with law enforcement on the investigation. Of course, the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's email scandal was reopened precisely because a device was found in former Rep. Anthony Weiner's possession during the federal grand jury investigation into Weiner's alleged lewd communications with underage girls. Weiner is Abedin's estranged husband, and now this development connects the Clinton Foundation, Clinton email and Huma Abedin-Anthony Weiner scandals altogether with a single thread. A former Assistant Director of the FBI confirmed on CNN over the weekend that federal law enforcement is conducting a wide-ranging criminal investigation into the Clinton Foundation. This means there are three separate but interrelated tracks on which federal authorities are investigating these matters. The web of investigations includes the reopened email case, the Foundation case, and the Weiner case. The first two directly implicate Hillary Clinton herself for sure, and the third one directly implicates a longtime Clinton ally in Weiner--and his estranged wife Huma Abedin, the longtime Hillary Clinton confidante. All of this comes as WikiLeaks continues to publish trove after trove of thousands upon thousands of pages of emails from Podesta that keep crushing the Clinton campaign in the final weeks.""I think this just shows there is a cumulative effect of this,"" Peter Schweizer, the author of Clinton Cash, the president of the Government Accountability Institute, and a Breitbart News senior editor-at-large said on Breitbart News Sunday. ""If you're investigating the Clinton Foundation, one of the things you're trying to do of course is find all communications that might be related to that investigation. So, I think as things proceed in looking at Anthony Weiner's case, and the question of the emails and whether Huma Abedin turned them all over to the FBI which she clearly did not, that also provides potential fodder for evidence for the Clinton Foundation investigation. What it seems like, based on the quantity of emails on the Anthony Weiner computer--which is an astronomical number when you think about it--clearly some of those are going to be related to what Huma Abedin was communicating with Hillary Clinton. So we'll just have to wait and see how powerful it is, but I think it is serious trouble for the Clintons on all fronts as it concerns criminal investigations now in three separate areas.""Schweizer added that he expects in these forthcoming emails--reported by the Wall Street Journal to number more than half a million, 650,000 approximately--""we're going to find evidence of what the Clinton Foundation was doing that's going to build on the Podesta emails.""LISTEN TO PETER SCHWEIZER ON BREITBART NEWS SUNDAYThe Trump campaign is confident that they're zoning in on a win on Nov. 8.""Well I think what's most interesting is we're seeing a lot of Hillary's top supporters either remain quiet or as I just saw on Twitter, reporting by Zeke Miller of Time, that Doug Schoen another top analyst at Fox News just said he's actively reassessing his support of Hillary,"" A.J. Delgado, another top Trump adviser, said in a joint appearance with Miller in studio on Breitbart News Sunday on Sunday evening. ""So not only are we seeing voters across the country--I think it was over a third--saying they think this could affect their vote, but actually some of her top supporters in national media are either remaining quiet because they don't want to defend her or they are actively reassessing like Doug Schoen just said. Pretty big.""Republican National Committee (RNC) co-chair Sharon Day, in an exclusive op-ed for Breitbart News over the weekend, called on top Democrats and media organizations who had previously endorsed Hillary Clinton to actively reconsider their endorsements. Schoen withdrew his endorsement of Clinton on Sunday night.Miller, Trump's senior communications adviser, pointed to a Daily Beast piece about how the Clintons were pushing to orchestrate ex-prosecutors and former Justice Department officials to speak out the FBI director James Comey as well.""It is so engrained in [the Clintons'] culture to try to manipulate government entities from behind the scenes, to try to manipulate the media and the news flow that at a certain point you have to wonder what's real, but I think this all goes to a point Mr. Trump continually makes about draining the swamp,"" Miller said. ""It's really become encapsulated in this one phrase, this one sentence, that 'we want change.' This is so much bigger than Donald Trump. This is so much bigger than Hillary Clinton. We want a change in direction. We want to completely drain the swamp, throw the bums out and get some real representation in Washington that isn't just there to get rich.""Miller noted that the Trump campaign is now actively contesting in deep blue states including New Mexico and Michigan--which haven't voted for a Republican for president in years--among others, aiming to swing them in his direction as Clinton's campaign implodes. The momentum for Trump in these states, Miller noted, was already shifting before the FBI director's announcement that criminal investigation into Clinton's email scandal is reopened.""Here's the exciting part for everybody listening: These things all started last week,"" Miller said.So, even before we had the news about the FBI, even before we had the news about Clinton, Inc., and the $66 million memo that they had to figure out how they're going to get rich, going all the way back to where things really started moving was at the beginning of last week. But then when the Obamacare news hit, with the premiums going up last week, that is when we saw a seismic shift and the reason being not just because this was something Mr. Trump was talking about but it was because every single newscast and every single paper int he country talked about what the percentages were impacting their state.Miller says that internal campaign polling in Michigan and New Mexico show the race in those states--any one of which, combined with states the campaign believes it already has locked down or close to locked down, would push Trump over the 270 electoral vote margin--is a ""dead heat."" Miller also noted the race tightening in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and predicted other states will now open up to the Trump message in the final week plus of the campaign.""Donald Trump changes the map,"" Miller said.And if you look at this race through the lens of '04 and '08 and '12, you're going to miss everything that's going on. You're going to look at the wrong issues, you're going to be looking at the wrong states and the wrong places. Donald Trump is putting blue states, what would have been viewed as blue states, in play in a way that no one has in years. Case in point: Wisconsin, where we're going to be on Tuesday, the Democrats--Hillary Clinton, specifically--just went up with a TV buy there on Friday after all this time that they're talking about going on offense in the red states. They're now up on TV in Wisconsin, which is supposed to be a safe blue state. They're up on TV because they see the numbers tightening. Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton are spending a lot of time in Pennsylvania, which is supposed to be a blue state, but Mr. Trump is putting them in play with his message on trade. Some of these areas, particularly the Midwest, has been devastated in their manufacturing sectors. Mr. Trump will go and reinvigorate these. There is an optimism and an energy with this campaign that I haven't seen in my entire life and none of us may ever see again. So we're in New Mexico today, tomorrow Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin on Tuesday--these are blue states where not only are we going on offense because we think we have a shot. We're going there because we think we can win.The news that came out on Friday with the FBI reopening their investigation is big. The fact that 11 days before this contest they found it so extraordinary that they need to go and put this out there I think really spoke to the fact that they found something. So what we found out then today is that there were upwards of 650,000 emails. Now, I'm sure you probably have a lot of emails on your laptop--I'm not sure how many--650,000 is a lot. But 650,000--that's a big number.

Clearly this entire email setup was done to get around the confines of having to go through the government so people couldn't get a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act request] and find out what was going on. As we saw, this all ties back in to the news that came out on Wednesday and Thursday about 'Clinton, Inc.,' and the $66 million pay-to-play scheme that Doug Band set up.So, even before we had the news about the FBI, even before we had the news about Clinton, Inc., and the $66 million memo that they had to figure out how they're going to get rich, going all the way back to where things really started moving was at the beginning of last week. But then when the Obamacare news hit, with the premiums going up last week, that is when we saw a seismic shift and the reason being not just because this was something Mr. Trump was talking about but it was because every single newscast and every single paper int he country talked about what the percentages were impacting their state.And if you look at this race through the lens of '04 and '08 and '12, you're going to miss everything that's going on. You're going to look at the wrong issues, you're going to be looking at the wrong states and the wrong places. Donald Trump is putting blue states, what would have been viewed as blue states, in play in a way that no one has in years. Case in point: Wisconsin, where we're going to be on Tuesday, the Democrats--Hillary Clinton, specifically--just went up with a TV buy there on Friday after all this time that they're talking about going on offense in the red states. They're now up on TV in Wisconsin, which is supposed to be a safe blue state. They're up on TV because they see the numbers tightening. Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton are spending a lot of time in Pennsylvania, which is supposed to be a blue state, but Mr. Trump is putting them in play with his message on trade. Some of these areas, particularly the Midwest, has been devastated in their manufacturing sectors. Mr. Trump will go and reinvigorate these. There is an optimism and an energy with this campaign that I haven't seen in my entire life and none of us may ever see again. So we're in New Mexico today, tomorrow Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin on Tuesday--these are blue states where not only are we going on offense because we think we have a shot. We're going there because we think we can win.SIGN UP"	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]

Arguably he was history's first feminist.""Sayyad writes that the prophet Muhammad would be ""appalled"" by how current Islamic radicals are treating women, which ""is certainly not consistent with anything we know about what Muhammad taught or how he treated women.""Yet Muhammad married a six-year-old girl named Aisha when he was in his fifties. According to the authoritative Sahih Bukhari, the consummation of their marriage occurred three years later. ""The Prophet wrote the marriage contract with her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old.""The Qur'an also permits Muslims to have sex with their female captives and slaves, a disposition regularly exploited by fighters of the Islamic State. The Qur'an praises those men who abstain from sex ""except from their wives or what their right hands possess (captives), for then they are not to be blamed.""Undaunted, Ms. Sayyad contends that Muhammad was ""fundamentally different"" from the founders of Buddhism, Judaism, Confucianism and Christianity, because he ""explicitly taught the radical equality of women and men"" and took ""numerous concrete measures"" to improve the status of women during his own lifetime.In point of fact, Muhammad taught that in the absence of a male witness, two women had to be brought to testify. The witness of a woman is equal to half of that of a man, he taught, ""because of the deficiency of her mind.""He also taught that women make up the majority of the damned in Hell because of their ""lack of common sense"" and their ""failings in religion.""Sayyad claims that Muhammad was ""sensitized to the plight of women"" because he was born poor, orphaned at a very early age, and illiterate. There is little historical evidence, however, that poor, orphaned, illiterate men tend to be especially respectful of women. In fact, in many cases the contrary would seem to hold true.To his credit, Muhammad did apparently abolish female infanticide in Arabia, which was undoubtedly a good thing. Nonetheless, this hardly establishes him as a champion of women's rights.Ms. Sayyad says that it ""is time for Islam to liberate women fully and do so upon the example of Muhammad and the authority of the Quran.""If that's the kind of liberation Muslim women are looking for, heaven help them.Follow Thomas D.
