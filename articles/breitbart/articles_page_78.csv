The overall trade deficit, including both goods and services, was lower at $500 billion. Trump has generally focused more on the deficit in goods, and the difficulty it represents for America's manufacturing sector.
by Frances Martel9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: MOSTLY TRUE""When I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it's a one-sided transaction where we're giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state - really, the number one terrorist state,"" Trump told the audience, responding to a question from the audience. ""We've made them a strong country from, really, a very weak country just three years ago.""Trump has made this claim regarding the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA), as the Iran nuclear deal is officially known, and received some criticism for it. Fact-checking websites such as Politifact have argued that Trump's claim is false because ""the money is already Iran's to begin with,"" but not denied that this amount of money would return to the control of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei thanks to the deal. The New York Times has argued that the $150 billion estimate is a fabrication by ""congressional Republicans"" far from the real amount of money Iran would once again control.As Algemeiner, citing Omri Ceren of the Israel Project, notes, the twelve-figure estimate of the money the deal would return to Iranian control came from President Barack Obama, not Republicans. President Obama said in an interview that Iran ""has $150 billion parked outside the country,"" arguing that not all of its funds under sanctions will be unfrozen immediately because ""unwinding the existing restraints... takes a certain amount of time.""This money does not include a separate $1.7 billion payment to the government of Iran, allegedly to atone for an arms sales agreement that never went through after the 1979 Islamic revolution. The U.S. government handed over that money the same day that Iran released several American citizens imprisoned on dubious charges.Both President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry, who played a major role in brokering the Iran nuclear deal, have admitted that the Iranian regime will likely use the money to fund terrorism, particularly activity by the Shiite terrorist organization Hezbollah.Bill Clinton was indeed impeached for lying under oath to a grand jury and obstructing justice, although he was not removed from office.After impeachment, Bill Clinton was held in contempt of court by federal Judge Susan Webber Wright, in what the New York Times described as a ""scathing"" ruling. Wright said Clinton testified falsely in his deposition about not having sex with Monica Lewinsky, and that his actions ""subverted the rule of law and violated Ms. Jones's right to information relevant to her case.""""The court takes no pleasure whatsoever in holding this nation's President in contempt of court,"" Wright wrote. However, she added, ""the record demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the President responded to plaintiffs' questions by giving false, misleading and evasive answers that were designed to obstruct the judicial process.""Clinton's law license in Arkansas was suspended for five years, and he paid a $25,000 fine. The Supreme Court also barred Clinton from practicing law before the nation's highest court.Trump made a reference to an $850,000 fine Bill Clinton paid to Paula Jones. This was, in fact, an out-of-court settlement Clinton reached with Jones, not a fine leveled by the court. The purpose of reaching an out-of-court settlement is to avoid an unpleasant trial that could very well end with even worse consequences, so Trump is basically correct that Clinton's conduct cost him $850,000, and he didn't want to pay it - it most certainly was not a charitable contribution! - but it technically wasn't a ""fine.""by Joel B. Pollak9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSE.Just two days ago, Trump apologized publicly for comments he made on a video recorded 2005 in which he joked about groping women. It is true that Trump tends to avoid apologizing, and that he did not apologize in some of the cases that Clinton mentioned. He did not apologize for the Birther controversy, for example -- though he has maintained that there is no need to do so, because he provoked President Barack Obama into finally producing his long-form birth certificate.Occasionally, Trump offers a sarcastic apology -- as he did when he ""apologized"" to Pocahontas for using her name to ridicule Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who allegedly faked Native American heritage to obtain a professorship at Harvard Law School. And in August, he expressed ""regret"" for some of the things he had said that had offended people (including, presumably, the Khizr Khan episode, which Clinton mentioned). He avoided saying the word ""apologize.""Still, the claim that Trump ""never"" apologizes is incorrect.by Katie McHugh9 Oct 2016""One of them is a wonderful woman, [who] at 12 years old was raped. At twelve. Her client -- she represented -- got him off, laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl that was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman, is here with us tonight. So, don't tell me about words,"" Trump said.  In the mid-1980s, journalist Roy Reed interviewed Hillary Clinton, and a tape of that interview has been uploaded to YouTube and is available in the Special Collections Department of the University of Arkansas libraries.  ""He took a lie detector test! I had him take a polygraph, which he passed, which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs,"" Clinton said about her client Thomas Alfred Taylor, who raped Shelton in 1975, laughing. Clinton also laughed in the video about saving the child rapist from a ""miscarriage of justice."" He served one year in county jail, with two months shaved off his sentence for the time he already served. Shelton's injuries were so traumatic, she could never have children. WATCH: Clinton also argued in court that the 12-year-old rape victim sought out older men. Shelton came forward after 40 years of silence, as reported by the Daily Mail: A child rape victim says she cannot forgive Hillary Clinton for defending her rapist in court 40 years ago, saying the Democratic presidential candidate attacked her credibility despite knowing that her assailant was guilty - and later laughed about it in a taped interview.Kathy Shelton was just 12 years old when a 41-year-old drifter raped her on the side of a desolate Arkansas road in 1975.Now, four decades later, she has agreed to be named and pictured for the first time in this Daily Mail Online exclusive because she is furious that her rapist's defense attorney - Hillary Clinton - has been portraying herself as a lifelong advocate of women and girls on the campaign trail.'It's put a lot of anger back in me,' said Shelton, now 54, in an exclusive interview at her Springdale, Arkansas, home in August. 'Every time I see [Clinton] on TV I just want to reach in there and grab her, but I can't do that.'In 1975, Clinton served as the defense lawyer for Thomas Alfred Taylor, a 41-year-old factory worker accused of raping Shelton after luring her to his car.Taylor pleaded down to 'unlawful fondling of a minor' and served less than a year in prison after Clinton was able to block the admission of forensic evidence that linked her client to the crime.Shelton also tweeted about her suffering at Hillary's hands.I don't care if Trump said gross things. I care that Hillary Clinton lied, terrorized, & mocked me, defending my rapist.-- Kathy Shelton (@KathyShelton_) October 9, 2016Hillary Clinton an advocate for women & children? Not even close.. She terrorized me during my rape case & later laughed about it. #facts-- Kathy Shelton (@KathyShelton_) October 9, 2016If I'd had justice vs my rapist, maybe I could have healed. But Hillary Clinton made sure I suffered loss of justice, then laughed it off.-- Kathy Shelton (@KathyShelton_) October 9, 2016Hillary Clinton is a cold-hearted liar. The lies she told about me, 12 yr old rape victim, traumatized me nearly as much as the rape itself.-- Kathy Shelton (@KathyShelton_) October 9, 2016No little girl should suffer violent rape like I did...But no grown woman should attack that little girl like @HillaryClinton did. #debate-- Kathy Shelton (@KathyShelton_) October 10, 2016At 12 I was one of the first women Hillary Clinton destroyed, but I wasn't the last. Please put an end to this woman's career of abusing us.-- Kathy Shelton (@KathyShelton_) October 10, 2016Fact-Check: FALSE.Capt. Khan was an Army officer who gave his life defending fellow soldiers in Iraq, and whose parents attacked Trump in a speech at the Democratic National Convention.When asked about the speech by ABC News' George Stephanopoulos (a former aide to President Bill Clinton), Trump made a comment about the silence of Khan's mother, who stood mute onstage alongside Khan's father.But Trump never said anything negative at all about Capt. Khan, and in fact praised his sacrifice on nearly every occasion. Trump reiterated his praise for the late Capt. Khan in his rebuttal to Clinton: ""Captain Khan is an American hero.""The recently-leaked transcripts of Hillary Clinton's paid speeches have her speaking supportively of single-payer systems, although in her public campaign pronouncements, she emphasizes ""fixing"" the problems with the Affordable Care Act. Some examples:""If you look at countries that are comparable, like Switzerland or Germany, for example, they have mixed systems. They don't have just a single-payer system, but they have very clear controls over budgeting and accountability. If you look at the single-payer systems, like Scandinavia, Canada, and elsewhere, they can get costs down because, you know, although their care, according to statistics, overall is as good or better on primary care, in particular, they do impose things like waiting times, you know. It takes longer to get like a hip replacement than it might take here."" (June 2013)""So we're in a learning period as we move forward with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. And I'm hoping that whatever the shortfalls or the glitches have been, which in a big piece of legislation you're going to have, those will be remedied and we can really take a hard look at what's succeeding, fix what isn't, and keep moving forward to get to affordable universal healthcare coverage like you have here in Canada."" (January 2015)What Clinton says in public is often very different than what she tells her private speaking audiences. For example, she recently said she thought single-payer would ""never, ever happen,"" but she was making a prediction and saying that ObamaCare repairs couldn't wait for a single-payer system to be created, not expressing her own policy preference: ""I want you to understand why I am fighting so hard for the Affordable Care Act. I don't want it repealed, I don't want us to be thrown back into a terrible, terrible national debate. I don't want us to end up in gridlock. People can't wait! People who have health emergencies can't wait for us to have a theoretical debate about some better idea that will never, ever come to pass.""During Clinton's primary run against Bernie Sanders, the New York Times found her moving to the left on health care and saying she was ""in favor of what's called the public option, so that people can buy into Medicare at a certain age."" Sanders was explicitly in favor of single-payer health care... and described it as ""Medicare for all.""by Jerome Hudson9 Oct 2016Fact-Check: FALSE. According to FBI Director James Comey, ""the FBI also discovered several thousand work-related e-mails that were not among the group of 30,000 e-mails returned by Secretary Clinton to State in 2014."" Federal investigators concluded that Clinton's lawyers deleted nearly half of the 60,000 emails on her server. Fact-Check: HALF TRUETrump was answering a question about Islamophobia, and while he acknowledged that prejudice against Muslims is a problem, he argued that political correctness places American lives at risk.  He cited the neighbors of the San Bernardino terrorists -- and he was correct to do so, because they did tell reporters after the attack that they had seen unusual activity, but chose not to report it for fear of being accused of racial profiling.However, the neighbors did not actually see ""bombs"" (though that was, in fact, what the San Bernardino terrorists were building in their home).So while Trump's statement about political correctness was essentially true, he was incorrect about the details.Clinton stated during the debate:""I will not let anyone into the country that I think will poses a risk to us, but there are a lot  refugees, women and children... There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely I believe because of Russian aggression, and we need to do our part. We are by no means carrying anywhere near the load Europe and others are. But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be, from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.""Fact-Check: FALSE (According to Clinton herself) The Wikileaks dump revealed that Clinton herself said refugees ""can't possibly"" be vetted, as Breitbart News reported: Breitbart News asked the Clinton campaign to reconcile the differences between Secretary Clinton's 2013 private remarks, where she said Syrian refugees ""can't possibly"" be vetted, to her 2015 and 2016 campaign claims that ""vigilant"" screening and ""vetting"" of ""refugees from Syria, guided by the best judgment of our security and diplomatic professionals,"" will be sufficient to safeguard American citizens from ""jihadists coming in along with legitimate refugees,"" but there has not yet been a response.We also asked the Clinton campaign to explain if Secretary Clinton believes the United States has unique vetting capabilities superior to those of Jordan, which enable us to successfully vet Syrian refugees; she admits we cannot.The entire quote from Clinton's speech to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago's Vanguard Luncheon on October 28, 2013, included in the WikiLeaks document dump of Hillary Clinton's paid speeches reads as follows:""So I think you're right to have gone to the places that you visited because there's a discussion going on now across the region to try to see where there might be common ground to deal with the threat posed by extremism and particularly with Syria which has everyone quite worried, Jordan because it's on their border and they have hundreds of thousands of refugees and they can't possibly vet all those refugees so they don't know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees,"" she said. ""Turkey for the same reason."" In September, a top Obama immigration official also admitted to Congress that some refugees launch terrorist plots after they've been ""vetted"" and invited into the United States. This is an extremely difficult statement to fact-check, because a great deal depends on what is meant by ""reforming the tax code."" A thorough rundown of Clinton's voting records on tax issues prepared by Forbes in April 2015 reveals little in Senator Clinton's record that could be fairly described as a significant reform.In summary, Clinton voted against the Bush tax cuts, but voted for a few amendments to the bill that did not pass; she eventually voted yes to extend those tax cuts, while complaining that she thought they benefited the wealthy too much. She voted in favor of a minor alteration to the Alternative Minimum Tax, to raise the exemption, while voting against a bill that would have repealed it, something that would have been a major tax reform. At the end of her term, she tried to raise the top marginal tax rate back to its pre-Bush level, which is hardly a ""reform"" of the system.Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSEWhile one video published by the Al Qaeda affiliate Al-Shabaab in Somalia uses video of Trump calling for a ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,"" Trump is largely absent from Al Qaeda, Islamic State, Hamas, and Hezbollah propaganda - the major jihadist groups who expend resources on producing propaganda to recruit fighters.Much of the propaganda released by one of the most active jihadist groups in the world, the Islamic State, focuses largely on the Quranic theme of jihad (""holy war"") and cites both the Quran and the Islamic documents known as hadiths. At one time, half of the propaganda the group published sold potential recruits on constructing a jihadist utopia in Syria and Iraq. Much of the media that does not touch on the benefits of living in a society cleansed of infidels instead depicts graphic executions, including some performed by children, intended to intimidate the Western world.One exception is a video in which an image of Bill Clinton captioned ""fornicator"" is used as a rallying cry to destroy America, ""a secular state built on man-made laws whose soldiers fight for the interests of legislators, liars, fornicators, corporations, and for the freedom of Sodomites.""The rise of groups like the Islamic State - formerly Al Qaeda in Iraq - has been fueled significantly by the growing chaos in the Middle East that followed the implementation of President Barack Obama's foreign policy since 2008. The Obama White House's approach to the Arab Spring, the Syrian Civil War, the fall of Muammar Qaddafi in Libya, the Houthi uprising in Yemen, and the teenaged war in Afghanistan have all left significant power vacuums from which jihadist groups have benefitted greatly - not just the Islamic State, but formerly moribund jihadist groups like Al Qaeda. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was critical in implementing these policies.Fact-Check: HALF FALSEIt is true that the Birther movement started among Hillary Clinton's supporters. And, as Breitbart News reported, Clinton's former campaign manager, Patti Solis Doyle, admitted that at least one member of the campaign had helped propagate the rumor (though she said that person was fired.) It is also likely true that Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal shopped the story to reporters. And it is unknown how much involvement Hillary Clinton herself had with the movement.However, it is a stretch to say, as Trump did, that Hillary Clinton herself personally started the Breitbart movement, and it is incorrect to claim that her campaign manager corroborated that particular accusation.(The real truth about the Birther rumor, which the mainstream media choose to ignore, may be that Barack Obama started it himself by allowing his literary agent to claim, for nearly two decades, that he was born in Kenya.)The New York Times obtained Trump's tax returns which revealed that the Republican nominee avoided paying federal income taxes by reporting losses on his 1995 tax return.Clinton criticized Trump as the hypocritical embodiment of ""the same rigged system he claims he will change.""However, Clinton herself has taken advantage of the same tax loopholes she's hammered Trump over. According to Clinton's 2015 tax returns, she reported capital gains losses to lessen her tax burden through a ""carryover.""On page 17, ""Capital Gains and Losses"" for ""William J Clinton & Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Clintons reported a ""long-term capital loss carryover"" of $699,540. In other words, Hillary Clinton reported a ""net long-term capital gain or (loss)"" of negative ""$699,540.""During Sunday's debate clinton also falsely stated that Trump is ""somebody who maybe hasn't paid federal income taxes in 20 years."" That statement is also false. The Times admits that Trump's tax statements reveal that he may have avoided paying income taxes for ""up to 18 years.""""They had a chance to do something with Syria, and that was the line,"" Republican nominee Donald Trump said of his Democratic rival and the administration in which she worked. ""You were there as Secretary of State with the so-called 'line in the sand.'""""No, I wasn't, I was gone,"" Clinton replied.Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSEPresident Obama delivered his famous ""red line"" speech - in which he described the use of chemical weapons against civilians by Assad as a ""red line"" that Assad could not cross without suffering serious international consequences - in August 2012.""We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus,"" President Obama said at the time.Hillary Clinton served President Obama as Secretary of State from January 21, 2009 to February 1, 2013, according to the State Department. She was not in office when Assad used chemical weapons yet again in 2015, violating international law. The White House did not respond to Assad with any direct military retaliation. Assad was most recently accused of using chemical weapons against civilians in Aleppo in September 2016. He remains dictator of Syria after ""winning"" an election in 2014.Clinton has frequently made this claim on the campaign trail, so media organizations have already had an opportunity to vet it. In June, the Washington Post gave her copious benefit of the doubt for being in favor of the concept behind the bill, but if she played any role in winning congressional approval, it was ""hidden"" and ""debatable.""""By all accounts, the prime mover behind CHIP was the late Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.). He was inspired by a similar Massachusetts program and then enlisted Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) as his partner in the effort. The idea was to fund children's health care with money raised from taxes on tobacco products. Bill Clinton endorsed the idea in his 1997 State of the Union address but then backed off when it appeared that the concept would imperil budget talks with Republicans. With urging from the president, a Senate vote in May doomed the plan,"" said the Washington Post fact-check.Efforts to fact-check Hillary Clinton's role in pushing the bill have produced conflicting accounts - which, in and of itself, refutes her claim of bold bipartisan leadership. If Clinton was the driving force behind getting Democrats and Republicans together on CHIP, rather than Kennedy and Hatch, there wouldn't be any real dispute about her role.Also, the accounts that do give her credit for helping with the bill are mostly words of appreciation from friendly Democrats, such as Kennedy's office. For example, a senior health adviser to Kennedy, Nick Littlefield, said of Clinton: ""She wasn't a legislator, she didn't write the law, and she wasn't the president, so she didn't make the decisions. But we relied on her, worked with her and she was pivotal in encouraging the White House to do it.""That encomium hardly supports Clinton's claim of playing a leading role in rallying congressional support; she was, at best, useful for encouraging her husband's White House to stick with the bill.Clinton has occasionally claimed to have played a role in creating the CHIP legislation, a claim no knowledgeable contemporaneous source seems willing to support. More damningly, a 2008 review by the Boston Globe - fact-checking Clinton's claims during her primary run against Barack Obama - found that Clinton ""had little to do with crafting the landmark legislation or ushering it through Congress, according to several lawmakers, staffers, and healthcare advocates involved in the issue.""Orrin Hatch himself said of Clinton, ""I do like her. We all care about children. But does she deserve credit for SCHIP? No - Teddy does, but she doesn't."" (""Teddy"" is a reference to Senator Ted Kennedy.)Fact-Check: FALSEClinton never apologized for the statement, despite what her running mate and other surrogates have claimed. Here is her full statement after her remarks emerged in the media. Note that the words ""sorry"" and ""apologize"" do not appear in any form, and that she merely says she ""regret[s]"" using the term ""half."" She doubled-down on the term ""deplorable."" Even the Huffington Post, openly hostile to Trump, said: ""Clinton Stands By 'Deplorables,' But Walks Back The Basket Size A Bit.""HuffPo noted that Clinton said: ""I regret saying 'half' -- that was wrong."" But she did not apologize, and the reason she responded immediately was that she had been caught.Trump made himself a victim of hyperbole with this statement. If he had said America was currently experiencing one of its slowest growth periods since 1929, he would have been entirely correct, but there have been a few slower periods - and, of course, a few outright recessions, or negative growth - since then.It would be playing word games to argue that the recessions shouldn't be counted, because they weren't economic growth. Even so, it wouldn't be correct to say the current growth rate is the absolute worst since 1929, although it is among the worst.It has been argued that the post-2009 recovery was the weakest of the post-war era, and that Obama's is the only presidency since the Great Depression that never reached 3% GDP growth, but that's not what Trump said.During a March 13, CNN Town Hall in Columbus, Ohio, Clinton said, ""We're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.""Clinton continued to explain that ""we've got to move away from coal and all the other fossil fuels, but I don't want to move away from the people who did the best they could to produce the energy that we relied on.""Ohio, a key battleground state, was the ninth largest coal producing state in 2013. Responding to an audience question asking what he would do to diminish ""Islamophobia,"" Trump noted that the United States has been targeted on multiple occasions in the past year by ""radical Islamic terrorists. ""And she,"" referring to Clinton, ""won't even mention the word and nor will President Obama.""""He won't use the term, 'radical Islamic terrorism,'"" he continued. ""Now, to solve the problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name. She won't say the name and President Obama won't say the name.""In their coverage of Sunday night's debate, website Politifact noted that ""Trump is right that Clinton and Obama prefer to avoid those words."" While Clinton has, during the course of her campaign for president this year, claimed that she was comfortable saying ""radical Islamism"" (though not ""radical Islamic terrorism"") she has previously refused to use the term because ""it sounds like we are declaring war against a religion.""President Obama has refused to describe jihadist attacks as radical Islamic terrorism because ""terrorist organizations like al Qaeda or ISIL -- They have perverted and distorted and tried to claim the mantle of Islam for an excuse for basically barbarism and death.""A recent Breitbart/Gravis poll found that the issue of addressing jihadist attacks as ""radical Islamic terrorism"" is of particular concerns of Americans of Hispanic descent. 67.7 percent of Hispanic American respondents - more than any other ethnic group, including White Americans - in the September 20 poll agreed with the phrase ""We must identify Islamic radical terrorism for what it is. You cannot defeat something if you cannot talk about it.""""'No, there wasn't 'check out a sex tape,' It was just, take a look at the person she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout,"" Trump replied.Trump tweeted after the first presidential debate that voters should look into former Miss Universe Alicia Machado's background and see she was not the angel the Clinton campaign painted her as: Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2016Trump tweeted, ""Check out sex tape and past,"" encouraging voters to look into Machado's background, not watch her have sex on tape as she did on a reality show (which the media claimed wasn't a ""sex tape""), as she cheated on her then-fiancee for the camera.Machado later had a child out of wedlock with one of Mexico's most dangerous drug lords. Trump said the following:We are going to be thriving again. We have no growth in this country. If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it's like a national catastrophe. We're down to 1 percent. And that's like no growth. We're going lower in my opinion. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high. Just about the highest in the world. And I'm bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. And I think it's so important, one of the most important things we can do. But she is raising everybody's taxes massively.""She,"" of course, refers to Hillary Clinton. Trump was speaking in the context of his own plan to lower taxes to spur economic growth, versus Clinton's plan to raise taxes.Trump said U.S. GDP growth is ""down to 1 percent."" In fact, GDP growth was originally reported as 1.1 percent for the second quarter of 2016, and later revised up to 1.4 percent. Trump's statement is very close to the original number, and only a bit of an overstatement for the revised number.As for Trump's assessment of the U.S. as having ""just about the highest"" taxes in the world, he did leave himself a bit of wiggle room by saying ""just about."" More importantly, to assess the truth of his statement, we must consider which taxes he's talking about. There are numerous countries with higher income tax rates - America is not even Top 10 on that score. But U.S. does have one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world - currently the third highest, behind the United Arab Emirates and Puerto Rico. Given Puerto Rico's unique status, it would be fair to say the United States has the second highest tax rate of any nation.America's top marginal corporate tax rate is 35%, while the world average is only 22.5%, and the European average is about 19%. Trump wants to dramatically reduce the U.S. rate to 15%.Given the context of his remarks, it seems fair to assume he was talking about corporate tax rates when he said America's were among the highest in the world, although he did not explicitly state that.Fact-Check: TRUE.According to the the Urban Institute, which examined the average Obamacare premium increases from 2015 to 2016, American consumers can expect to see major spikes in their healthcare costs.Those people in Oklahoma, who bought their own low-cost exchange insurance plan, have seen their premiums rise 41.8 percent from 2015 to 2016. The increase was 38.6 percent in Tennessee, 25.8 in Minnesota, and 24.8 percent in Colorado. Californians purchasing an Obamacare health exchange plan are looking at an average rate hike of 13.2 percent.USA Today, which has not been complementary to Trump, admits that ""many of next year's premium rate increases on the Affordable Care Act exchanges threaten to surpass the high and wildly fluctuating rates that characterized the individual insurance market before the health law took effect.""
A child rape victim says she cannot forgive Hillary Clinton for defending her rapist in court 40 years ago, saying the Democratic presidential candidate attacked her credibility despite knowing that her assailant was guilty - and later laughed about it in a taped interview.
Kathy Shelton was just 12 years old when a 41-year-old drifter raped her on the side of a desolate Arkansas road in 1975.
Now, four decades later, she has agreed to be named and pictured for the first time in this Daily Mail Online exclusive because she is furious that her rapist's defense attorney - Hillary Clinton - has been portraying herself as a lifelong advocate of women and girls on the campaign trail.
'It's put a lot of anger back in me,' said Shelton, now 54, in an exclusive interview at her Springdale, Arkansas, home in August. 'Every time I see [Clinton] on TV I just want to reach in there and grab her, but I can't do that.'
In 1975, Clinton served as the defense lawyer for Thomas Alfred Taylor, a 41-year-old factory worker accused of raping Shelton after luring her to his car.
Taylor pleaded down to 'unlawful fondling of a minor' and served less than a year in prison after Clinton was able to block the admission of forensic evidence that linked her client to the crime.

We also asked the Clinton campaign to explain if Secretary Clinton believes the United States has unique vetting capabilities superior to those of Jordan, which enable us to successfully vet Syrian refugees; she admits we cannot.
The entire quote from Clinton's speech to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago's Vanguard Luncheon on October 28, 2013, included in the WikiLeaks document dump of Hillary Clinton's paid speeches reads as follows:
""So I think you're right to have gone to the places that you visited because there's a discussion going on now across the region to try to see where there might be common ground to deal with the threat posed by extremism and particularly with Syria which has everyone quite worried, Jordan because it's on their border and they have hundreds of thousands of refugees and they can't possibly vet all those refugees so they don't know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees,"" she said.

BREITBART LIVEby John Haywardby9 Oct 2016During the second presidential debate, Republican nominee Donald Trump said that America's trade deficit in goods was nearly $800 billion last year.Fact-Check: TRUEThe actual trade deficit in goods for 2015 was $763 billion, so Trump's statement is essentially correct. The overall trade deficit, including both goods and services, was lower at $500 billion. Trump has generally focused more on the deficit in goods, and the difficulty it represents for America's manufacturing sector.trade deficitby Frances MartelDuring the opening statements on Sunday night's presidential debate, Republican nominee Donald Trump described the Iran nuclear deal as a ""one-sided transaction"" that would result in $150 billion returning to the coffers of the Islamic Republic of Iran.Fact-Check: MOSTLY TRUE""When I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it's a one-sided transaction where we're giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state - really, the number one terrorist state,"" Trump told the audience, responding to a question from the audience. ""We've made them a strong country from, really, a very weak country just three years ago.""Trump has made this claim regarding the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA), as the Iran nuclear deal is officially known, and received some criticism for it. Fact-checking websites such as Politifact have argued that Trump's claim is false because ""the money is already Iran's to begin with,"" but not denied that this amount of money would return to the control of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei thanks to the deal. The New York Times has argued that the $150 billion estimate is a fabrication by ""congressional Republicans"" far from the real amount of money Iran would once again control.the money is already Iran's to begin withcongressional RepublicansAs Algemeiner, citing Omri Ceren of the Israel Project, notes, the twelve-figure estimate of the money the deal would return to Iranian control came from President Barack Obama, not Republicans. President Obama said in an interview that Iran ""has $150 billion parked outside the country,"" arguing that not all of its funds under sanctions will be unfrozen immediately because ""unwinding the existing restraints... takes a certain amount of time.""Algemeinersaid in an interviewThis money does not include a separate $1.7 billion payment to the government of Iran, allegedly to atone for an arms sales agreement that never went through after the 1979 Islamic revolution. The U.S. government handed over that money the same day that Iran released several American citizens imprisoned on dubious charges.$1.7 billionhanded over that moneyBoth President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry, who played a major role in brokering the Iran nuclear deal, have admitted that the Iranian regime will likely use the money to fund terrorism, particularly activity by the Shiite terrorist organization Hezbollah.President ObamaSecretary of State John KerryDuring the second presidential debate, Republican nominee Donald Trump said that Bill Clinton was impeached, disbarred, and fined as a result of the Lewinsky scandal.Bill Clinton was indeed impeached for lying under oath to a grand jury and obstructing justice, although he was not removed from office.impeachedAfter impeachment, Bill Clinton was held in contempt of court by federal Judge Susan Webber Wright, in what the New York Times described as a ""scathing"" ruling. Wright said Clinton testified falsely in his deposition about not having sex with Monica Lewinsky, and that his actions ""subverted the rule of law and violated Ms. Jones's right to information relevant to her case.""New York Times""The court takes no pleasure whatsoever in holding this nation's President in contempt of court,"" Wright wrote. However, she added, ""the record demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the President responded to plaintiffs' questions by giving false, misleading and evasive answers that were designed to obstruct the judicial process.""Clinton's law license in Arkansas was suspended for five years, and he paid a $25,000 fine. The Supreme Court also barred Clinton from practicing law before the nation's highest court.suspendedTrump made a reference to an $850,000 fine Bill Clinton paid to Paula Jones. This was, in fact, an out-of-court settlement Clinton reached with Jones, not a fine leveled by the court. $850,000 fineThe purpose of reaching an out-of-court settlement is to avoid an unpleasant trial that could very well end with even worse consequences, so Trump is basically correct that Clinton's conduct cost him $850,000, and he didn't want to pay it - it most certainly was not a charitable contribution! - but it technically wasn't a ""fine.""by Joel B. PollakDemocratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton claimed that Donald Trump ""never apologizes for anything, to anyone.""Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSE.Just two days ago, Trump apologized publicly for comments he made on a video recorded 2005 in which he joked about groping women. apologized publiclyIt is true that Trump tends to avoid apologizing, and that he did not apologize in some of the cases that Clinton mentioned. He did not apologize for the Birther controversy, for example -- though he has maintained that there is no need to do so, because he provoked President Barack Obama into finally producing his long-form birth certificate.Occasionally, Trump offers a sarcastic apology -- as he did when he ""apologized"" to Pocahontas for using her name to ridicule Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who allegedly faked Native American heritage to obtain a professorship at Harvard Law School.apologized And in August, he expressed ""regret"" for some of the things he had said that had offended people (including, presumably, the Khizr Khan episode, which Clinton mentioned). He avoided saying the word ""apologize.""Still, the claim that Trump ""never"" apologizes is incorrect.by Katie McHughDuring the second presidential debate, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said, ""Hillary Clinton attacked them viciously,"" referring to former president Bill Clinton's female victims and a child rape victim whose attacker Clinton defended. ""One of them is a wonderful woman, [who] at 12 years old was raped. At twelve. Her client -- she represented -- got him off, laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl that was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman, is here with us tonight. So, don't tell me about words,"" Trump said.  In the mid-1980s, journalist Roy Reed interviewed Hillary Clinton, and a tape of that interview has been uploaded to YouTube and is available in the Special Collections Department of the University of Arkansas libraries.  ""He took a lie detector test! I had him take a polygraph, which he passed, which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs,"" Clinton said about her client Thomas Alfred Taylor, who raped Shelton in 1975, laughing. Clinton also laughed in the video about saving the child rapist from a ""miscarriage of justice."" He served one year in county jail, with two months shaved off his sentence for the time he already served. Shelton's injuries were so traumatic, she could never have children. WATCH: Clinton also argued in court that the 12-year-old rape victim sought out older men. Shelton came forward after 40 years of silence, as reported by the Daily Mail: A child rape victim says she cannot forgive Hillary Clinton for defending her rapist in court 40 years ago, saying the Democratic presidential candidate attacked her credibility despite knowing that her assailant was guilty - and later laughed about it in a taped interview.Kathy Shelton was just 12 years old when a 41-year-old drifter raped her on the side of a desolate Arkansas road in 1975.Now, four decades later, she has agreed to be named and pictured for the first time in this Daily Mail Online exclusive because she is furious that her rapist's defense attorney - Hillary Clinton - has been portraying herself as a lifelong advocate of women and girls on the campaign trail.'It's put a lot of anger back in me,' said Shelton, now 54, in an exclusive interview at her Springdale, Arkansas, home in August.

Humayun Khan ""has been subject to attack by [Republican nominee] Donald [Trump].""Fact-Check: FALSE.Capt. Khan was an Army officer who gave his life defending fellow soldiers in Iraq, and whose parents attacked Trump in a speech at the Democratic National Convention.When asked about the speech by ABC News' George Stephanopoulos (a former aide to President Bill Clinton), Trump made a comment about the silence of Khan's mother, who stood mute onstage alongside Khan's father.But Trump never said anything negative at all about Capt. Khan, and in fact praised his sacrifice on nearly every occasion. Trump reiterated his praise for the late Capt. Khan in his rebuttal to Clinton: ""Captain Khan is an American hero.""During the second presidential debate, Donald Trump accused Hillary Clinton of supporting single-payer health care.The recently-leaked transcripts of Hillary Clinton's paid speeches have her speaking supportively of single-payer systems, although in her public campaign pronouncements, she emphasizes ""fixing"" the problems with the Affordable Care Act. Some examples:examples""If you look at countries that are comparable, like Switzerland or Germany, for example, they have mixed systems. They don't have just a single-payer system, but they have very clear controls over budgeting and accountability. If you look at the single-payer systems, like Scandinavia, Canada, and elsewhere, they can get costs down because, you know, although their care, according to statistics, overall is as good or better on primary care, in particular, they do impose things like waiting times, you know.

(January 2015)What Clinton says in public is often very different than what she tells her private speaking audiences. For example, she recently said she thought single-payer would ""never, ever happen,"" but she was making a prediction and saying that ObamaCare repairs couldn't wait for a single-payer system to be created, not expressing her own policy preference: ""I want you to understand why I am fighting so hard for the Affordable Care Act. I don't want it repealed, I don't want us to be thrown back into a terrible, terrible national debate. I don't want us to end up in gridlock. People can't wait! People who have health emergencies can't wait for us to have a theoretical debate about some better idea that will never, ever come to pass.""During Clinton's primary run against Bernie Sanders, the New York Times found her moving to the left on health care and saying she was ""in favor of what's called the public option, so that people can buy into Medicare at a certain age."" Sanders was explicitly in favor of single-payer health care... and described it as ""Medicare for all.""by Jerome HudsonDuring the second presidential debate on Sunday evening, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said that she deleted ""personal emails, not official"" emails following her tenure as Secretary of State. Fact-Check: FALSE. According to FBI Director James Comey, ""the FBI also discovered several thousand work-related e-mails that were not among the group of 30,000 e-mails returned by Secretary Clinton to State in 2014."" Federal investigators concluded that Clinton's lawyers deleted nearly half of the 60,000 emails on her server. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump claimed that ""many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people [in San Bernardino].""Fact-Check: HALF TRUETrump was answering a question about Islamophobia, and while he acknowledged that prejudice against Muslims is a problem, he argued that political correctness places American lives at risk. He cited the neighbors of the San Bernardino terrorists -- and he was correct to do so, because they did tell reporters after the attack that they had seen unusual activity, but chose not to report it for fear of being accused of racial profiling.they did tell reportersHowever, the neighbors did not actually see ""bombs"" (though that was, in fact, what the San Bernardino terrorists were building in their home).So while Trump's statement about political correctness was essentially true, he was incorrect about the details.During the second presidential debate, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said that the massive influx of Muslim refugees she wants to import as president would be subjected to ""tough"" vetting and she would not let in any foreign-born refugee who would ""pose a risk"" to the U.S.Clinton stated during the debate:""I will not let anyone into the country that I think will poses a risk to us, but there are a lot  refugees, women and children... There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely I believe because of Russian aggression, and we need to do our part. We are by no means carrying anywhere near the load Europe and others are. But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be, from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.""Fact-Check: FALSE (According to Clinton herself) The Wikileaks dump revealed that Clinton herself said refugees ""can't possibly"" be vetted, as Breitbart News reported: Breitbart News asked the Clinton campaign to reconcile the differences between Secretary Clinton's 2013 private remarks, where she said Syrian refugees ""can't possibly"" be vetted, to her 2015 and 2016 campaign claims that ""vigilant"" screening and ""vetting"" of ""refugees from Syria, guided by the best judgment of our security and diplomatic professionals,"" will be sufficient to safeguard American citizens from ""jihadists coming in along with legitimate refugees,"" but there has not yet been a response.We also asked the Clinton campaign to explain if Secretary Clinton believes the United States has unique vetting capabilities superior to those of Jordan, which enable us to successfully vet Syrian refugees; she admits we cannot.The entire quote from Clinton's speech to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago's Vanguard Luncheon on October 28, 2013, included in the WikiLeaks document dump of Hillary Clinton's paid speeches reads as follows:""So I think you're right to have gone to the places that you visited because there's a discussion going on now across the region to try to see where there might be common ground to deal with the threat posed by extremism and particularly with Syria which has everyone quite worried, Jordan because it's on their border and they have hundreds of thousands of refugees and they can't possibly vet all those refugees so they don't know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees,"" she said. ""Turkey for the same reason."" In September, a top Obama immigration official also admitted to Congress that some refugees launch terrorist plots after they've been ""vetted"" and invited into the United States. During the second presidential debate, Donald Trump claimed that during her time as Senator, Hillary Clinton did nothing to reform the tax code.This is an extremely difficult statement to fact-check, because a great deal depends on what is meant by ""reforming the tax code."" A thorough rundown of Clinton's voting records on tax issues prepared by Forbes in April 2015 reveals little in Senator Clinton's record that could be fairly described as a significant reform.ForbesIn summary, Clinton voted against the Bush tax cuts, but voted for a few amendments to the bill that did not pass; she eventually voted yes to extend those tax cuts, while complaining that she thought they benefited the wealthy too much. She voted in favor of a minor alteration to the Alternative Minimum Tax, to raise the exemption, while voting against a bill that would have repealed it, something that would have been a major tax reform. At the end of her term, she tried to raise the top marginal tax rate back to its pre-Bush level, which is hardly a ""reform"" of the system.During the second 2016 presidential debate Sunday night, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton claimed that ""what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters.""Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSEWhile one video published by the Al Qaeda affiliate Al-Shabaab in Somalia uses video of Trump calling for a ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,"" Trump is largely absent from Al Qaeda, Islamic State, Hamas, and Hezbollah propaganda - the major jihadist groups who expend resources on producing propaganda to recruit fighters.one videoMuch of the propaganda released by one of the most active jihadist groups in the world, the Islamic State, focuses largely on the Quranic theme of jihad (""holy war"") and cites both the Quran and the Islamic documents known as hadiths. At one time, half of the propaganda the group published sold potential recruits on constructing a jihadist utopia in Syria and Iraq. Much of the media that does not touch on the benefits of living in a society cleansed of infidels instead depicts graphic executions, including some performed by children, intended to intimidate the Western world.halfgraphic executionsperformed by children,One exception is a video in which an image of Bill Clinton captioned ""fornicator"" is used as a rallying cry to destroy America, ""a secular state built on man-made laws whose soldiers fight for the interests of legislators, liars, fornicators, corporations, and for the freedom of Sodomites.""fornicatorThe rise of groups like the Islamic State - formerly Al Qaeda in Iraq - has been fueled significantly by the growing chaos in the Middle East that followed the implementation of President Barack Obama's foreign policy since 2008. The Obama White House's approach to the Arab Spring, the Syrian Civil War, the fall of Muammar Qaddafi in Libya, the Houthi uprising in Yemen, and the teenaged war in Afghanistan have all left significant power vacuums from which jihadist groups have benefitted greatly - not just the Islamic State, but formerly moribund jihadist groups like Al Qaeda. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was critical in implementing these policies.Obama White House's approachAl QaedacriticalRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump claimed that Hillary Clinton's campaign manager in 2008 admitted that the campaign had launched the Birther movement.Fact-Check: HALF FALSEIt is true that the Birther movement started among Hillary Clinton's supporters. And, as Breitbart News reported, Clinton's former campaign manager, Patti Solis Doyle, admitted that at least one member of the campaign had helped propagate the rumor (though she said that person was fired.) It is also likely true that Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal shopped the story to reporters. And it is unknown how much involvement Hillary Clinton herself had with the movement.admittedHowever, it is a stretch to say, as Trump did, that Hillary Clinton herself personally started the Breitbart movement, and it is incorrect to claim that her campaign manager corroborated that particular accusation.(The real truth about the Birther rumor, which the mainstream media choose to ignore, may be that Barack Obama started it himself by allowing his literary agent to claim, for nearly two decades, that he was born in Kenya.)Barack Obama started it himselfDuring the second presidential debate, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said Hillary Clinton ""complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code.""The New York Times obtained Trump's tax returns which revealed that the Republican nominee avoided paying federal income taxes by reporting losses on his 1995 tax return.Clinton criticized Trump as the hypocritical embodiment of ""the same rigged system he claims he will change.""However, Clinton herself has taken advantage of the same tax loopholes she's hammered Trump over. According to Clinton's 2015 tax returns, she reported capital gains losses to lessen her tax burden through a ""carryover.""2015 tax returnsOn page 17, ""Capital Gains and Losses"" for ""William J Clinton & Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Clintons reported a ""long-term capital loss carryover"" of $699,540. In other words, Hillary Clinton reported a ""net long-term capital gain or (loss)"" of negative ""$699,540.""During Sunday's debate clinton also falsely stated that Trump is ""somebody who maybe hasn't paid federal income taxes in 20 years."" That statement is also false. The Times admits that Trump's tax statements reveal that he may have avoided paying income taxes for ""up to 18 years.""avoided paying income taxes for ""up to 18 years.During Sunday night's presidential debate, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton denied that she was in office as Secretary of State when President Barack Obama refused to punish Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad for using chemical weapons against civilians after calling chemical weapons use a ""red line"" which could not be crossed.""They had a chance to do something with Syria, and that was the line,"" Republican nominee Donald Trump said of his Democratic rival and the administration in which she worked. ""You were there as Secretary of State with the so-called 'line in the sand.'""""No, I wasn't, I was gone,"" Clinton replied.President Obama delivered his famous ""red line"" speech - in which he described the use of chemical weapons against civilians by Assad as a ""red line"" that Assad could not cross without suffering serious international consequences - in August 2012.in August 2012""We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus,"" President Obama said at the time.Hillary Clinton served President Obama as Secretary of State from January 21, 2009 to February 1, 2013, according to the State Department. She was not in office when Assad used chemical weapons yet again in 2015, violating international law. The White House did not respond to Assad with any direct military retaliation. according to the State Departmentused chemical weapons yet again in 2015Assad was most recently accused of using chemical weapons against civilians in Aleppo in September 2016. He remains dictator of Syria after ""winning"" an election in 2014.September 2016winningDuring the second presidential debate, Hillary Clinton claimed to have had a leadership role in rallying bipartisan support for the Children's Health Insurance Program with bipartisan, which was signed into law in 1998 by her husband, President Bill ClintonClinton has frequently made this claim on the campaign trail, so media organizations have already had an opportunity to vet it. In June, the Washington Post gave her copious benefit of the doubt for being in favor of the concept behind the bill, but if she played any role in winning congressional approval, it was ""hidden"" and ""debatable.""Washington Post""By all accounts, the prime mover behind CHIP was the late Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.). He was inspired by a similar Massachusetts program and then enlisted Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) as his partner in the effort. The idea was to fund children's health care with money raised from taxes on tobacco products. Bill Clinton endorsed the idea in his 1997 State of the Union address but then backed off when it appeared that the concept would imperil budget talks with Republicans. With urging from the president, a Senate vote in May doomed the plan,"" said the Washington Post fact-check.Efforts to fact-check Hillary Clinton's role in pushing the bill have produced conflicting accounts - which, in and of itself, refutes her claim of bold bipartisan leadership. If Clinton was the driving force behind getting Democrats and Republicans together on CHIP, rather than Kennedy and Hatch, there wouldn't be any real dispute about her role.Also, the accounts that do give her credit for helping with the bill are mostly words of appreciation from friendly Democrats, such as Kennedy's office. For example, a senior health adviser to Kennedy, Nick Littlefield, said of Clinton: ""She wasn't a legislator, she didn't write the law, and she wasn't the president, so she didn't make the decisions. But we relied on her, worked with her and she was pivotal in encouraging the White House to do it.""That encomium hardly supports Clinton's claim of playing a leading role in rallying congressional support; she was, at best, useful for encouraging her husband's White House to stick with the bill.Clinton has occasionally claimed to have played a role in creating the CHIP legislation, a claim no knowledgeable contemporaneous source seems willing to support. More damningly, a 2008 review by the Boston Globe - fact-checking Clinton's claims during her primary run against Barack Obama - found that Clinton ""had little to do with crafting the landmark legislation or ushering it through Congress, according to several lawmakers, staffers, and healthcare advocates involved in the issue.""Boston GlobeOrrin Hatch himself said of Clinton, ""I do like her. We all care about children. But does she deserve credit for SCHIP? No - Teddy does, but she doesn't."" (""Teddy"" is a reference to Senator Ted Kennedy.)Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton claimed that she apologized for calling half of Donald Trump's supporters a ""basket of deplorables,"" saying ""within hours, I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that.""Fact-Check: FALSEClinton never apologized for the statement, despite what her running mate and other surrogates have claimed. Here is her full statement after her remarks emerged in the media. Note that the words ""sorry"" and ""apologize"" do not appear in any form, and that she merely says she ""regret[s]"" using the term ""half."" She doubled-down on the term ""deplorable."" full statementEven the Huffington Post, openly hostile to Trump, said: ""Clinton Stands By 'Deplorables,' But Walks Back The Basket Size A Bit.""saidHuffPo noted that Clinton said: ""I regret saying 'half' -- that was wrong."" But she did not apologize, and the reason she responded immediately was that she had been caught.During the second presidential debate, Donald Trump said America is currently experiencing the ""slowest economic growth since 1929.""Trump made himself a victim of hyperbole with this statement. If he had said America was currently experiencing one of its slowest growth periods since 1929, he would have been entirely correct, but there have been a few slower periods - and, of course, a few outright recessions, or negative growth - since then.It would be playing word games to argue that the recessions shouldn't be counted, because they weren't economic growth. Even so, it wouldn't be correct to say the current growth rate is the absolute worst since 1929, although it is among the worst.among the worstIt has been argued that the post-2009 recovery was the weakest of the post-war era, and that Obama's is the only presidency since the Great Depression that never reached 3% GDP growth, but that's not what Trump said.arguednever reached 3% GDP growthAt the second presidential debate, while discussing the topic of energy, fossils fuels, and jobs, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said Hillary Clinton ""wants to put all the miners out of business.""During a March 13, CNN Town Hall in Columbus, Ohio, Clinton said, ""We're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.""CNN Town Hallsaid,Clinton continued to explain that ""we've got to move away from coal and all the other fossil fuels, but I don't want to move away from the people who did the best they could to produce the energy that we relied on.""continued to explainOhio, a key battleground state, was the ninth largest coal producing state in 2013. ninth largest coal producing stateDuring Sunday night's presidential debate, the second of three such meetings, Republican nominee Donald Trump condemned his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama for refusing to use the phrase ""radical Islamic terrorism"" when discussing jihadist mass murders.Responding to an audience question asking what he would do to diminish ""Islamophobia,"" Trump noted that the United States has been targeted on multiple occasions in the past year by ""radical Islamic terrorists. ""And she,"" referring to Clinton, ""won't even mention the word and nor will President Obama.""""He won't use the term, 'radical Islamic terrorism,'"" he continued. ""Now, to solve the problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name. She won't say the name and President Obama won't say the name.""In their coverage of Sunday night's debate, website Politifact noted that ""Trump is right that Clinton and Obama prefer to avoid those words."" While Clinton has, during the course of her campaign for president this year, claimed that she was comfortable saying ""radical Islamism"" (though not ""radical Islamic terrorism"") she has previously refused to use the term because ""it sounds like we are declaring war against a religion.""radical Islamismit sounds like we are declaring war against a religionPresident Obama has refused to describe jihadist attacks as radical Islamic terrorism because ""terrorist organizations like al Qaeda or ISIL -- They have perverted and distorted and tried to claim the mantle of Islam for an excuse for basically barbarism and death.""becauseA recent Breitbart/Gravis poll found that the issue of addressing jihadist attacks as ""radical Islamic terrorism"" is of particular concerns of Americans of Hispanic descent. 67.7 percent of Hispanic American respondents - more than any other ethnic group, including White Americans - in the September 20 poll agreed with the phrase ""We must identify Islamic radical terrorism for what it is. You cannot defeat something if you cannot talk about it.""During the second presidential debate, moderator Anderson Cooper asked Republican nominee Donald Trump: ""In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 AM to 5 AM including one that told people to check out a sex tape. Is that the discipline of a good leader?""""'No, there wasn't 'check out a sex tape,' It was just, take a look at the person she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout,"" Trump replied.Trump tweeted after the first presidential debate that voters should look into former Miss Universe Alicia Machado's background and see she was not the angel the Clinton campaign painted her as: Machado later had a child out of wedlock with one of Mexico's most dangerous drug lords. During the second presidential debate, Donald Trump said the United States has among the highest taxes in the world, and it's hindering our economic growth.Trump said the following:We are going to be thriving again. We have no growth in this country. If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it's like a national catastrophe. We're down to 1 percent. And that's like no growth. We're going lower in my opinion. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high. Just about the highest in the world. And I'm bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. And I think it's so important, one of the most important things we can do. But she is raising everybody's taxes massively.""She,"" of course, refers to Hillary Clinton. Trump was speaking in the context of his own plan to lower taxes to spur economic growth, versus Clinton's plan to raise taxes.Trump said U.S. GDP growth is ""down to 1 percent."" In fact, GDP growth was originally reported as 1.1 percent for the second quarter of 2016, and later revised up to 1.4 percent. Trump's statement is very close to the original number, and only a bit of an overstatement for the revised number.GDP growthAs for Trump's assessment of the U.S. as having ""just about the highest"" taxes in the world, he did leave himself a bit of wiggle room by saying ""just about."" More importantly, to assess the truth of his statement, we must consider which taxes he's talking about. There are numerous countries with higher income tax rates - America is not even Top 10 on that score. But U.S. does have one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world - currently the third highest, behind the United Arab Emirates and Puerto Rico. Given Puerto Rico's unique status, it would be fair to say the United States has the second highest tax rate of any nation.Top 10third highestAmerica's top marginal corporate tax rate is 35%, while the world average is only 22.5%, and the European average is about 19%. Trump wants to dramatically reduce the U.S. rate to 15%.dramatically reduceGiven the context of his remarks, it seems fair to assume he was talking about corporate tax rates when he said America's were among the highest in the world, although he did not explicitly state that.During the second presidential debate, Donald Trump said because of Obamacare, ""health insurance and health care is going up.""Fact-Check: TRUE.According to the the Urban Institute, which examined the average Obamacare premium increases from 2015 to 2016, American consumers can expect to see major spikes in their healthcare costs.the Urban InstituteThose people in Oklahoma, who bought their own low-cost exchange insurance plan, have seen their premiums rise 41.8 percent from 2015 to 2016. The increase was 38.6 percent in Tennessee, 25.8 in Minnesota, and 24.8 percent in Colorado. 41.8 percentCalifornians purchasing an Obamacare health exchange plan are looking at an average rate hike of 13.2 percent.13.2 percentUSA Today, which has not been complementary to Trump, admits that ""many of next year's premium rate increases on the Affordable Care Act exchanges threaten to surpass the high and wildly fluctuating rates that characterized the individual insurance market before the health law took effect.""admits"

We have had her tee up stories for us before and have never been disappointed. While we should have a larger conversation in the near future about a broader strategy for reengageing [sic] the beat press that covers HRC, for this we think our objective and do the most shaping by going to Maggie.The Intercept reports that the memo discussed how to generate positive press for Clinton's decision making. The site found two articles by Haberman that did the job: here and here.In the first article, Haberman describes touts Clinton's decision to hire a research team to unearth negative items about her -- a process called ""self-vetting."" Her insider account bore the title ""Hillary Clinton Begins Process of Vetting -- Herself"":The scope of the firm's work is unclear. But self-research is considered critical in campaigns. And in the six years since Mrs. Clinton was last a candidate, she has created a paper trail of paid speeches, charitable donations and diplomatic decisions as secretary of state.For months, Democrats not aligned with Mrs. Clinton had privately wondered whether she had started the process of assessing the scope of existing documents, information and other potential material her rivals could use against her. Some expressed concern that she was beginning this self-scrubbing process relatively late, and might not leave herself enough time to learn about her own potential vulnerabilities to be able to respond effectively.In the second article, ""Hillary Clinton Aides Are in Talks to Fill Top Campaign Roles,"" Haberman shows the care and concern Clinton had building her team:The prospects are mostly people who have worked with Mrs. Clinton before, according to a person familiar with the discussions, who asked for anonymity to speak freely about personnel discussions.The conversations reflect a fast-moving effort by Mrs. Clinton to build a campaign as a number of Democratic Party operatives are vying for position. While the budding campaign had been criticized as too white and too male in its early stages, this group of operatives is diverse and would give Mrs. Clinton a number of women and people of color in top jobs.Greenwald and Fang wrote that they gave both the Clinton campaign and Haberman 24 hours to contest the veracity of the documents.

Barack Obama (D-IL) and the national headquarters of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, also known as ACORN--despite having enough evidence to do so.Raddatz, along with CNN's Anderson Cooper, will co-moderate this upcoming Sunday evening's presidential debate between GOP presidential nominee Donald J. Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton.After she and her producer received a tip about ACORN corruption--and Obama's connection to it--and evidence backing up the eventual whistleblower's claims, they showed initial interest in pursuing the story. Anita Moncrief, the eventual ACORN whistleblower told Breitbart News exclusively that she met with Raddatz's producer Avni Patel in 2008.Both Patel and Raddatz were given documents that they covered up and refused to report on until after the election. Raddatz, who was then the White House correspondent for ABC News, and her producer Patel were also provided with personal accounts of the collusion between ACORN and the Obama campaign in October 2008, Moncrief told Breitbart News.Moncrief, who worked in ACORN's Washington, D.C., headquarters, would later expose the organization when she turned into a full-blown whistleblower after the election. But if Raddatz ran the story, the election may have turned out differently, especially had the public known the depths to which this scandal went.Moncrief told Breitbart News that she met with Raddatz's producer Patel in Washington after initially having made contact with Raddatz herself through a representative. The meeting lasted almost an hour in a coffee shop in Washington, D.C.After meeting with Patel, Moncrief received an email from the producer:Anita,
It was good talking to you today. I look forward to learning more, and taking a look at those documents you mentioned. It sounds like the easiest way to get those from you would be to directly download the files from your web-transfer site. If that doesn't work, you can try to send them to my gmail account.Patel gave Moncrief every indication that ABC News was going to broadcast the report, she said.""They were very excited. They said they were willing to run the story,"" she said.Using the user name and password given to her by Patel, Moncrief sent documents on Oct. 14, 2008 to Patel using the company's file transfer protocol line, ftp1.abc.com. There was another transfer of another dozen documents by email to Patel on Oct. 26, 2008.Moncrief told Breitbart News that ABC News received and acknowledged receipt of the documents that spelled out specific instances of collusion between the Obama campaign and named individuals at ACORN and Project Vote. Among the documents were internal correspondences with Moncrief's name, which she said she included to prove that she was who she said she was.Moncrief told Breitbart News the Obama campaign passed to ACORN and by extension to its sister entity Project Vote the campaign's full donor list, which included all donors and fuller descriptions. This list was different from the limited list of contributors the campaign filed with the Federal Election Commission, which for example did not include small-dollar donors. Because of their non-profit status, ACORN and Project Vote were prohibited from coordinating with a candidate's committee.ACORN and Project Vote also received the full donor lists from the 2004 presidential campaign of then Sen. John F. Kerry (D-MA), she said.Soon after Moncrief left ACORN, she contacted the New York Times and its reporter Stephanie Strom about the cooperation she witnessed. Strom and Moncrief worked together from July 2008 to October 2008.But, by September, Moncrief said she was frustrated with Strom's articles that were based on her information about ACORN and Project Vote, but failed to describe the cooperation. Moncrief said Strom told her that her editors were watering down the stories after they were submitted.Attorney and columnist Michael Gaynor told Breitbart News that over the summer of 2008, he became an adviser to Moncrief and her effort to expose ACORN-Obama corruption.In September 2008, Moncrief told him that she was beginning to think that the Times was just stringing her along, he said. ""'I need a Plan B' she told me.""Gaynor calls himself a conservative Catholic and he said he immediately suggested EWTV, radio host Laura Ingraham and Fox News.The problem was that Moncrief was a left-wing activist and she wanted to go through a left-leaning media outlet, so he suggested ABC News and Martha Raddatz, he said.Gaynor said he met Raddatz through email because he she sent him proof that he had repeated a false claim about her suppressing the number of soldiers in Iraq supporting Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) for president.With that awkwardness between them, Gaynor said he reached out to Raddatz and explained to her the whole story of collusion between ACORN and Project Vote and the Obama campaign. After the initial conversation, Raddatz told Gaynor that she was interested. Moncrief said she then emailed Raddatz and attached her resume, so that Raddatz would appreciate her background. Raddatz emailed back and told her that Patel would would follow up.Raddatz has a troubled history of undisclosed associations with Democrats that arguably affect her ability to be impartial.She was the moderator for the 2012 vice presidential debate between Vice President Joe Biden and now House Speaker--then GOP vice presidential nominee--Paul Ryan. But Raddatz did not disclose to viewers that Biden's running mate, President Barack Obama, attended her 1991 wedding--when she married now former Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman Julius Genachowski.The position of FCC chairman is a presidentially-appointed slot, which means Obama, after attending her wedding to Genachowski, appointed her by-then ex-husband to one of the most senior positions in the federal government. Raddatz and Genachowski divorced in 1997. Genachowski, a long-time friend of the president's, also attended Obama's 1992 wedding, when he married First Lady Michelle Obama.At a public event in 2013, after Obama and Biden won reelection, Breitbart News confronted Raddatz about her failure to disclose the significant conflict of interest to the general public before moderating that debate.At the National Press Club event, Breitbart News' Matthew Boyle asked Raddatz:""Do you think--there was obviously a little bit of a kerfuffle ahead of the vice presidential debate about the fact that the president attended your wedding to the FCC chairman. Do you think that that was handled right and given a second chance would you have done it a little differently?""Raddatz responded:""I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't have to handle that. It was--and I'm really not going to comment about that. That was something that happened two days before the debate. It had been in The New York Times quite a while before that, I believe. I just got to put this out of my head. That had nothing to do with what I did at the debate. Nothing.""This revelation about ABC News covering up the ACORN story before the 2008 election is also not the first time that network--which is influenced heavily by former Bill Clinton White House staffer and ABC This Week anchor George Stephanopoulos--covered up a damning story about a Democrat right before an election.In fact, right before the 2012 election, ABC News among other outlets had been provided with intricate details about the scandal that has since, years later, led to the indictment of U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ). They had a chance to break part of the scandal, and chose to not print allegations from prostitutes in the Dominican Republic that Menendez had underpaid them for sex.They also had evidence of other parts of the Menendez scandal, particularly connections to Democratic Party mega-donor Dr. Salomon Melgen--who's also been indicted on the corruption charges--that the network decided against running.When Raddatz had Menendez on her program after the election with the scandal dominating national news, she conveniently forgot to ask him about it, as Breitbart News reported at the time.Shortly thereafter, ABC News attempted to undermine the accounts of several of the prostitutes--but after Menendez was indicted, the U.S. Department of Justice confirmed the prostitution allegations against Menendez were in fact supported by ""corroborating evidence.""Even BuzzFeed News admitted Breitbart News' Matthew Boyle--who originally reported the prostitution story while at The Daily Caller--was correct on the story.Anita,

An affidavit for a search warrant obtained by Breitbart Texas stated, ""It is currently the single largest purveyor of Internet sex ads in the United States, and Backpage.com's profits from this line of business register in the millions yearly.""The Texas and California attorneys general worked together on a lengthy investigation and found evidence that adult and child sex trafficking victims were forced into prostitution.Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton called the website a ""deep-seated evil"" and ""modern-day slavery."" He explained that the victims that are sex trafficked include both voluntary and involuntary participants and minors.The probable cause stated within the affidavit for a search warrant stated included that Backpage.com receives more than 90% of their revenues from adult escort ads. Just in California, those revenues for January 2013 to May 31, 2015 was $50 million, or between $1.5 to $2.5 million per month. It stated that Ferrer has been the CEO of the website since 2012 but has handled the day-to-day operations for the company for a much longer period. All business and financial records of shareholders Ferrer, Jim Larkin and Michael Lacey were targeted in the affidavit for search warrant.It also said that ""Ferrer's communications and emails obtained by search warrant, his interactions with law enforcement, and even the public statements of his high level executives, such as his General Counsel, reflect personal knowledge that Backpage.com derives support or maintenance from the earnings of people engaged in prostitution.""California's Pimping statute provides that it is a criminal offense ""knowing another person is a prostitute,"" to ""live, derive support or maintenance from the earnings or proceeds of a person's prostitution,"" or to ""solicit or receive compensation for soliciting for the person."" Ferrer faces a sentence from between three to eight years of imprisonment under the California felony pimping statute.In Texas, Ferrer also faces money laundering charges. Pimping qualifies as a ""criminal activity"" under the Texas Penal Code section for money laundering because it is an offense ""punishable by confinement for more than one year under the laws of another state."" The credit cards, gift cards, debit cards, Bitcoin, and cash used to purchase ads for prostitution on Backpage.com all qualify as ""funds"" under the Texas Penal Code. Under the Texas Money Laundering statute, the court can consider all $50 million generated by the websites's adult escort section in California when classifying this offense because it constitutes an ongoing business model and a continuing course of conduct, says the affidavit. ""If proceeds of criminal activity are related to one scheme or continuing course of conduct, whether from the same or several sources, the conduct may be considered as one offense and the value of the proceeds aggregated in determining the classification of the offense.""An offense in Texas for money laundering is a felony of the first degree if the value of the funds is $300,000 or more. Conviction would be punishable in prison time from five to 99 years up to life, and a fine of up to $10,000.Lana Shadwick is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

Do we have a shortage of dairy workers in western Wisconsin? Yes, we do. But in his own part of Wisconsin, at least 40 farms have solved the labor problem by hiring robots to milk their cows.Back in 2013, Ryan was also complaining about the a lack of dairy workers in Wisconsin.  As Ryan told the National Journal in 2013:""[Low-skilled immigrants] bring labor to our economy so jobs can get done. The dairy farmers in western Wisconsin are having a hard time finding anyone to help them produce their products, which are mostly cheese. If they can't find workers, then they can't produce, and we'll end up importing.Ryan even converted his 2013 argument about a labor shortage into an argument for cheap labor forever instead of labor-saving, productivity boosting machinery.The flip side of the argument is: Just raise wages enough to attract people. But you raise wages too much in certain industries, then you'll get rid of those industries, and we'll just have to import.""Dairy-milking machines are used at up to 70 percent of farms in some parts of Europe -- but are only used in a few percent of U.S. farms, said Justin Segner, a Wisconsin-based salesman for a European robot-maker, Lely. ""This is in its infancy in the United States,"" he said, partly because the federal government imposes stringent food-safety regulations on the cow-milking machines, and also because federal policy favors the use of migrant laborers, he said.Segner told Breitbart News that he's a ""huge fan"" of Paul Ryan, adding he plans to invite Ryan to see the cow-milking machines in operation.Lely's cow-milking machines are assembled by American workers in Pella, Iowa.Ryan's suggestion that there is a shortage of high-skilled tech workers is a favorite talking point amongst business interests and Silicon Valley executives, who stand to profit from an influx of wage-cutting foreign workers. However, it is a talking point that tech labor market experts have thoroughly debunked. U.S. Census data shows there are more than 11 million Americans with degrees with Science, Technology  Engineering and Math (STEM) who lack e employment in these fields. In fact, U.S. schools are graduating two times more students with STEM degrees than are annually finding employment in their professions.That sympathy for employers' demand for cheap labor is part of Ryan's long-standing libertarian worldview. For decades, he's and other GOP leaders have believed that companies should be able to hire foreign workers when they're not pleased with supply of American workers. This ""any willing worker"" view would condemn Americans and their grandchildren to an economy where salaries can't rise above the poverty wages that are acceptable to the next African or Asian willing to fly into the country.Ryan also justifies his support for migration by saying migrants are needed to fund retirement for a growing number of retired Americans:Boomers are retiring, we're going to need medical professions. We're going to need nurses and doctors ... even if we get everybody off of welfare into work ... we're still going to have population needs because of demographics in this country. [We're facing] a 90 percent increase in the retirement population but only a 19 percent increase in the [working] population. So we are going to need people, we are going to need legal immigrants. That means in my mind, visas ought to be given based upon your contribution to society, your skill set that is needed in our economy that cannot, is not being filled by Americans.Ryan's focus on migrants is misguided, says Steve Camarota, the research director at the Center for Immigration Studies. Even the current flood of immigrants is making make very little difference to the number of workers, and the migrants nudge up the birth rate by only about 4 percent, he said. Moreover, immigrants get older, they retire and they consume a huge amount of taxpayers funds that could otherwise preserve Americans' retirement programs, he said.""The thing about immigrants is that they tend to be much poorer than natives ... you can't pay for the retirement programs with a lot of immigrants who consume a lot of entitlement programs, such as welfare,"" he said.Moreover, there's no shortage of working-age Americans, Camarota said. ""America's problem is that we don't have enough people of working age -- our problem is that so many people of working age don't work.""The better fix, he said, is to increase the productivity of working Americans via better education, business practices and technology. ""Productivity is obviously the ultimate solution"" to the retirement problem, he said. In fact, Segner told Breitbart News that older farmers in Wisconsin are postponing their retirement because their robots are taking over the never-ending task of milking the cows, two or three times a day, 365 days a year.The fixation on cheap imported labor that is shared by Ryan and the business-backed wing of the GOP explains why Donald Trump won the 2016 nominee.Trump got the nomination because because he says the immigration system should be tuned to help Americans before it help business executives, Wall Street stockholders, or foreigners. That's the fundamental difference why Ryan's allies -- Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Gov. Jeb Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio -- were cheerfully kicked to the curb during the 2016 GOP primary by Trump's supporters.In a recent Arizona speech, Trump promised to enact ""new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first,"" and to keep ""immigration levels, measured by population share, within historical norms."" In the vice-presidential debate, Gov. Mike Pence said the immigration issue ""really does begin with us reforming our immigration system and putting the interests, particularly the safety and security of the American people, first.""Ryan is gradually learning from Trump's success. In his interview with Ryan, Brownstein insisted that polls show that most GOP supporters support amnesty, and then suggested Ryan should push GOP legislators to award ""legal status"" to the 11 million-plus cheap-labor illegal immigrants in the United States.But Ryan actually waived away Brownstein's immigrants-before-Americans agenda. ""You've got to start with security,"" Ryan replied.The problem so many people have is there's no faith or confidence we'll actually secure our borders, that will actually have interior security, so the feeling is that we will do something on the legal side [to help business] but we won't secure our border and that we'll have the same problem 10 years down the road.Brownstein pressed for a ""package"" mass-amnesty bill that is favored by his advertisers, by business groups and by Democrats, but Ryan didn't budge. What I don't think works is a big comprehensive bill. Those always collapse under their own weight. i think it's the wrong way to go. I think you stage reforms and  they must begin with a confidence-building exercise that is critical for national security...  -- [s0] secure the border, [do] interior reinforcement...In the day and age of heroin coming into our high schools and ISIS trying to penetrate southern border, you have got to deal with this ... if we deal with that in a way that gives people the sense that we are actually securing our country, then I think attitudes will change across the country where people then are willing to embrace fixing our broken immigration system.That new emphasis on proven border security before eventual amnesty is a big change for Ryan.For decades, he's sided with business interests which have worked with Democratic legislators to flood the country with tens of millions of lower-wage, lower-skilled, government-dependent immigrants. Ryan did nothing while those migrants pushed up to seven million blue-collar and white-collar working-age American men out of the job market -- but now he's reacting after seeing how GOP voters repaid the favor by pushing his immigration-touting GOP peers out of the primary race.But Ryan still hasn't accepted the reality that his party's  base -- plus many independents and Democrats -- really don't want to be treated just as replaceable workers in an elite-run world economy.Each year, 4 million Americans turn 18 years old and begin entering the workforce. But, each year, the federal government also imports 2 million foreign workers -- legal immigrants, guest-workers, refugees and asylum seekers and illegal immigrants -- to compete for jobs against Americans. The inflow of professionals and blue-collar workers drives down the salaries of American white-collar and blue-collar workers while boosting income for investors and employers. The inflow also crowds the schools used by the children of lower-income Americans, sharply increases tax transfers from Americans to immigrants, reduces innovation and productivity, pushes many lower-skilled Americans out of the workforce, and enables large-scale violence by immigrant communities against Americans who do not live in protected neighborhoods.Polls show that Americans don't want to compete for jobs against cheap-labor immigrants, illegal or legal, and they don't want to see their children forced into low-wage jobs alongside clannish groups of foreign-language migrants. Americans want to be nice to immigrants -- but almost 90 percent says companies should hire Americans before importing more workers. 
What I've always believed is that you need to retool the legal system so that it fits the economy's needs ... transition our legal [immigration] system so that visas are given to what are needed for the economy. Do we have a shortage of dairy workers in western Wisconsin? Yes, we do.

He also broke with protocol by choosing Archbishop William Tobin of Indianapolis, a relatively small archdiocese never before considered important enough to have a cardinal at its helm.On the other hand, the Pope passed over the conservative archbishops of Philadelphia, Detroit and Los Angeles--Charles Chaput, Allen Vigneron and Jose Gomez, respectively--despite the fact that their three important archdioceses have in recent memory always been considered ""cardinalatial sees.""Archbishop Chaput was responsible for bringing Pope Francis to the United States in September 2015, hosting the pontiff for the World Meeting of Families.Veteran Vatican analyst John Allen noted that with his new appointments, Pope Francis had engineered a ""seismic shift"" in the Catholic hierarchy in the United States, and by naming just progressives, ""Francis was making a statement about the direction in which he wants the American church to go.""The Pope's picks also underscore the very real divisions within the U.S. Catholic bishops conference.A year ago, Archbishops Cupich and Chaput faced off over a theologically indefensible op-ed published by the Chicago Archbishop that suggested that abortion was no more important than a number of other social justice issues such as unemployment, immigration and capital punishment.In a signed essay in the Chicago Tribune, Archbishop Cupich listed a series of social ills that he said people should find ""just as appalling"" as the gruesome ripping apart of unborn children and the sale of their organs by Planned Parenthood.While applauding the strong reaction to the Planned Parenthood videos, Cupich immediately added: ""We should be no less appalled by the indifference toward the thousands of people who die daily for lack of decent medical care; who are denied rights by a broken immigration system and by racism; who suffer in hunger, joblessness and want; who pay the price of violence in gun-saturated neighborhoods; or who are executed by the state in the name of justice.""A week later, Archbishop Chaput responded with a sharp rebuke to Cupich in his own diocesan newspaper, Catholic Philly. In his article, bearing the pithy title ""There is no equivalence,"" Chaput stated: ""The deliberate killing of innocent life is a uniquely wicked act. No amount of contextualizing or deflecting our attention to other issues can obscure that.""This was not the first time that Archbishop Cupich has ""contextualized"" the evil of abortion.A regular contributor to the Jesuit magazine America, in 2008, Cupich wrote a piece against racism, just prior to the presidential election that saw Barack Obama elected president. In it, he suggested that voting on the basis of race is morally equivalent to voting for a pro-abortion candidate.For his part, Indianapolis Archbishop William Tobin has also been critical of America's culture wars, and publicly clashed with Republic vice presidential nominee Mike Pence over the idea of welcoming Syrian refugees into the Archdiocese of Indianapolis.Sunday's nominations represent an important step in Francis's project of shifting emphases within Church, as well as his move toward more global representation among the college of cardinals. The bulk of the new cardinals come from outside Europe, hailing from Africa, Asia, South America, and Oceania.The sole Italian elector the Vatican's ambassador to Syria, Archbishop Mario Zenari.The ceremony for the creation of the new cardinals will be held on November 19, at the conclusion of the Jubilee Year of Mercy.Follow Thomas D.

As we have said this is all planned in secrecy.Asheville, North Carolina; Rutland, Vermont; Reno, Nevada;Ithaca, New York; Missoula, Montana; Aberdeen, South Dakota; Charleston, West Virginia; Fayetteville, Arkansas; Blacksburg, Virginia; Pittsfield, Massachusetts; Northhampton, Massachusetts; Flint, Michigan; Bloomington, Indiana; Traverse City, Michigan.Secrecy was key to the planned resettlement of Syrian refugees in Rutland, Vermont, as Judicial Watch reports:The documents include an April 14, 2016, email from Amila Merdzanovic, executive director of the Vermont Refugee Resettlement Program, to Mayor Christopher Louras, in which she wrote:I want to share with you the concern my HQ has about holding a public forum. If we open it up to anybody and everybody, all sorts of people will come out of woodwork. Anti-immigrant, anti-anything. They suggest that the forum be invite only but make it as wide as possible. Work with faith leaders, United Way, etc... Perhaps, we could go back to the Congregational Church and continue the conversation there.The mayor and resettlement organizations shrouded the plan in such secrecy that not even the town's aldermen were informed of what was taking place behind closed doors. The aldermen eventually wrote to the U.S. Department of State protesting the plan and opened an investigation into the mayor's actions. The State Department has not yet ruled on whether it will resettle refugees in Rutland despite the aldermen's protest.The Vermont Refugee Resettlement Program is the local affiliate of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (U.S.C.R.I) , one of the nine national voluntary agencies (VOLAGs) who receive more than $1 billion annually in federal funding to resettle refugees across the country.As Breitbart News reported previously, the Chief Executive Officer of U.S.C.R.I, Lavinia Limon, was the director of the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement during the Bill Clinton administration. She is one of the architects of the policy that rejects traditional American assimilation of refugees and immigrants into the country and promotes, instead, ""an aggressive multi-culturalism"" described as ""integration"" by proponents, but known as ""balkanization"" or ""disintegration"" by critics.During FY 2016, the Obama administration resettled more than 12,500 Syrian refugees in the United States, out of a total of 84,995 resettled refugees.Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has said she wants to increase the number of Syrian refugees coming in to the United States to 65,000 annually. Donald Trump, in contrast, is ""committed to suspending the Syrian refugee program and programs and immigration from areas of the world that have been compromised by terrorism.""The Obama administration has proposed increasing the total number of refugees allowed into the United States in FY 2017 to 110,000. During the first six days of October 2016, the beginning of FY 2017, the Obama administration brought in more than 3,000 refugees, an annualized rate of 185,000 refugees.As Judicial Watch reports, the concealment efforts runs deep in Rutland, Vermont:Handwritten notes state that the issue was, ""Not what can 'we' do for 'them,' but what the diversity, cultural richness do for the community."" The documents contain detailed discussions of what Rutland will need to provide for the refugees - including housing, jobs, medical care, and places for worship.Judicial Watch received the documents in response to a Vermont Public Records Law request to the office of Mayor Christopher Louras.Merdzanovic later told the Boston Globe that the hidden talks were ""the right thing to do -- to move slowly, keep it to a small circle of people, and then expand.""On April 10, 2016, she wrote to the director of the State Refugee Office about her coordination with the mayor to keep the resettlement program secret:He did share with me that the Governor's office called him after getting a frantic call from DOL [Vermont Department of Labor] inquiring about the plan to resettle '100 Syrians in the next month' in Rutland.

More than 68,000 fraud complaints have been filed in the region in the region from at least 40 disasters since 2005's Hurricane Katrina.Green said that over 50,000 of those complaints have been referred to local authorities and law enforcement agencies.Scammers following disasters usually come in the form of federal emergency aid and phony contractors who are looking to scam homeowners.Green told the media that fraudsters are already defrauding residents who have seen disaster during Hurricane Matthew. He said they have already received one call coming in about a scam.This is not the first case where Louisiana flood victims have seen more than just flood disaster, but also a blackout of media coverage, obliviousness from politicians and a lack of monetary help from donors.As Breitbart Texas reported, donations for Louisiana's 2016 flood victims have been far less compared to the donations that came in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy.Additionally, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has been largely criticized for their slow response and lack of help to Louisiana flood victims, as Breitbart Texas reported.Almost a month after the storm touched down in the region, FEMA had only set up one ""manufactured housing unit"" in the area, despite more than 100,000 damaged homes and 60,000 homes fully destroyed.Two weeks after the storm, more than 1,400 residents remained in shelters, as a large number of homeowners did not carry flood insurance because the region had never flooded in the past.John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas.

""I would crucify her."" ""We have to destroy her story."" These are just some of the things said and done by Hillary Clinton to undermine women who accused her husband, Bill Clinton, of infidelity and even assault.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe Democratic presidential nominee is exploiting a video from 2005 that surfaced Friday, showing her Republican rival, Donald Trump, joking about groping women.Trump, while apologizing, has pointed to Bill Clinton's behavior towards women in the Oval Office and throughout his career -- and Hillary Clinton's role in enabling it.Though Trump is not running against Bill, his defenders have focused on Mrs. Clinton's treatment of the many women who accused her husband of impropriety and even assault -- including Monica Lewinsky, Juanita Broaddrick, and others.The Washington Post recently recalled the pattern of Hillary Clinton's defenses of her husband against what she called ""bimbo eruptions"":... Hillary Clinton dismissed an accusation made by Gennifer Flowers, the singer who sold her story to a supermarket tabloid after having previously denied an affair. In an ABC News interview, she called Flowers ""some failed cabaret singer who doesn't even have much of a resume to fall back on."" She told Esquire magazine in 1992 that if she had the chance to cross-examine Flowers, ""I mean, I would crucify her.""The Post noted: ""Six years later, Bill Clinton acknowledged a sexual encounter with Flowers.""It added that when the Lewinsky scandal emerged, in which Clinton had oral sex with the then-White House intern in the Oval Office, Hillary Clinton refused to credit the story of his accuser, choosing to believe her husband's lies instead. She reportedly called Lewinsky a ""narcissistic loony toon.""Former Bill Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos, now an anchor for ABC News, wrote in his memoir All Too Human: A Political Education that Hillary Clinton had to ""savage her enemies"" during the Lewinsky affair, repeating a pattern from previous scandals involving her husband's behavior towards women.In 1991, for example, when a woman named Connie Hamzy emerged to accuse Bill Clinton of having an affair with her, Hillary Clinton said, ""We have to destroy her story,"" according to Stephanopoulos.

He did what he did. His comments are disgusting and absolutely unacceptable, we are against it,"" Zell told Israel's Army Radio. But ""he said he's not perfect, he apologized.""He added that there is ""no chance"" Trump will quit.According to Zell, Trump's decade-old comments pale in comparison to Hillary Clinton's offenses, not least of which are the leaked emails - also released over the weekend - showing her questionable relationship with Wall Street.""The public wants Trump, with all of his shortcomings, over Clinton with her failures, her corruption, her lies,"" he said.""I have five daughters and they will all, all, vote for Trump,"" Zell added.As several GOP leaders announced the withdrawal of support for Trump following the audio's release, Zell called on Republicans to band together.""I call upon all the Republican leadership, who understand like we do that we need a change to the White House immediately and undo eight years of damage caused by Obama and Clinton to the United States around the world -- to unite and to support the ticket, from the top to the bottom,"" Zell said.Meanwhile, Trump's campaign manager in Israel Tzvika Brot told Army Radio that it ""was good he regretted [his comments], but he isn't running for chief rabbi. There are only perfect leaders in Hollywood.""Brot added that both Republicans and Democrats had not necessarily wanted both candidates as their first choice but despite this ""the parties are standing behind them.""A Facebook page for Republicans Abroad Israel called on supporters to stick by Trump.""When your team is under attack, you RALLY AROUND THE FLAG, YOU DON'T BURN IT AND RUN,"" one posting read.Zell, an international lawyer based in Jerusalem, did not support Trump early in the campaign but later changed his mind. Zell maintains that among the reasons for his change of heart was witnessing Trump's staggering success in the primaries - winning 37 states to beat out 16 other candidates in the race.""First and foremost, the people have spoken, and they have spoken in an unequivocal fashion,"" the Washington DC native told the Times of Israel in August.Zell also praised the Republican platform for dropping the notion of the ""two-state solution"" as an answer to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.""I'm against unrealistic policies. I am against trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. There's no context in which a two-state solution in today's world would work.""He said the GOP nominee also deserved accolades for bringing topics that have been taboo in previous elections to the fore - NATO, immigration and American trade agreements to name a few.""Here's a guy who, just by the unorthodox manner of campaigning, introduced these topics into public debate. That's fantastic. This shows already his ability to influence public opinion and to change the order of things,"" he said.Zell, who is a Princeton graduate, praised Trump's ability to detect the electorate's ire over the current political establishment, the report said.""He understood this, either instinctively or deliberately, and he tapped into that groundswell of discontent and rode it to (nomination) victory,"" he said.""The system needs to be shaken up, both domestically and in terms of foreign policy.""SIGN UP"

He did not say why he could not ask Clinton about the specific speech to which Tapper had referred, and which has been widely reported.Finally, Tapper asked his guest whether a Clinton/Kane administration would mean ""open borders,"" and Kaine reiterated his support for ""comprehensive immigration reform"" with ""more border security.""Joel B.

""India has always violated at Line of Control and ceasefire accord,"" he also said. ""Pakistan had never violated at the LoC.""""All political parties are united on the issue of Kashmir,"" he added and urged the world community to pay attention to human rights violations in the occupied Kashmir.On Monday, the Russian-led U.N. Security Council (UNSC), considered the most powerful body of the alliance, decided to ignore the growing tensions between India and Pakistan in Kashmir.The decision comes after U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed deep concerns over the significant increase in tensions between India and Pakistan in the wake of recent developments in Kashmir, particularly military clashes between the two countries along the border that separates their respective Kashmir regions in violation of the 2003 ceasefire.""He calls on the Governments of Pakistan and India to address their outstanding issues, including regarding Kashmir, peacefully through diplomacy and dialogue. His good offices are available, if accepted by both sides,"" said a spokesman for Ban in a statement issued Sept. 30.That same day, Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan's UN ambassador, pleaded with U.N. secretary-general  to intervene in what she referred to as a ""dangerous"" situation between the two nuclear-armed rivals.""This is a dangerous moment for the region,"" Lodhi said after meeting with Ban at UN headquarters in New York. ""The time has come for bold intervention by him if we are to avoid a crisis, because we can see a crisis building up.""The U.N. chief has reportedly offered to mediate efforts to defuse escalating tensions between India and Pakistan.On Tuesday, day after the Russian-led U.N. Security Council said it was planning to address the India-Pakistan confrontations over Kashmir, a spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said the commissioner, ""is seriously concerned about the human rights situation in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir, as well as the rising tensions between India and Pakistan.""In public, India and Pakistan have expressed a willingness to defuse the rising tensions. However, both countries accuse one another of provocations that have led to ceasefire violations. They both appear to have preconditions for peace.While India has long accused Pakistan for providing military assistance and training to rebels and even some terrorists fighting in Kashmir for independence from India or to merge the region with Pakistan, Islamabad has accused India of cracking down on dissent among the Muslim-majority population of Kashmir seeking independence from India or a merger with Pakistan.About a year ago, Islamabad also accused India of backing terrorist groups, namely the Pakistani Taliban known as Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, reported The Hindu.Meanwhile, India has accused Pakistan of backing terrorist groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).New Delhi blames Islamabad for helping LeT foment unrest in Kashmir.SIGN UP"

The company will redeploy some assets from its DHL Express operations to establish a parcels network in the two countries next year, she said.She said similar initiatives using existing assets would take precedence over big acquisitions.""We feel the house is the way we want it to be,"" she said, adding that further deals would add ""a nice piece of furniture"".The growing popularity of internet shopping was driving demand for its parcels services, she said.In Germany, where it had 44 percent of the market in 2015, the group is expecting a record Christmas. ""We have on average 4 million parcels a day (...) we expect in the pre-Christmas peak to go up to 8 million parcels,"" she said.BREXIT OPPORTUNITYKreis said she was personally sad about Brexit, but the group had traded through many political and financial upheavals in the more than 220 countries where it operates and it would take Brexit in its stride.""The big noticeable thing at this point is the devaluation in the pound, but in terms of real underlying trading we don't see any deterioration in growth rates,"" she said.Brexit could be an opportunity, she said.""We are also very experienced in dealing with situations where there are trade regulations and complex customs regimes, that to a certain degree is something we sell to our customers,"" she said. ""Complex customs regulations are something where you as a logistics company can show your strength.""In terms of Deutsche Post's financial strategy, Kreis said the message was one of continuity.She wants to maintain the group's triple B plus credit rating, keep to its guidance of paying 40-60 percent of net profit as dividends, and redistribute excess liquidity to shareholders or use it to fund pensions.After a year beset by strikes, the company, which provides one in 200 German jobs, is rebuilding its profits.

The Paycheck Fairness Act would strengthen the Equal Pay Act by holding employers responsible for proving that pay differences between men and women are based on a qualification that's a business necessity and not gender. The Act would also ban companies from retaliating against employees who raise concerns about gender-based wage discrimination in the workplace.

 You know, the Lilly Ledbetter case which established firmly the absolute right to be paid equally for equal work was a great step forward, but if people don't know about it, if they don't have a safe harbor to go to to get somebody to advocate for them, you know, it's not going to increase the number of women being paid what they should be paid.  So I think first and foremost, we have to enforce the law.
Fixing the ""gender pay gap"" has become a staple of Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton's stump speech but in a speech to the Accenture Women's Leadership Forum in October 2012, Clinton claimed that the laws to fix the problem are already on the books.  The transcript of her speech was included in the release of 2,050 emails by Wikileaks on Friday.  on Fridayon Friday This rhetoric from Clinton about the laws already being there to fix the gender pay gap are in stark contrast to other comments she has made on the campaign trail.

""Keeping this information confidential is essential if investigations are to run their course.""""We must find a way of getting mayors involved in preventing radicalisation in a way that does not hamper the efforts of the intelligence services,"" Cazeneuve added.

""If the state won't provide this information, I demand that they take the responsibility for removing these people from my town.""Conservative presidential hopeful Nicolas Sarkozy, who was president of France from 2007 to 2012, said on Friday that if he was re-elected he would immediately hold a referendum on whether ""the most dangerous suspects on the 'Fiche S' should be kept in administrative detention"".Cazeneuve rejected this view: ""Detaining individuals who haven't committed any crime just because they have been caught by the radar of the intelligence services is inefficient, unconstitutional and contrary to the values of the French Republic.""He insisted that the intelligence services efforts were paying off, citing the arrest this year of 355 people with alleged links to terror groups.""Less than 20 people have managed to leave the country [to fight overseas] since the beginning of the year,"" he said.The 'Fiche S' watch listThe ""S"" (which stands for Safety of the state) is a police and intelligence designation that has existed since the late 1960s.It is used to describe anyone who is a potential security threat. It is not restricted to potential Islamist terrorists, but also includes (among others) football hooligans, extreme right and left-wing activists and radical environmentalists.Last week, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said there were currently 10,500 people on the ""Fiche S"" watch list, which has 16 sub-categories based on an individual's threat potential.Islamists who have travelled overseas to wage jihad and have since returned to France are categorised as ""S14"".SIGN UP"

Police are questioning two Syrians in connection with her death.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe girl was discovered by passersby in a lifeless state in a stairwell on September 27. Medical staff were initially able to resuscitate the 15 year old, and took her to hospital, but she died yesterday of what toxicology reports indicate was a cocaine overdose.Shortly after the girl was discovered in Innsbruck, police brought a Syrian man in for questioning in relation to the case. The 22 year old told officials that he and a friend had watched through a window and seen two Moroccan men moving the girl to the stairwell.In subsequent interrogations, police found the Syrian's story to be full of contradictions and a second Syrian national was questioned. Eventually, they had to admit the girl had consumed drugs and alcohol in their apartment.The two men had moved the girl outside when she lost consciousness as they were afraid they would get in trouble with the police, the Tiroler Tageszeitung reported.The two men, both of whom have been granted asylum, are blaming one another for the girl's death. ""They accuse each other. One Syrian says that the other gave the girl the cocaine and vice versa"", an investigator working on the case told Kronen Zeitung.According to the spokesman for the Innsbruck prosecutor, Hansjorg Mayr, the men are suspected of giving narcotic drugs to a minor and of failure to assist a wounded person. The Syrians are not being held in custody.A report on migrant crime released in March revealed that for every 100 people who attempt to claim asylum in Austria an average of 55 criminal offences are committed. The Austrian agency of Federal statistics report showed that during the period of 2004 to 2014 almost every other migrant had committed some kind of criminal offence after coming to the country and seeking asylum.SIGN UP"

Security Council resolution on Saturday that would have demanded an end to air strikes and military flights over Syria's city of Aleppo, while a rival Russian draft text failed to get a minimum nine votes in favor.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERMoscow's text was effectively the French draft with Russian amendments. It removed the demand for an end to air strikes on Aleppo and put the focus back on a failed Sept. 9 U.S./Russia ceasefire deal, which was annexed to the draft.British U.N. Ambassador Matthew Rycroft told Russian U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin: ""Thanks to your actions today, Syrians will continue to lose their lives in Aleppo and beyond to Russian and Syrian bombing. Please stop now.""Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces, backed by Russian war planes and Iranian support, have been battling to capture eastern Aleppo, the rebel-held half of Syria's largest city, where more than 250,000 civilians are trapped.""Russia has become one of the chief purveyors of terror in Aleppo, using tactics more commonly associated with thugs than governments,"" U.S. Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations David Pressman told the council.He said Russia was ""intent on allowing the killing to continue and, indeed, participating in carrying it out"" and that what was needed from Moscow was ""less talk and more action from them to stop the slaughter.""A U.N. resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes to be adopted. The veto powers are the United States, France, Britain, Russia and China. The Russian text only received four votes in favor, so a veto was not needed to block it.The French draft received 11 votes in favor, while China and Angola abstained. Venezuela joined Russia in voting against it.It was the fifth time Russia has used its veto on a U.N. resolution on Syria during the more than five-year conflict.The previous four times China backed Moscow in protecting Syria's government from council action, including vetoing a bid to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. China voted in favor of Russia's draft on Saturday.'STRANGE SPECTACLE'China's U.N. Ambassador Liu Jieyi said some of the content of the French draft ""does not reflect the full respect for the sovereignty, independence, unification and territorial integrity of Syria,"" while the content of the Russian draft did.""We regret that the (Russian draft) resolution was not adopted,"" he told the council.Russia only gained the support of China, Venezuela and Egypt for its draft resolution. Angola and Uruguay abstained, while the remaining nine council members voted against.Churkin, who is council president for October, described the dual votes on Saturday as one of the ""strangest spectacles in the history of the Security Council.""""Given that the crisis in Syria is at a critical stage, when it is particularly important that there be a coordination of the political efforts of the international community, this waste of time is inadmissible,"" Churkin told the council.Syrian government forces recaptured territory from insurgents in several western areas on Saturday.Both the French and Russian U.N. draft resolutions called for a truce and humanitarian aid access throughout Syria.""If we don't so something this town (Aleppo) will soon just be in ruins and will remain in history as a town in which the inhabitants were abandoned to their executioners,"" French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said. ""If the international community does not wake up it will share the responsibility.""The council negotiated for a week on the text drafted by France. Russia circulated its own draft on Friday and said it would be put to a vote after the French text on Saturday.Angola's U.N. Ambassador Ismael Gaspar Martins said his country abstained on both votes because it did not want to be drawn into the acrimony between the United States and Russia.The United States on Monday suspended talks with Russia on implementing a ceasefire deal in Syria, accusing Moscow of not living up to its commitments to halt fighting and ensure aid reached besieged communities.A crackdown by Assad on pro-democracy protesters in 2011 sparked a civil war and Islamic State militants have used the chaos to seize territory in Syria and Iraq. Half of Syria's 22 million people have been uprooted and more than 400,000 killed.SIGN UP"
