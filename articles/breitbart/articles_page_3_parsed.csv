It will happen in the next couple of weeks,"" Trump'a advance team director, George Gigicos, confirmed to reporters at Trump Tower on Friday.The tour will take place after Thanksgiving, according to Gigicos, but it remains unclear exactly what Trump has planned.Trump's political presidential rallies defined his campaign, drawing tens of thousands of supporters across the country. They have also been a focal point for violence and protests from leftists opposing his campaign, who will undoubtedly try to disrupt his attempt to rally the country.Trump has remained largely silent since making brief remarks to the media during his visit with President Obama at the White House shortly after winning the election. He remains at Trump Tower planning his administration and focusing on his transition into power.SIGN UP"	['Trump', 'Obama']	[]

""Got 'em!"" concludes meme Biden.And the use of the levers of federal and executive power Democrats have created for years against them by Trump and the Republican House and Senate is likely. A few days after the election, retiring Senator David Vitter suggested using the federal purse strings to regulate sanctuary cities that take a secessionist approach to immigration law:Withholding fed $ from #sanctuarycities puts clear, negative consequences for jurisdictions ignoring federal law. https://t.co/M7zYALucs7-- David Vitter (@DavidVitter) November 16, 2016The policy areas that could - or should - feel the pressure of a federal government expanded by President Obama, Senator Reid, and Congresswoman Pelosi but now controlled by President-elect Trump, are numerous.A prime candidate is education policy.This is potentially a contentious issue. Trump supporters include a healthy portion of people who have hated ""common core,"" Michelle Obama's inedible school lunches, and other federal interventions in local schools. One of Trump's rumored candidates for Secretary of Education, Stanford University academic Williamson Evers, is one of the chief critics of common core and other federal interventions in education.But one issue stands out as a more fundamental, often described as a civil rights issue: school choice. And school choice was one policy Trump ran on, especially when campaigning in urban areas among minority voters trapped in failed traditional public school systems, with the President-elect proposing shifting $20 billion of the Department of Education's budget into funding for local school voucher programs modeled on Washington, D.C.'s Opportunity Vouchers.One of the dirty secrets of education in America is that American students receive separate and unequal educations.In Washington, D.C., for example, where 45 percent of the students have left the city's largely failed traditional public schools  - D.C. ranks last after the 50 states, with a 69 percent graduation rate - for charter schools (and to a lesser degree private schools using the Congressionally mandated Opportunity Scholars voucher program), a child receives a radically unequal amount of public funding depending on where they choose to go to school.D.C. traditional public school students earn the public school system $29,000 each (the highest per pupil budget in the nation aside from Manhattan and a few other jurisdictions).  But kids in charter schools are only budgeted in the low $20,000s.And kids using the Opportunity Vouchers to go to a private or parochial school receive $13,000. Even more remarkably the recipient of the vouchers in D.C. are overwhelmingly African American, while the most contented parents and students in the traditional public schools are the mainly white bureaucrats and lobbyists who live in the million dollar plus housing in posh sections of Capitol Hill and Upper NW and send their kids to the well tended public schools in their wealthy neighborhoods.Public school systems don't like to share the data about their radically unequal school funding (or their sometimes disastrous graduation rates), but school choice reformers tell me the unequal funding one finds in Washington, D.C. is true across the country.So why not tie federal funding of education (or of highways or anything else), to ending the discrimination against children who choose to be educated outside of the traditional, politician and teacher's union dominated, public schools?  Why shouldn't the amount of public money budgeted for a child's education be the same no matter where she goes to school?It should be a popular move.The number of students attending charter schools is on the rise, and so are the number of politicians running on the issue.In a little over 2 percent of the 6,000 races for state houses and legislatures this November, one relatively new political group backed candidates and had an extremely high success rate. ""If the teacher's unions spent more than any other political entity, but can only point to a handful of local races where those they supported won, that speaks for itself,"" says Matt Frendewey of the American Federation for Children.The American Federation for Children supported 120 state and local 2016 candidates who ran on expanding school choice - including charter schools, vouchers, and tax credits - and by Frendeway's count 108 of them won.In one race the AFC did not get involved in, a Republican, Ashley Carter, dislodged a 10 year incumbent for the D.C. city wide at-large seat on the school board (in a technically non-partisan race).  (Though she did campaign on school choice issues, Carter says not being the incumbent in such a failed system, and going to hundreds of events and listening to people in every Ward is what helped her win.)Though school choice is often associated with Republican (and Libertarian) candidates, a growing number of Democrats, especially urban and African American Democrats whose constituents are trapped in failing traditional public school systems, have also come out for school choice.AFC does not support candidates for federal office, but notes that of the Democratic victories for the House of Representatives last week, three were pro-school choice candidates: Al Lawson (FL), Darren Soto (FL), and Dwight Evans (PA).AFC, less than a decade old, spent $5 million supporting pro-school choice candidates (down from $8 million it spent in previous election cycles, when it was involved in opposing the recall election of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker).The American Federation of Teachers, in opposition to whom the American Federation of Children takes its name, also claimed victories in the election.""When the issue was whether to support its community public schools, communities said 'yes.' Voters chose to protect and support the institution of public education. You can see this in the defeat of measures to expand charter schools, in the passage of measures to invest in public education, and in the support of school board members who will work with educators to provide a high-quality public education for all children,"" Randi Weingarten, the president of AFT said. ""These victories send a strong message that Americans want our schools to use proven, evidence-based solutions to the challenges that hold children back.""Yet in the AFT's press release ""Americans Voted for Public Schools over Privatization"" the elections where candidates or initiatives favoring more taxes for and investment in traditional public schools and limits on the expansion of charter schools and other education alternatives won were limited to Detroit, San Francisco, and a very small number of other very Democratic jurisdictions.AFT and the National Education Association had spent nearly twenty times as much money on electoral activities.  The two groups (and their state affiliates), which unlike AFC, do support candidates in federal elections, had concentrated some resources on the presidential race in support of Hillary Clinton.The NEA's headquarters building in D.C., located a few blocks north of the White House, was bedecked for months with a large banner in support of Mrs. Clinton's presidential bid.Pollsters are widely believed to have failed in their predictions for this election cycle, but the American Federation for Children commissioned a poll in January 2016 that predicted that 70 percent of American voters would support a pro-school choice candidate.With such wide support in polls for school choice, and with the number of students leaving traditional public schools growing, making receiving federal funds conditional on treating all students equally should be a popular issue.

Reilly at the Huffington Post writes the following about President-elect Donald Trump's choice of Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions as U.S. Attorney General.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFrom The Huffington Post:President-elect Donald Trump has reportedly offered Republican Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions -- who was rejected as a federal judge in 1986 due to allegations of racist comments -- the position of attorney general.Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III, 69, would serve as the nation's top law enforcement official if nominated by Trump and confirmed by his fellow members of the Senate. Sessions, an early Trump backer, is an immigration hard-liner who has been in the Senate since 1997 and previously served as attorney general for the state of Alabama.Back in the mid-1980s, when Sessions was U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Alabama, President Ronald Reagan nominated him to become a federal judge. But during the nomination process, allegations emerged that Sessions had called a black attorney ""boy,"" that he suggested a white civil rights lawyer was a race traitor, that he joked he liked the Ku Klux Klan until he found out they smoked marijuana and that he referred to civil rights groups as ""un-American"" organizations trying to ""force civil rights down the throats of people who were trying to put problems behind them.""Read the rest here.

""I ran across one where a woman actually went for counseling because her roommate used the word 'bitch' with respect to her. Two other students ran in for counseling because they saw a mouse, and they needed counseling."" ""Others have talked about a national pantywaist crisis, political correctness run amok, a generation of young people that have never had the opportunity to solve their own problems,"" he noted. ""They don't seem to have as much grit as previous generations. We have helicopter parents; kid gets anything less than an A, and not only is the kid upset, the parents are swooping in. So when it comes to something which, you know, can be a little bit more upsetting than a mouse - which is our national election and people who are being appointed - it is not at all surprising that they're acting like that."" ""The point that I tried to make in my piece is, it's bad enough when it happens at the undergraduate level. But when it happens in a law school, like the University of Michigan, where they had Play-Doh and bubbles and so on, it is much more serious because those kids are adults. You could maybe see it in an 18-year-old, away from home for the first time. Okay, they're a little upset. But 23-year-olds who have gone through four years of college, and they're still demanding Play-Doh in order to function? That's wrong,"" Banzhaf declared.Marlow disagreed only in that he thought even high school students and college freshmen should not be coddled and infantilized this way. Banzhaf concurred with the notion that treating young adults like pre-schoolers ""makes them think like pre-schoolers.""""We have many psychological studies that say if teachers treat somebody a certain way, they're going to tend to act that way,"" Banzhaf said. ""But again, I agree with you that it shouldn't be happening at the lower levels, but it's more serious - and then also, think of the majors. If it turns out that, in grad school, physics majors lack fortitude, history majors were wusses, geology majors were pantywaists, it wouldn't be too serious because we don't demand that kind of thing."" ""But when it happens to law students, it means we will have, we're already having, a generation of wuss lawyers who cannot provide effective representation for individuals in court and agencies elsewhere,"" he argued. ""It means not just the individuals, but the causes  - you know, so many of our important issues wind up being resolved in courts, whether that's gun rights or transgender rights or religious liberties. So if somebody representing a religious liberty isn't effectively represented by that lawyer, lots of people could be affected. We have important topics which are no longer being discussed, so kids are graduating from law school not knowing anything about rape or affirmative action or executions, which means not only are they ineffective, but it also means the professors who teach those courses are no longer doing that research.""""And then, finally, the one I think you and I would be most concerned about is that we have a generation of lawyers - and also undergrads - who are so supersensitive to any words, they are obviously less respectful, less concerned about the First Amendment, more willing to censor speech, more willing to censor speakers, keep them off campus, disinvite them, shout them down when they're there. And these law students who are going to be the presidents of universities, and faculty, and administrators, advisers, they're going to say: 'Well yeah, of course it may be protected by the First Amendment, but you can't have somebody like X coming on campus and saying such horrible things about our students,'"" Banzhaf warned.Marlow mentioned a story about San Francisco's teachers union producing an anti-Trump curriculum in which public school children are to be taught that ""a racist and sexist man has become the president of our country by pandering to a huge racist and sexist base."" Confusingly, the lesson plan also advises teachers not to tell their students that Hillary Clinton lost the election.""Well, Alex, let's not be surprised about this,"" Banzhaf responded. ""This is the same generation where they grew up playing sports, but nobody ever won. Not telling them Hillary lost is like telling them that your team didn't lose, whether you get more points - actually, they don't even count points in many of these cases - but the kids are playing soccer or some other sport, and they tell them both sides won, and everybody gets trophies just for showing up. Well, of course they're going to have this kind of attitude.

""Once he speaks out, they may be encouraged to do so, or at the very least, it provides a basis for the discussion of topics we don't often hear about on campus.""Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.LISTEN:SIGN UPSiriusXM host Alex Marlow ran through some of the more ridiculous methods people on the Left have employed to cope with their emotional devastation after the 2016 election, most of which involve treating grown men and women like small children, giving them toys and puppies to work out their anxiety.""I'm not at all surprised that they're getting so upset about political developments because they do this in other areas,"" said Prof. Banzhaf. ""I ran across one where a woman actually went for counseling because her roommate used the word 'bitch' with respect to her. Two other students ran in for counseling because they saw a mouse, and they needed counseling."" ""Others have talked about a national pantywaist crisis, political correctness run amok, a generation of young people that have never had the opportunity to solve their own problems,"" he noted. ""They don't seem to have as much grit as previous generations. We have helicopter parents; kid gets anything less than an A, and not only is the kid upset, the parents are swooping in. So when it comes to something which, you know, can be a little bit more upsetting than a mouse - which is our national election and people who are being appointed - it is not at all surprising that they're acting like that."" ""The point that I tried to make in my piece is, it's bad enough when it happens at the undergraduate level. But when it happens in a law school, like the University of Michigan, where they had Play-Doh and bubbles and so on, it is much more serious because those kids are adults. You could maybe see it in an 18-year-old, away from home for the first time. Okay, they're a little upset. But 23-year-olds who have gone through four years of college, and they're still demanding Play-Doh in order to function? That's wrong,"" Banzhaf declared.Marlow disagreed only in that he thought even high school students and college freshmen should not be coddled and infantilized this way. Banzhaf concurred with the notion that treating young adults like pre-schoolers ""makes them think like pre-schoolers.""""We have many psychological studies that say if teachers treat somebody a certain way, they're going to tend to act that way,"" Banzhaf said. ""But again, I agree with you that it shouldn't be happening at the lower levels, but it's more serious - and then also, think of the majors. If it turns out that, in grad school, physics majors lack fortitude, history majors were wusses, geology majors were pantywaists, it wouldn't be too serious because we don't demand that kind of thing."" ""But when it happens to law students, it means we will have, we're already having, a generation of wuss lawyers who cannot provide effective representation for individuals in court and agencies elsewhere,"" he argued. ""It means not just the individuals, but the causes  - you know, so many of our important issues wind up being resolved in courts, whether that's gun rights or transgender rights or religious liberties. So if somebody representing a religious liberty isn't effectively represented by that lawyer, lots of people could be affected. We have important topics which are no longer being discussed, so kids are graduating from law school not knowing anything about rape or affirmative action or executions, which means not only are they ineffective, but it also means the professors who teach those courses are no longer doing that research.""""And then, finally, the one I think you and I would be most concerned about is that we have a generation of lawyers - and also undergrads - who are so supersensitive to any words, they are obviously less respectful, less concerned about the First Amendment, more willing to censor speech, more willing to censor speakers, keep them off campus, disinvite them, shout them down when they're there. And these law students who are going to be the presidents of universities, and faculty, and administrators, advisers, they're going to say: 'Well yeah, of course it may be protected by the First Amendment, but you can't have somebody like X coming on campus and saying such horrible things about our students,'"" Banzhaf warned.Marlow mentioned a story about San Francisco's teachers union producing an anti-Trump curriculum in which public school children are to be taught that ""a racist and sexist man has become the president of our country by pandering to a huge racist and sexist base."" Confusingly, the lesson plan also advises teachers not to tell their students that Hillary Clinton lost the election.""Well, Alex, let's not be surprised about this,"" Banzhaf responded. ""This is the same generation where they grew up playing sports, but nobody ever won. Not telling them Hillary lost is like telling them that your team didn't lose, whether you get more points - actually, they don't even count points in many of these cases - but the kids are playing soccer or some other sport, and they tell them both sides won, and everybody gets trophies just for showing up. Well, of they're going to have this kind of attitude. We should not be at all surprised.""He pointed out that the second part of his new article expressed ""the hope that once Trump comes in, this can be changed, and by his pen and his bully pulpit, in what some might think of as a kind of poetic justice because he's causing so much of this, that he can reverse it.""In other words, Banzhaf suggested that ""by cutting back on the requirements that we have to deal with rape to the point where people's rights are upset, by cutting back on the federal pressure to stamp out every arguably racist, sexist statement on campus, and so on, we can fight back.""

The bad news - as you can tell from some of the ministerial comments - is that it serves to remind us that Britain's climate and energy policy is still in thrall to the environmentalist lunacy which wiser heads like Donald Trump are trying to write out of history.Wiser heads? Donald Trump?? Yes, I can almost hear the sneering and the jeering from the usual suspects.But even if you disagree with Trump's environmental and energy policy - which I don't - it remains an unarguable fact that the world's most powerful nation is heading in a very clear direction for at least the next four years: pro-fossil-fuels, anti-renewables. This is going to have a massive, largely positive impact on the U.S. economy because by bringing down the cost of energy, it will give consumers more disposable income and enable businesses - especially in energy-intensive heavy industry - to increase their profit margins or cut costs to the benefit of their bottom line.At this point, America's global economic competitors have one of two options: either they wake up and smell the coffee and move in America's direction; or they bury their heads in the sand, pretend we're still living in the status quo ante and sit, helpless, while America's new higher-carbon economy steals half of their business.Judging by the comments of the Minister for Climate Change and Industry - about as fatuous a title as being Minister for Veganism and Meat - Britain has already made up her mind:""The UK is ratifying the historic Paris Agreement so that we can help to accelerate global action on climate change and deliver on our commitments to create a safer, more prosperous future for us all,"" Nick Hurd, Minister of State for Climate Change and Industry, said.""We are going to use this positive momentum to grow the UK low-carbon sector, which is already worth over 46 billion pounds, as we continue to provide secure, affordable and clean energy to our families and businesses,"" he said.Nick Hurd, it should be noted, had the best education money can buy at Eton. Clearly, it was utterly wasted if this is the sort of bilge he comes up with.What can government-imposed limits on carbon dioxide emissions (which inevitably lead malinvestment, cronyism, tariffs and subsidies) possibly have to do with prosperity? Or indeed safety?It is weapons-grade bollocks and inspires very little faith that Theresa May, despite her axing of the Department of Energy and Climate Change, has any real grasp of the rapidly changing nature of the climate debate. We got a depressing taste of this when she gave the monstrously expensive, outdated, and generally rubbish Hinkley Point C power station the go-ahead.If the even crazier exercise in green virtue-signalling and crony capitalism the Swansea Bay Tidal Project gets approved, we shall know that the government has lost the plot completely.Perhaps had Hillary Clinton won the presidential election, this would make a sort of sense. Britain would be merely going with the flow of international policy.But Trump won and now Britain faces a stark choice, described here by Rupert Darwall who has been in Marrakech at the COP22 conference.Although Britain is formally leaving the EU, its climate and energy policies look set to remain exactly the same. Indeed, when it comes to climate and energy, Britain is being more Catholic than the Pope.The German government has stated its intention to keep burning coal for at least the next two decades; Greg Clark's business department has just launched a consultation on phasing it out by 2025.That is unlikely to play well in Washington, to say the least. Coal is important to Republicans. Over the last two years, Britain imported 16.5 million tonnes of coal from America, worth $1.4 billion.Four of the top five coal-producing states voted Republican - including Pennsylvania, which switched from the Democrats. Of the top 10 coal-burning states, seven voted Republican last week, including Vice President-elect Mike Pence's Indiana and swing state Ohio.An iron rule of American politics is that domestic politics trump international considerations. As Henry Kissinger told The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg after the election, Trump's victory ""could enable us to establish coherence between our foreign policy and our domestic situation"".And it is very hard to envisage the Trump Administration looking kindly on a potential trade deal with a partner that is in the process of banning imports of American coal - and putting American miners out of work.So far it looks like Britain is hell bent on taking the wrong decision. Business Secretary Greg Clark looks to be clueless and it seems depressingly likely that all the green activists who infested the defunct Department of Energy and Climate Change have simply been dispersed within other ministries, spreading their environmentalist crony capitalist poison.Here is John Constable's depressing take:The UK's new secretary of state for Business, Greg Clark, has just given his first public speech on energy. It suggests, unfortunately, that he is not yet sufficiently confident of his brief to resist the views of his civil servants. Indeed, this speech could easily have been written for Ed Miliband, or Chris Huhne, or Ed Davey, and suggests that the rent-seeking green interests in the electricity sector are re-injecting themselves into the national bloodstream through an interventionist industrial strategy. This will result in overcapitalisation and reductions in productivity.We have scotched the Green Blob but not killed it. A long hard battle lies ahead of us.

Even after being set straight on Wednesday, the taxpayer-funded outlet continues to defy the facts in its effort to smear the incoming Trump administration and crush a conservative media upstart.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThis time, the lie comes via Kelly McEvers, who filed a slanderous story on Thursday's edition of All Things Considered: ""'We're Not Going Away': Alt-Right Leader On Voice In Trump Administration.""In it, McEvers suggests that because Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K.

He added, ""We gotta bring back the jobs from China, we gotta bring back the jobs from Japan, and all these countries that are ripping us off. And we're gonna do that. And we are gonna do that.""In March, Trump went after manufacturers who relocate production to China, where Apple's assemblers churn out iPhones, iPads and MacBooks. ""How does it help us when they make it in China?""Already referred to as the ""Valley of the Democrats"" for the over 83 percent of Silicon Valley tech CEO and employee donations that went to Democrats in the 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns, Trump's populist comments caused Silicon Valley corporate CEOs to double down on electing a Democrats, with over 99 percent of Silicon Valley's $8.6 million in contributions in the presidential primaries going to Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).Although the final numbers are not in yet, of the $497.8 million Hillary Clinton raised, small individual donations of $200 or less were just $91,522,689, or 18.3 percent. One of her top spots to vacuum up cash was Silicon Valley, where contributions averaged $1,276.The biggest Clinton ""Hillblazer"" political bundler was Apple's chief executive Tim Cook. He personally held a multi-million dollar fundraiser in August that was attended by 375 tech guests paying between $50,000 and $2,700 each.Donald Trump's surprising victory caused Silicon Valley tech stocks to suffer a 9 percent crash, while the rest of the stock market rallied to new all-time-highs.Breitbart News warned that if the Trump administration is moving to ""Make America Great Again!,"" Silicon Valley tech firms could be the prime target of 45 percent tariffs on offshore supply chains, tightened immigration affecting H-1B visas, and a ""trust busting"" wave against unscrupulous monopolistic practices by modern tech corporate ""robber barons.""Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou reportedly told Apple, ""Making iPhones in the U.S. means the cost will more than double."" But that is insignificant, given that the current labor assembly cost is estimated at just $12.50, and that an iPhone 7 with a 32GB memory sells for $649.The real issue for Foxconn moving iPhone assembly to America is China, where they employ about 690,000 workers, which about equals the entire population of Detroit.The other $212.50 in the iPhone 7's cost is associated with components made by Asians. Taiwan Semiconductor makes chips, Japan's Japan Display and Sharp supply handset panels, and South Korea's SK Hynix and Japan's Toshiba produce the memory.Tim Cook had told CBS News' 60 Minutes in December 2015 that Apple could not move its iPhones production back to the U.S., because America lacked enough skilled workers.""Let me be clear, China put an enormous focus on manufacturing, in what you and I would call vocational kind of skills,"" he said. Cook blamed America for Apple's need to move production offshore: ""The U.S., over time, began to stop having as many vocational kind of skills.""It seems that since the election of Donald Trump as President, Apple and soon the rest of Silicon Valley may have discovered that America does have enough skilled workers to make high-tech devices.""Apple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron Corp., the two iPhone assemblers, in June to look into making iPhones in the U.S.,"" a source said.

"On December 4, Italy faces a referendum that could sink the present government and usher in a new populist era, an outcome made more probable by Donald Trump's recent election victory in the U.S.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER""The U.S. elections have shown that a wind of change is blowing across both sides of the Atlantic and will soon wipe [Prime Minister] Renzi away. His time is over and Italy needs a new government,"" said Massimiliano Fedriga, Lower House leader of the conservative Northern League party.On Thursday, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi renewed his vow to step down if the upcoming referendum fails to pass. ""If the citizens vote no and want a decrepit system that does not work, I will not be the one to deal with other parties for a caretaker government,"" Renzi said.At the same time, the Prime Minister reiterated his optimism for the referendum's success, noting that the largest bloc at the moment are the undecideds, who comprise some 37 percent of the voting population. ""For me the silent majority will vote Yes,"" he said, which would eliminate the need for talk about a transitional government or parliamentary elections.Despite Renzi's hopefulness, recent polls suggest that the referendum is headed for defeat, which means that the Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, would have to name the head of an interim government, to be in place until new elections were held.Either way, says Renzi, a ""no"" vote doesn't mean ""Armageddon."" We will simply find ourselves with ""enormous regional repayments and one of the most numerous Parliaments in history,"" he said.Few doubt that some sort of reform of Italy's present political arrangement is necessary. The current system was adopted in 1946 in the wake of the Mussolini dictatorship, and was designed to spread decision-making as broadly as possible. The result was political ineffectiveness and 63 governments since the end of the Italian monarchy.One of Renzi's tasks on taking office in 2014 was to streamline Italy's notorious bureaucracy. Renzi promised reforms aimed at making Italy more governable by significantly shifting the scope and power of the Senate toward the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies. The Senate would be substantially reduced in number and transformed into a ""Senate of Regions,"" with 100 senators made up mostly of regional councilors and mayors. Meanwhile, power would also be taken away from Italy's regions and centralized in Rome.Whether or not this is the best way to reform Italy's political system may prove irrelevant. Recent polls show that few Italians (one in five) actually understand what the referendum is about, which only serves to reduce the Dec. 4 vote to a thumbs-up or thumbs-down to the Renzi government itself.Tying his own permanence in office to the success of the referendum on constitutional reform may turn out to be the worst decision Matteo Renzi ever made. His personal popularity has fallen in the wake of a migrant crisis that shows little signs of abating along with growing dissatisfaction with Italy's participation in the European Union.On the national level, Renzi's Democratic party (PD) is now barely ahead of the populist Five Star Movement (M5S), a Eurosceptic party founded by comedian Beppe Grillo that rejects what it sees as a corrupt political establishment.In June, the M5S saw significant victories in a number of important mayoral elections across the country, including Rome and Turin, wresting power from the ruling PD and galvanizing the young movement's position as Italy's leading opposition party.Grillo's M5S isn't alone in opposing the Renzi referendum, however. Most of what remains of media magnate Silvio Berlusconi's party, Forza Italia, will vote ""no"" on Dec. 4, as will the populist Northern League party.Though hardly in alliance with each other, these parties share a common political foe in Matteo Renzi, which doesn't bode well for the success of Renzi's referendum--or his government.Follow Thomas D.

It is also an inescapable fact that the majority of our success in opposition grew spontaneously and fully from the interactions with our own children and schools and therefore hold specific and direct experience no mere ""policy expert"" could possess.In the letter, which can be signed by others at its website, the parents ask Trump to consider them as the key ""forgotten"" group in education, and to do all within his power ""to see that control over the education of our children is returned to us - PARENTS and GUARDIANS - those best suited to advocate in deference and defense of those being educated at the hands of the taxpayer.""With a goal of ultimately ending the U.S. Department of Education, the parents' recommendations to Trump include:The parents' recommendations for the post of U.S. Secretary of Education include Dr. Williamson (Bill) Evers; Dr. Larry Arnn, president of Hillsdale College; Dr. Sandra Stotsky, standards writer and professor emerita, University of Arkansas;  Dr. Peg Luksik, Pennsylvania constitutionalist and co-founder of the Center for American Heritage; and Dr. William Jeynes, professor of education at California State University, Long Beach.As Breitbart News has reported - and the parents especially note - Evers was invited to be a member of Trump's transition team. A vocal critic of Common Core, Evers is a fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution and served as both an advisor and assistant U.S. Secretary of Education under President George W. Bush. In addition, Evers was named by both former California governors Pete Wilson and Arnold Schwarzenegger to serve on commissions that evaluated and recommended academic standards.In January of 2015, Evers penned an op-ed for Education Week in which he denounced the Common Core State Standards:[I]ncreasingly, parents and taxpayers view the public schools as an unresponsive bureaucracy carrying out edicts from distant capitals. Today, we are dealing with a deteriorating situation in a declining institution, namely widespread ineffective instruction in the public schools....The common core's designers have taken the existing bureaucracy and increased its centralization and uniformity. By creating the common-core content standards behind closed doors, the authors increased the alienation of the public from schools as institutions worthy of loyalty. The general public had no voice in creating or adopting the common core.The common core's promoters are endeavoring to suppress competitive federalism. The common core's rules and its curriculum guidance are the governing rules of a cartel. The common core's promoters and their federal facilitators wanted a cartel that would override competitive federalism and shut down the curriculum alternatives that federalism would allow.The new common-core-aligned tests, whose development was supported with federal funds, function to police the cartel. All long-lasting cartels must have a mechanism for policing and punishing those seen as shirkers and chiselers, or, in other words, those who want to escape the cartel's strictures or who want increased flexibility so they can succeed.The new leadership of the College Board by David Coleman, one of the common core's chief architects, is being used to corral Catholic schools, other private schools, and home-schooling parents into the cartel. The proponents of the common core have now established a clearinghouse for authorized teaching materials to try to close off any remaining possible avenue of escaping the cartel.The parents note that in August of 2014, Evers testified to the Ohio House Education Committee: ""Competitive federalism encourages innovation, allows movement between jurisdictions that enhances liberty, and permits a better match between policies and voter preferences. Common Core's national uniformity runs counter to competitive federalism.""In June, Evers sounded the alarm about California's radical progressive K-12 curriculum. Writing at the Orange County Register, he observed the new framework ""is filled with present-minded paraphrases of the uplifting rhetoric of the Progressives of early 20th-century America."" He noted as well, however, that missing in the curriculum are other facts about the Progressive movement, such as their ""devotion to eugenics and their opposition to African Americans getting an academic education.""Though primarily parents and not policy experts ourselves, there is no escaping the fact that our individual and group research, writing and lobbying efforts have caused Common Core to be either repealed or modified via law and/or policy all across the nation. It is also an inescapable fact that the majority of our success in opposition grew spontaneously and fully from the interactions with our own children and schools and therefore hold specific and direct experience no mere ""policy expert"" could possess.[I]ncreasingly, parents and taxpayers view the public schools as an unresponsive bureaucracy carrying out edicts from distant capitals.

""I was not consulted or informed about this [transgender treatment] in any way.""Attorney Erick Kaardal said that her child, who is still a minor, is being changed from ""boy to girl ... without her consent and without court order,"" Pioneer Press reported.Calgaro's lawsuit challenges a Minnesota state law that allows minors to obtain medical treatment without parental consent, and claims the law is unconstitutional because it denies parental rights.Calgaro said that Park Nicollet Health Services, Fairview Health Services and the St. Louis County School District will not allow her access to her child's health records.She added that he is receiving money from state medical assistance funds to pay for medicine, including hormone treatments and narcotics, and living expenses so he can live independently.People who want to live as members of the other sex sometimes seek surgery, which is only provided after the person takes body-changing opposite-sex hormones for a year or more. The surgery is irreversible, and the hormones can also cause irreversible damage. Many parents face legal problems when trying to help their teenagers who claim to be members of the opposite sex.In 2015, Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid wrote a letter to Calgaro saying that she relinquished her legal rights over her child.The reason for this was the teen said Calgaro wasn't married when she gave birth and she did not report her child as a runaway six months after he left home, even though she had legal custody of the child.Calgaro lives in northeastern Minnesota while her son lives in central Minnesota.Calgaro doesn't oppose her son's sex-change decision for moral or religious reasons, she just wants her child to wait until he's more mature to make a life-altering decision, her lawyer said.""Not only was I robbed of the opportunity to help my son make good decisions, but I also feel he was robbed of a key advocate in his life, his mother,"" Calgaro said.A Minnesota judge ruled this week that a ban on gender reassignment surgery for those on Medicaid was unconstitutional.To learn more about the politics, science and polls related to gender issues, click here.SIGN UP"	[]	[]

Pat McCrory’s Campaign Files Protests Over Alleged Democrat-Funded PAC Voter Fraud	"Election 2016 is not over in North Carolina, where allegations of possible voter fraud now loom over a governor's race that still remains too close to call.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERRepublican incumbent Gov. Patrick McCrory is trailing his Democrat challenger, North Carolina attorney general Roy Cooper, by some 5,000 votes out of 4.6 million votes cast. The McCrory campaign, however, is filing formal protests in a challenge to ""potentially fraudulent absentee ballots cast for Roy Cooper and other Democrats in 11 additional counties,"" says a campaign press release.The campaign continues:These protests follow the discovery of a North Carolina Democrat Party-funded political action committee which appears to have paid individuals to fill out and witness hundreds of fraudulent absentee ballots for Democrats including Roy Cooper in Bladen County.In addition to funneling money to the Bladen County Improvement Association PAC, the North Carolina Democratic Party simultaneously transferred money to political action committees in these 11 counties. Similar absentee voting and handwriting patterns as in Bladen County have been discovered in at least one of these counties, suggesting these PACs may have been harvesting and witnessing multiple absentee ballots as well.Fox News reports officials in Bladen County have observed ""overtly similar"" handwriting on hundreds of absentee ballots for a separate local supervisor's race, the winner of which filed a formal complaint. The McCrory campaign, however, is alleging the PAC associated with the state's Democratic Party ""may have paid people to cast votes for a write-in Democrat in that race and every other Democrat on the ballot, including Cooper,"" says the report.""It appears that our worst fears have come true and this absentee ballot fraud scheme may run deeper than just Bladen County,"" said Russell Peck, McCrory's campaign manager. ""Unfortunately, we may also have uncovered the real reason Roy Cooper fought so hard against efforts to prevent voter fraud as attorney general. These voter fraud concerns must be addressed before the results of the election can be finalized.""As the Washington Post reports, Cooper declared victory the day after Election Day, with only a 0.5 percentage point lead, an announcement state Republican chairman Robin Hayes described as ""rude and grossly premature.""The local ABC affiliate says the final vote canvass is scheduled for Friday, and that the state's board of elections is investigating possible abnormalities with the absentee ballots in Bladen County. Additionally, the State Bureau of Investigation is still engaged in a probe of an alleged mishandling of more than 1,000 provisional ballots in the county's primary election in March.McCrory's campaign has also filed a formal protest over 94,000 early voting ballots that were not reported until after an equipment failure late in the evening on Election Day. Election board chairman in Durham County William Brian said the problem forced the need for manual ballot casts in his heavily Democratic county.The governor's campaign is also filing protests in Halifax, Edgecombe, Franklin, Guilford, Nash, Northampton, Robeson, Vance, Wake, and Warren counties, urging complete investigations into the absentee ballots and a review of witness signatures.""Many of these counties denied citizens the right to review absentee ballot envelopes to look for similar patterns, but there are thousands of absentee ballots in these 11 counties that need to be reviewed to ensure that only lawful, valid votes are counted in this election,"" says the campaign.Radical LGBT groups boosted by President Barack Obama's promotion of gender ideology have attacked McCrory this year over the state's privacy-protecting HB2 law titled the ""Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act."" The Obama administration claims the law, passed in March, violates the civil rights of gay and transgender individuals.McCrory signed the privacy and public safety bill into law to replace an ordinance in Charlotte that allowed any man who simply declared himself to be a woman to use women's restrooms. The ordinance was pushed forward by registered sex offender Chad Sevearance-Turner and national gay-advocacy groups.Subsequently, businesses, celebrities and sports entities such as the NCAA, the NBA, and the Atlantic Coast Conference pulled their entertainment and sports events out of North Carolina to support the radical agenda.The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) and Equality NC had endorsed Cooper, who has refused to defend HB2 in court.""Day after day, Pat McCrory has continued his reckless defense of the discriminatory HB2 with disregard for the very real harm inflicted on the people, reputation and economy of North Carolina,"" HRC president Chad Griffin said. ""As governor, Roy Cooper will work to repeal HB2, stand up for common decency and fight to pass statewide, LGBTQ-inclusive, non-discrimination protections.""""The choice this election couldn't be clearer,"" Griffin added. ""And we are proud to endorse Roy Cooper for Governor so that each and every LGBTQ person across North Carolina can finally live free from fear of discrimination.""Family Research Council president Tony Perkins, however, has praised McCrory for his ""political courage"" and ""moral clarity"" in refusing to cave to pressure from the sports organizations, as well as celebrities and businesses that have refused to do business in North Carolina because of the HB2 law.""He stared down the giant of the NBA and stood strong against government discrimination of private entities and for the principles of protecting privacy and safety in government buildings,"" Perkins said about McCrory.Perkins also made clear that HB2 has nothing to do with discrimination, as most in the media and gay rights advocates have portrayed it.""My home state of Louisiana, like North Carolina, is one of 32 states in the U.S. that does not force private businesses to allow men in women's showers, locker rooms, and restrooms,"" Perkins added. ""On the other hand, in New Orleans--the same as in Charlotte--the NBA will be free to divide the restrooms at its own event on the basis of self-professed ""gender identity"" instead of objective biological sex, if it wishes to do so.""Perkins said that ""only politics"" was motivating the boycott of the state - and not real concern for transgender individuals.According to one study of the 2010 census, the population of transgender people amounts to one in every 2,400 Americans, or 0.03 percent of the adult population. Multiple polls show that Obama's transgender policy is very unpopular, and the failure of Hillary Clinton - who promised to continue support for radical LGBT causes - to win the White House lends further credibility to those polls.These protests follow the discovery of a North Carolina Democrat Party-funded political action committee which appears to have paid individuals to fill out and witness hundreds of fraudulent absentee ballots for Democrats including Roy Cooper in Bladen County.

Bush's administration.The BLM manages nearly 700 million acres of federal lands in the United States. Because of tight restrictions, the ""onshore"" oil and gas wells on BLM lands accounts for just 11 percent of the natural gas supply and five percent of the oil supply in the United States.BLM leases generated just $5.4 billion in lease payments during 2013, with the majority of funds going to the U.S. Treasury to reduce deficit spending. Despite the agency's congressional mandate to maximize the value of public property, the agency website reveals the BLM has reduced issuing drilling permits every year since 2011.To justify the sudden cancellation of the decade-old Mancos drilling permits, the BLM worked with the Thompson Divide Coalition of environmentalists to commission a resource report that appeared to exist for the sole purpose of undermining energy exploration in the Mancos Shale formation, according to the Western Energy Alliance, an industry group.The timing of the cancellation of Mancos leases is especially egregious, because the United States Geological Survey just announced in June that the gas resources in the Mancos Shale formation that covers much of Northwestern and Western Colorado, has 40 times more natural gas than the USGS had projected.The USGS originally estimated in 2003 that the Mancos Shale's Piceance Basin held up to 1.6 trillion cubic feet of gas. Their latest estimate is the formation holds about 66.3 trillion cubic feet of gas.The area has now been upgraded to ""at least the second largest shale gas resource in the United States."" Its potential exceeds the size of the Bakken Shale Play"" covering North Dakota and Montana that has almost doubled U.S. oil production since 2009.""Mancos Shale Play"" is second only to the giant Marcellus gas fields that cover much of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio and New York. To get a sense of Mancos Shale potential, Marcellus dry gas production has gone from almost zero in 2008 to producing about 20 billion cubic feet of gas a day, or about 40 percent of all U.S. gas production.In fact, the U.S. is now producing so much gas that U.S. companies have built the expensive ports and specialized ships needed to export supercooled natural gas to foreign customers, including manufacturing and energy companies in the United Kingdom.

His defeated opponent, Hillary Clinton, supported a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees and an overall increase in the total number of refugees brought into the country.The message the people of the United States delivered on Election Day appears not to have been heeded by the Office of Refugee Resettlement and the State Department Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration -- the two agencies in the federal government with statutory responsibility for resettling refugees.A Breitbart-Gravis poll conducted the week prior to the election showed that, by a 59 percent to 28 percent margin, voters opposed increasing the number of refugees resettled in the country.The post-election FY 2017 daily rate of new refugee arrivals is 331. The pre-election FY 2017 daily rate of new refugee arrivals was 311.The story is the same for the arrival of Syrian refugees.In the eight days since Trump won the election, the Obama administration has brought 338 Syrian refugees into the country, or 42 each day, a slightly higher rate than the 1,602 Syrian refugees, or 40 each day, brought in during the first forty days of FY 2017.From October 1 to November 16, the Obama administration brought in a total of 15,125 refugees, an annualized run rate of approximately 117,000 refugees.This is a higher rate than the 110,000 refugees the Obama administration has proposed to Congress in the FY Budget that has yet to be passed, and significantly higher than the 85,000 refugees who were resettled in the United States during FY 2016.From October 1 to November 16, the Obama administration brought in a total of 1,950 Syrian refugees, an annualized run rate of approximately 15,000 Syrian refugees, which is 20 percent higher than the 12,500 Syrian refugees resettled in the country during FY 2016.Currently, the federal government is operating under an interim ten week budget that expires on December 9.Such interim budgets usually continue funding for all federal departments and agencies at the level of the prior fiscal year.That fact raises an obvious question: Where are the Office of Refugee Resettlement and the Department of State Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration obtaining the additional funds to resettle refugees at a higher rate during the first month-and-a-half of FY 2017 than it did during FY 2016?The other question is this: How will the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the Department of State Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, and the voluntary agencies (VOLAGs) hired by the federal government to resettle refugees respond when President Trump suspends the Syrian refugee program, the refugee programs from other countries that are hostile to the United States (most likely Somalia would be included in this list), and enforces the ""consultation clause"" of the Refugee Act of 1980?At a campaign rally in Minneapolis two days before Election Day, President-elect Trump said, ""a Trump administration will not admit any refugees without the support of the local community where they are being placed.""""Current law leaves refugee admissions up to presidential discretion, and he could accomplish this on Day One,"" David Bier of the Cato Institute told the Thompsons Reuter Foundation a day after Trump's win.""[B]arring refugees from countries with large Muslim populations would be easy to enforce and, assuming no reallocation, could reduce refugee flows by 40 percent,"" Bier added.The Obama administration has 65 more days until President-elect Trump's inauguration on January 21, 2017. There is no indication that it intends to reduce the rate of refugee arrivals in the country between now and then.How quickly the incoming Trump administration will be able to implement its new refugee policies will depend on two factors: the types and timing of executive orders the new president will sign related to refugee policy, and the rapidity with which it appoints a new director of Office of Refugee Resettlement and assistant secretary for the State Department Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration.SIGN UP"	['Trump', 'Obama']	[]

A combination of sources -- including official confirmation from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) -- revealed the men were in fact apprehended and are currently in U.S. federal custody.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBreitbart Texas sources first released the information and CBP confirmed via email. CPB responded:U.S. Border Patrol agents in Nogales, AZ, apprehended three Pakistani nationals on Nov. 11. As a standard procedure, agents processed the individuals and checked their identities against numerous law enforcement and national security related databases. Record checks revealed no derogatory information about the individuals. The individuals are currently in Federal custody while they await the outcome of their immigration cases.Additional information on the individuals was obtained by federal agents working under the umbrella of CBP, but it is important to note that the additional details were not confirmed by CBP.""One of them had a shit load of hits from a bunch of places he's been. He had entered and exited numerous countries that were not in his route to the U.S. This raises red flags because people leaving a foreign country to come here usually take the quickest route, but one of them did not,"" said one of the sources.The source continued, ""One of the men had his hair died blonde to disguise his appearance and all of the men spoke perfect English.""Breitbart Texas previously broke the news that five men from Pakistan and one from Afghanistan were caught within 17 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border in the same vicinity as the current apprehensions of Pakistani men. In that case, the FBI later confirmed to other news outlets that the details from Breitbart Texas sources were correct.Brandon Darby is managing director and editor-in-chief of Breitbart Texas.
